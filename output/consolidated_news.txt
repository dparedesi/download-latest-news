The latest expected pick is Kelly Loeffler, who Trump is reportedly about to pick for secretary of agriculture. Loeffler, a Republican senator from Georgia, reportedly sold $20 million in stock just days before the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) "pandemic" was declared. Back then, Loeffler was appointed to her seat "against President Trump's wishes," NPR reported. Now, Trump apparently wants Loeffler to occupy a top position in his cabinet. Trump and his allies pushed for Rep. Doug Collins to take what would have been a vacant seat, but that seat was ultimately filled by Gov. Brian Kemp with Loeffler. "She dumped millions in stock in companies to be affected by Covid after a classified briefing on the virus before a pandemic was declared," tweeted Whitney Webb (@_whitneywebb) about Loeffler's insider trading scandal during COVID. (Related: Did you know that just one day before Thomas Matthew Crooks reportedly tried to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump back in the summer a private equity firm out of Austin called Austin Private Wealth reported massive short bets on $DJT and $RUM stocks, which is similar to what happened right before 9/11?) Loeffler's husband co-owns crypto platform that Trump media wants to buy Loeffler's husband Jeffrey Sprecher is also part of a newfound effort to privatize natural resources like air and water through so-called "natural asset corporations." Sprecher, who chairs the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), joined the Rockefeller-backed IEG to implement natural asset corporations that are designed to securitize nature, "particularly parts of the natural world that have up to this point been considered part of the 'global commons' including clean air and water," Webb notes. "It can be used for predatory land grabs, especially troubling for a prospective head of the USDA." Webb further warns that Sprecher partially owns Bakkt, a cryptocurrency firm that Trump's media company just so happens to want to purchase. Once Trump is in office and Loeffler is head of the USDA, it appears as though the next step is for Trump to grease a deal with Sprecher that will benefit the two's private endeavors. A former board member of Trump's media company, by the way, is right now working to turn the precious Amazon rainforest into the world's first "internet of forests." The goal will be to monetize collected data while surveilling and ultimately ending the sovereignty of locals who live there. The same former Trump media company board member wants to tokenize each hectare of the Amazon rainforest with the help of a former top executive at BlackRock "who essentially invented ETFs," according to Webb. "Wall Street is trying to turn all of nature into tradable financial products and it seems like the next admin is down for that (esp. incoming head of Commerce Howard Lutnick!)," Webb warns. Natural asset companies, in case you did not know, are the epitome of climate change nonsense. They involve things like carbon credits, carbon capture, net zero, and more. "Most of the people around Trump's circle are Wall Street investors and they will get even richer in the next four years," warned someone on X / Twitter about the Trump grift. "They give the impression they will cut waste but will instead cut programs which will hurt working Americans." "I feel nauseous," wrote another who feels duped by Trump. "Humanity is not on a good trajectory and the fix (if there is one) seems beyond politics." The latest Trump-related news can be found at Trump.news.

Title: Even a dodgy Firework couldn’t mar day to remember for Gus McCarthy

As debuts go, not least for a 21-year-old hooker, it wasn’t too bad. A try, three try assists, playing the full 80 minutes, the last six of them in the back row, and Ireland winning 52-17 at home in front of extended family and friends. Not even in his wildest dreams could Gus McCarthy have concocted all of that. In a highly impressive, mobile and skilful display made, they are memories that McCarthy admitted he’ll cherish for the rest of his life. There are other too, not least hearing and singing the anthems. As that dream became a reality, as he thought of the route to this point, and those who helped him along the way, the tears streamed down his face. “I was pretty emotional, just because it’s always been a dream of mine growing up. I’ve always come to the games and sang the anthems. It was just a really, really proud moment, not only for myself, but more thinking of my family and the journey to get to there.” It’s funny how McCarthy and Sam Prendergast, the two 21-year-olds, took such contrasting routes to last Saturday’s landmark day for them both. McCarthy was captain, and Prendergast the undoubted star turn, in the Ireland under-20s side that won a Grand Slam and reached the Under-20 World Cup two seasons ago. Prendergast was fast-tracked into Leinster’s first team squad, making his first two starts later that season in South Africa, and his 16 appearances last season, amounting to 473 minutes, led to him being included in Ireland’s squad for the two-Test series in South Africa. By contrast, McCarthy played only 25 minutes for Leinster that season, in their April trek to South Africa, but all changed when Dan Sheehan suffered his ACL injury in the first Test before Rónan Kelleher, Lee Barron and John McKee were all struck down this season. In addition to four starts for Leinster and two for Emerging Ireland, McCarthy was hauled back from that tour to play the second half of the marquee Croke Park fixture. “I probably still haven’t taken in how lucky I have been to get some chances but I’m sure over the next few months I will reflect on that.” McCarthy reckons he played about half a dozen AIL 1A games with UCD last season, and while agreeing that it is a huge jump to Test rugby, he stressed: “But, no, I wouldn’t talk down AIL. There are some physical men. I’m trying to think of my last one. It potentially could have been Ballynahinch away or something like that, which is not a glamour fixture. We actually got pumped.” McCarthy started this season in the Leinster academy and so was, effectively, their fifth-choice hooker. “As well as Dan and Rónan there’s two other great hookers in John McKee and Lee Barron at Leinster, so I’m still competing with a lot. With the five of us it’s very competitive, anyone can step up and perform, as we’ve seen with the lads in the last few years. “So, I’ve just said to myself or when I’m speaking to my parents, and my dad especially, any opportunity I get I have to try to take it. I can’t wait around, especially in training. I just have to try to put my best foot forward and impress the coaches when I get a chance.” In the long term, it’s difficult to see how they can all remain with the province, but that’s another day’s discussion. Even after his unexpected flurry of game time with Leinster, McCarthy was only named as one of five “training panellists” in addition to the 35-man squad for this Series, behind three other hookers, so when he was named to start against Fiji he was as surprised as anybody. “When Faz [Andy Farrell] named the team on Monday I was incredibly surprised. I only got the call on Sunday evening at around 7pm that I was coming back in on Monday. I thought I was going to be back in Leinster this week. So then when I got the call that I was coming in to camp I thought I’d maybe get the chance to be 24th man and experience the match day. Then when I saw Faz put up the team and I was starting I was full of emotions. I was incredibly excited but also nervous.” His week had featured other highs, not least being presented with his jersey by a fellow former Blackrock College player and captain. “Caelan [Doris] actually gave me the jersey in the Shelbourne on Thursday night, which was very special: a fellow Blackrock man and to have the captain of your country present you with your jersey is very special.” To complete his day, after the game McCarthy saw his parents, Robert and Australian-born mum Tara, sisters Naoise and Millie and brother Hubie, as well as cousins and uncles. There was only one blemish. McCarthy was speaking to a small group of journalists in a passageway near the dressingrooms after Saturday’s game, where he was about to return and ready himself for something more daunting than starting his first Test match. That was to be his debut song in front of the squad. He revealed: “I’ll give a terrible rendition of Firework by Katie Perry.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Nvidia nearly doubles AMD's R&D budget – Intel's spending dwarfs both, but struggles to compete

The big picture: The competitive strength of hardware makers is often gauged by their research and development expenditure. However, an analysis of recent financial reports from various tech giants reveals that higher R&D spending does not always guarantee success. Intel's recent struggles and Nvidia's astronomical growth driven by the AI boom have broken conventional assumptions. Recent insights from Tech Fund reveal a widening disparity in R&D budgets between competing hardware makers AMD and Nvidia, a key factor in Nvidia's increasing market dominance. In that same mix we could look at Intel, which currently appears much weaker than both despite dwarfing their R&D spending. According to Tech Fund's analysis of Nvidia's and AMD's R&D expenditures over the past decade, Nvidia now spends twice as much as AMD. In 2013, their R&D budgets were roughly equal, but Nvidia's has since surged to approximately $12 billion, while AMD's has grown to ~$6 billion. $NVDA is widening the R&D gap with its closest competitor. Annualizing last quarter's R&D spend, NVDA is investing now almost at twice the level of $AMD. And the latter will have to split R&D between GPUs, CPUs and FPGAs, whereas NVDA can fully focus on building out the AI stack. pic.twitter.com/nL4BpTPNeU This disparity is further accentuated by the allocation of spending. Nvidia focuses nearly all its R&D efforts on AI, while AMD's smaller budget is spread across GPUs, CPUs, AI, and FPGA chips. Although AMD has made impressive gains in the CPU market – recent generations of its CPUs have soundly defeated Intel – it continues to struggle against Nvidia in the GPU sector. Intel currently faces seemingly endless trouble in CPUs, GPUs, and other areas despite outspending Nvidia's and AMD's R&D by a wide margin. Source: Tom's Hardware (click to enlarge) According to Tom's Hardware, Intel allocated $16 billion to R&D in 2023 – double the combined budgets of Nvidia and AMD. For 2024, the company projects R&D, market growth, and acquisition costs will range between $17 billion and $20 billion. These funds are spread across diverse ventures, including CPUs, GPUs, quantum computing, and foundries, with significant hopes pinned on its forthcoming 18A process node. Source: App Economy Insights Despite this hefty investment, Intel's market capitalization hovers at around $107 billion, ranking 160th globally. In contrast, AMD ranks 45th with a valuation of $229 billion or more than twice of Chipzilla's. Nvidia, with its near-total devotion to AI, has entered the $3 trillion club and is vying with Apple for the title of the world's most valuable company. Nvidia's meteoric rise is particularly striking when compared to Apple's R&D spending. The Cupertino giant spent $27 billion on R&D in 2023 and $31 billion between September 2023 and September 2024. While some predict the eventual collapse of the AI bubble, which could bring Nvidia back down to Earth, there are no immediate signs of such a downturn.

Title: Asia’s Largest Digital Bank Launches Retail Crypto Trading In Hong Kong—Details

Time Published: 2024-11-26T02:30:17Z

Hong Kong’s largest digital bank, ZA Bank, has announced the launch of a retail cryptocurrency trading service. According to the press release, the service enables users to trade cryptocurrencies directly through the ZA Bank app, “simplifying” the trading process by eliminating the need for third-party platforms. This move makes ZA Bank the first bank in Asia to offer such services to retail customers, reflecting the region’s growing interest in digital asset adoption. The trading platform is designed to support transactions in Hong Kong dollars (HKD) and US dollars (USD), allowing users to trade leading cryptocurrencies. To deliver this functionality, ZA Bank has partnered with HashKey Exchange, one of the three licensed digital currency exchanges in Hong Kong. The release revealed that HashKey’s institutional-grade platform, HashKey Pro, provides API trading, block trade services, and “enhanced” account management features, ensuring “secure and efficient trading” for users. Calvin Ng, Alternate Chief Executive of ZA Bank, noted: The rise of cryptocurrency presents investors with more diverse asset allocation opportunities. As a bank, we prioritise security and compliance, which is why we’ve partnered with HashKey, a global-leading licensed virtual asset exchange, to meet regulatory standards and deliver bank-grade security in virtual assets trading – our key competitive advantage in the Asian market. HashKey Exchange plays a crucial role in ZA Bank’s foray into the crypto sector. ZA Bank revealed in the press release that the collaboration leverages HashKey Pro’s infrastructure to “seamlessly” integrate digital currency trading into the ZA Bank app. HashKey Exchange CEO Livio Weng emphasized the broader implications of this partnership, stating that the initiative aims to drive the growth of the Web3 ecosystem in Hong Kong. We are privileged to partner with ZA Bank in advancing innovation in digital banking services across Asia. As Hong Kong’s largest licensed virtual asset exchange, HashKey Exchange is dedicated to providing users with fully compliant and secure digital asset trading solutions. ZA Bank, as the first bank in Asia to offer such service, has demonstrated its strong leadership and a pioneering spirit in fintech integration. Weng noted that as one of the three licensed exchanges in the region, alongside OSL and HKVAX, HashKey is positioned to support the digital asset industry’s compliance with regulatory standards. Overall, it is worth noting that this collaboration highlights Hong Kong’s efforts to establish itself as a leading hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. In addition, collaboration and adoption have come when the cryptocurrency market has consistently seen recognition from major institutions and even countries. Recently, BlackRock launched options trading on its crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) product.

Title: ‘Any opportunity I get, I have to try and take it’ – Gus McCarthy knows what he must do with Ireland pecking order

Ireland's Gus McCarthy during the Autumn Nations Series match against Fiji. Photo: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile It’s hard to remember a better debut or a faster rise than Gus McCarthy’s. At the start of this season, the 21-year-old hooker had made a solitary bench appearance for Leinster on their tour of South Africa, and were it not for injury, he’d have likely lined out for their ‘A’ side against Munster on Friday night. Instead, he has propelled himself into Andy Farrell’s Ireland thoughts after making the most of others’ misfortune. That, in essence, is the game. He came into this season as Leinster’s fifth-choice hooker, but injuries to the other four opened the door in pre-season. He impressed and earned the No 2 jersey for the season opener, making such an impact that he was called up to the Emerging Ireland tour and then called home early to start at Croke Park against Munster. Still in the Academy, he earned a spot in Ireland’s squad as a ‘training panellist’ and was ready to go back to Leinster last Sunday, until he got a tap on the shoulder. He teared up when singing the anthem and his first lineout went astray, but when the whistle blew he was the picture of calm. He threw his first assist for Caelan Doris’s opening try, followed it up with a pre-assist a few minutes later and then offloaded out of the tackle for Craig Casey’s score. After half-time, he got over for a try of his own and set up Bundee Aki for his score. Aki got man of the match, but the hooker was hard done by. He may have been nervous, but the 2023 Ireland U-20s captain delivered an excellent performance – one that is rooted in his days playing minis rugby at Old Belvedere and his school days at Blackrock College. “Growing up, I’ve always played with the rugby ball in hand, always messing around with mates, whether it be at school or in the garden or at home,” he reflected. “I’d just see where the space is, and kind of scan up. “That is something I have to keep working on. Faz (Andy Farrell) is massive on scanning early, so that is something I have to keep working on. I was kind of happy. There’s a few chances that I saw an opportunity to give it early.” McCarthy wasn’t expecting to make the step up so soon. “When Faz named the team on Monday, I was incredibly surprised,” he said. “I only got the call on Sunday evening at around 7pm that I was coming back in on Monday. I thought I was going to be back in Leinster this week. “I thought I’d maybe get the chance to be 24th man and experience the match-day experience. “Then when I saw Faz put up the team and I was starting, I was full of emotions. I was incredibly excited but also nervous. “I was pretty emotional [during the anthems] just because it’s always been a dream of mine growing up. “I’ve always come to the games and sang the anthems. It was just a really, really proud moment, not only for myself but more thinking of my family and the journey to get there. It was just a proud moment for me and my family.” Already, there is a rush to get McCarthy out of Leinster where Dan Sheehan and Rónan Kelleher are established options. Kelleher is likely to start against Australia and Sheehan is back after Christmas, while Lee Barron and John McKee will have a chance to impress in McCarthy’s absence against Ulster this week. He knows he’s in a battle for game-time, but you sense he’ll back himself to get into that match-day 23. “As well as Dan and Ronan, there are two other great hookers in John McKee and Lee Barron at Leinster, so I’m still competing with a lot,” he said. “With the five of us, it’s very competitive, anyone can step up and perform, as we’ve seen with the lads. “So, I’ve just said to myself, or when I’m speaking to my parents, and my dad especially, that any opportunity I get, I have to try and take it. I can’t wait around, especially in training. I just have to try and put my best foot forward and impress the coaches when I get a chance.”

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “”The important thing is not to stop questioning; curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when contemplating the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of the mystery every day. The important thing is not to stop questioning; never lose a holy curiosity.” – Albert Einstein (from statement to William Miller, as quoted in LIFE magazine (May 2, 1955)) Number of the Week: 14 Drilling Records THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week begins with Richard Lindzen’s discussion on recent political movements that falsely claim to be based on science. Vijay Jayaraj discusses a conference of important nations that the legacy media missed, or misrepresented. Delancyplace.com discusses a few issues in Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Roy Spencer and John Christy discuss corrections needed to the measurements by satellites when the satellites drift too far from the planned orbit. Owen Klinsky alerts the US to the Winter Reliability Assessment by North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). Roger Caiazza continues to express concern over New York’s future reliance on Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resources (DEFR), that appears imaginary. A brief discussion on a Bomb Cyclone concludes this Week. ************* Rumors State: Some of the most misleading arguments for drastic action to “combat climate change” include phrases such as “The Science says.” Science says nothing; in physical science it is the physical evidence that reveals the validity of a claim. Writing in the American Mind, MIT Professor emeritus of Atmospheric Science Richard Lindzen reveals “How a political movement invented its own scientific basis.” He begins with: “Modern political movements have frequently laid claim to being based in science, from immigration restriction and eugenics (in the U.S. after WWI), to antisemitism and race ideology (in Hitler’s Germany), to Communism and Lysenkoism (under Stalin). Each of these falsely invoked a scientific consensus that convinced highly educated citizens, who were nonetheless ignorant of science, to set aside the anxieties associated with their ignorance. Since all scientists supposedly agreed, there was no need for them to understand the science. Of course, this version of “the science” is the opposite of science itself. Science is a mode of inquiry rather than a source of authority. However, the success that science achieves has earned it a measure of authority in the public’s mind. This is what politicians frequently envy and exploit. The climate panic fits into this same pattern and, as in all the preceding cases, science is in fact irrelevant. At best, it is a distraction which has led many of us to focus on the numerous misrepresentations of science entailed in what was purely a political movement.” Lindzen traces how the political movement began to demonize carbon dioxide, essential for photosynthesis, which creates the food required for all complex life, then asserts: “Excited politicians, confronted by this resistance, have frantically changed their story. Rather than emphasizing small changes in their temperature metric (which, itself, is a false measure of climate), they now point to weather extremes which occur almost daily some place on earth, as proof not only of climate change but of climate change due to increasing CO2 (and now also to even more negligible contributors to the greenhouse effect like methane and nitrous oxide). Such extremes show no significant correlation with the emissions. From the political point of view, however, extremes provide convenient visuals that have more emotional impact than small temperature changes. Birth of a Consensus The desperation of political figures often drives them as far as to claim that climate change is an existential threat (associated with alleged “tipping points”). This despite a complete absence of theoretical or observational support, and despite the fact that official documents produced to support climate concerns (for example, the Working Group 1 reports of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC) never come close to substantiating these worst-case projections. There was one exception to the obsession with warming, and that was the ozone depletion issue. However, even this issue served a purpose. When Richard Benedick, the American negotiator of the Montreal Convention which banned Freon, passed through MIT on his way back from Montreal, he gloated over his success. But he assured us that we hadn’t seen anything yet: we should wait to see what they would do with CO2. In brief, the ozone issue constituted a dry run for global warming. To be sure, the EPA’s activities still include conventional pollution control, but energy dominates. Of course, the attraction of power is not the only thing motivating politicians. The ability to award trillions of dollars to reorient our energy sector means that there are recipients of these trillions of dollars. These recipients must share just a few percentage points of these trillions of dollars to support the campaigns of these politicians for many election cycles and guarantee the support of these politicians for the policies associated with the reorientation.” The essay is a severe indictment of the IPCC and its collaborators who ignore the physical evidence in favor of politicized reports as found in the IPCC Summaries for Policymakers. Now in the 29th annual meeting (COP-29), the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are demanding trillions of dollars in payment for the imagined harm that carbon dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels are claimed to cause. Yet the use of fossil fuels (hydrocarbons) helped take the bulk of humanity out of dire poverty. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and After Paris! ************* Ignoring the Other World: In the sound and fury created by COP-29, the legacy media ignored or misrepresented another international conference that may become more important than the UN conferences – the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, now including other nations) conference held October 22 to October 24. Vijay Jayaraj of the CO2 Coalition writes: “Attendees of the 16th annual BRICS summit represented more than 45% of the global population and 35% of global gross domestic product and included representatives of Saudi Arabia, China, India, Brazil, and the United Arab Emirates. At the heart of the declaration lies a fundamental truth that the Western climate industrial complex often refuses to recognize: Access to affordable and reliable energy and economic development cannot be sacrificed at the altar of ‘decarbonization’ if people are to thrive. The BRICS leaders emphasize that their immediate goals — poverty eradication, infrastructure development, and economic expansion — require a secure and stable energy supply.” In BRICS-16’s Kazan Declaration, the attendees recognize that the path to prosperity is not from demanding payments from others for alleged harms from carbon dioxide, but by promoting affordable and reliable energy, as it has been since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The environmental ills created by industrialization can be and are cleaned up and are minor compared to the ills of extreme poverty. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ************* Randomness: The daily blog, Delancyplace.com, was founded by Richard Vague and financed by the Governor’s Woods Foundation. It has no particular theme but produces interesting tidbits. On November 20, it covered Randomness and Reality. The piece began with: “Today’s selection–from Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Randomness comes to Wall Street: “’Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands, of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. The point is dubbed in this book the black swan problem, which we cover in Chapter 7, as it is linked to the problem of induction, a problem that has kept a few thinkers awake at night. It is also related to a problem called denigration of history, as gamblers, investors, and decision-makers feel that the sorts of things that happen to others would not necessarily happen to them. “’Second, unlike a well-defined, precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. Very rarely is the generator visible to the naked eye. One is thus capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette—and calling it by some alternative ‘low risk’ name. We see the wealth being generated, never the processor, a matter that makes people lose sight of their risks, and never consider the losers. The game seems terribly easy, and we play along carelessly. Even scientists with all their sophistication in calculating probabilities cannot deliver any meaningful answer about the odds, since knowledge of these depends on our witnessing the barrel of reality—of which we generally know nothing.’” Randomness occurs, such as an asteroid striking Earth and wiping out a whole class of life on Earth. These cannot be predicted or the causes known until after they occur. In climate history there appear to be random events that have not been explained such as the Younger Dryas, a period about 12,900 to 11,700 years ago beginning with sudden cooling and ending with sudden warming. Most life survived the Younger Dryas, a fact that is ignored by those who claim that the current slow warming will eliminate many species. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Changing Seas. ************* Imperfect Instruments: On November 2, Roy Spencer posted the October 2024 estimates of temperature trends which contains an explanation of a shift in calculations and why it was necessary. TWTW waited until the full Global Temperature Report for October by John Christy and Spencer was available before discussing this change. The full report is available now. Earlier Spencer wrote: [Boldface in Original] “Key Points Background Monitoring of global atmospheric deep-layer temperatures with satellite microwave radiometers (systems originally designed for daily global weather monitoring) has always required corrections and adjustments to the calibrated data to enable long-term trend detection. The most important of these corrections/adjustments are: The second of these adjustments (diurnal drift) is the subject of the change made going from UAH v6.0 to v6.1. The following chart shows the equator crossing times (local solar time) for the various satellites making up the satellite temperature record. The drift of the satellites (except the non-drifting Aqua and MetOp satellites, which have fuel onboard to allow orbit maintenance) produces cooling for the afternoon satellites’ LT measurements as the afternoon observation transitions from early afternoon to evening. Drift of the morning satellites makes their LT temperatures warm as their evening observations transition to the late afternoon.” Spencer graphically shows the drift in satellites used since 1979 with various truncations including the one for NOAA-19 and explains: “Note that the NOAA-19 satellite has drifted further in local observation time than any of the previous afternoon satellites. The NOAA-19 local observation times have been running outside our training dataset which includes the assumption of a linear diurnal temperature drift with time. So, we have decided it is now necessary to truncate the data from NOAA-19 starting in 2021, which we are now doing as of the October 2024 update. Thus, begins Version 6.1 of our dataset, a name change meant to reduce confusion and indicate a significant change in our processing. As seen in the above figure [not shown here], 2020 as the last year of NOAA-19 data inclusion is roughly consistent with the v6.0 cutoff times from the NOAA-18 and NOAA-14 (afternoon) satellites. This type of change in our processing is analogous to changes we have made in previous years, after a few years of data being collected to firmly establish a problem exists. The time lag is necessary because we have previously found that two operating satellites in different orbits can diverge in their processed temperatures, only to converge again later. As will be shown below, we now have sufficient reason to truncate the NOAA-19 data record starting in 2021. Why Do We Even Include a Satellite if it is Drifting in Local Observation Time? The reasons why a diurnally drifting satellite is included in processing (with imperfect adjustments) are three-fold: (1) most satellites in the 1979-2024 period of record drifted, and so their inclusion was necessary to make a complete, intercalibrated satellite record of temperatures; (2) two operational satellites (usually one drifting much more than the other) provide more complete sampling during the month for our gridded dataset, which has 2.5 deg. lat/lon resolution; (3) having two (or sometimes 3) satellites allows monitoring of potential drifts, i.e., the time series of the difference between 2 satellite measurements should remain relatively stable over time. Version 6.1 Brings the UAH Data closer to RSS and NOAA in the Last Few Years Several people have noted that our temperature anomalies have been running warmer than those from the RSS or NOAA satellite products. It now appears this was due to the orbital drift of NOAA-19 beyond the useful range of our drift correction. The following plot (preliminary, provided to me by John Christy) [plot in original and not shown here] shows that truncation of the NOAA-19 record now brings the UAH anomalies more in line with the RSS and NOAA products.” [Boldface added here] Spencer stated that the full explanation by Christy and him may take a few days “due to the changes resulting from going from v6.0 to v6.1 of the dataset.” On this issue the post on the “Global Temperature Report: October 2024 with Version 6.1” state: “In the last two months we’ve suggested some reasons for the continued exceptional warmth of the global atmosphere even as the El Niño was fading away. One of the causes mentioned was the possibility that the correction for the drift of the aging NOAA-19 satellite was unable to keep up with its continued movement and produced spurious warmth over the last few years. By comparing the two current satellites, and especially since Europe’s MetOP-B does not drift due to on-board propulsion, we’ve concluded that the adjustment for NOAA-19’s drift was inadequate, generating temperatures that were too warm as time went on. This same situation has occurred in the past where we initially utilized old satellites beyond their normal lifespan (e.g., NOAA-14, -15, -18 and AQUA) and retroactively removed the latest portion of their records when errors progressively became large enough to affect the anomalies of the last few years. We have now decided to terminate the inclusion of NOAA-19 from 2021 onward. With this adjustment we will identify the product as v6.1. At some point in the near future, we intend to include MetOp-C in the record, so this may introduce some minor changes at that time. This adjustment produces cooler temperatures after 2021 but does not change the facts that (a) 2023 was the warmest calendar year (and 2024 will be warmer still), (b) April 2024 produced the warmest single monthly anomaly, and (c) every month from October 2023 to September 2024 set monthly temperature records. The overall global trend was reduced slightly from +0.16 to +0.15 °C/decade by this adjustment.” [Boldface added] Instruments fail, and when they cannot be replaced, adjustments must be made for the failure. Unlike the adjustments to the historic US surface dataset made by NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI), Asheville, the adjustments made by Spencer and Christy are public, carefully identified and justified, and recorded. Their actions demonstrate integrity in science, a characteristic which NCEI, Asheville lost.

Klinsky writes: “Grid operators have requested the EPA nix the power plant rule in order to protect long-term energy dependability, with four major regional operators filing an amicus brief in support of red states’ legal challenge against the rule, stating it would jeopardize the grid’s ability to reliably meet American energy needs.” The Winter Reliability Assessment of NERC covers the three-month (December-February) winter period and evaluates the generation resource and transmission system adequacy necessary to meet projected winter peak demands and operating reserves. The assessment identifies potential reliability issues of interest and regional risks. It states: “Natural gas fuel to generators is threatened this winter by ongoing concerns with natural gas production and delivery in extreme conditions and a potential regional pipeline capacity issue in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Natural gas is an essential fuel for electricity generation in winter. While the natural gas industry is making progress on commercial practices and voluntary commitments to improve winter preparedness, supplies to electric generators remain vulnerable in extreme cold temperatures in many parts of North America, placing electric reliability at risk. As winter approaches, NERC encourages all entities across the gas-electric value chain—from production to the burner tip and the busbar—to take all necessary actions to prepare for extreme cold, keep natural gas flowing, and keep the lights and furnaces on. At the time of this WRA, the operator of a major interstate natural gas pipeline expansion project serving the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Northeast is facing legal challenges to the continued operation of the expanded pipeline. According to a recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) filing, a halting of the expanded pipeline operations would affect “firm transportation capacity in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.” These states correspond to the PJM, NPCC-New York, SERC-East, and SERC-Southeast assessment areas. During recent extreme winter weather events, each of these areas has experienced or come dangerously close to a shortfall in electricity supply for which fuel availability was a significant factor. Because foreseeable extreme cold temperatures have the potential to push the existing natural gas supply infrastructure to maximum capacity again this winter, a shutdown of in-service regional natural gas facilities would endanger grid reliability.” The failure of natural gas power plants in Texas during the last Blue Norther severe cold was due to the failure to have adequate supplies of natural gas on hand. This was a failure of the “just in time” policies of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). If this winter is cold, we will see whether this EPA and litigating environmental groups care about electrical reliability for the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast states.

Caiazza summarizes his previous work and presents another analysis by Tim Knauss, based on the work of Cornell’s Anderson Lab headed by Lindsay Anderson. Knauss writes: “To back up the massive quantities of solar and wind power that will provide most of our future electricity, the state power grid will need some new, mystery resource equal in size to the entire generating fleet of today. That level of detail sets their work apart. Many of the studies that look at phasing in renewable energy pretend that the electric grid is a single pool of electrons that flow from point to point without constraint. It is known as the ‘copper plate’ assumption. In reality, the New York electric grid is a complex, lopsided network that has been stitched together piece by piece over a century. There are limits on how much electric current can move from one area to another. Based on Anderson’s work, Knauss writes: “At Cornell University, Professor Lindsay Anderson and fellow researchers have been studying this problem. Given the specific layout of New York’s electric grid, they asked, how much of this new power source would be needed in addition to all the solar and wind? A staggering amount, it turns out. Just 15 years from now, the electric grid will need about 40 gigawatts of new generating capacity that can be activated regardless of wind speeds, cloud cover or other weather conditions, according to Anderson’s research. How much is that? It’s roughly equal to the total capacity of all of New York’s current power plants – nuclear, natural gas, hydro, wind, all of it.” The enormous needs for back-up to wind and solar have been noted elsewhere, and completely ignored by those promoting Net Zero. See links under Energy Issues – US. ************* Bomb Cyclone: A rapid intensification of a cyclone is often referred to by colorful weather commentators as a bomb cyclone. The implication is that it is not predictable. In WUWT, Caribbean sailor Kip Hansen showed a video of a cyclone off the Northwest Coast of the US, and he considered it to be a bomb cyclone. Meteorologist Cliff Mass, in the Northwest, has a daily series on his blog showing that the cyclone was well predicted over five days. See links under Changing Weather. ************* Number of the Week: 14 Drilling Records. The paper authored by Thomas Westerhold and 23 others “An astronomically dated record of Earth’s climate and its predictability over the last 66 million years” in AAAS Science on Sep 11, 2020, was based on 14 drilling records compiled in the International Ocean Discovery Program and its predecessor programs. As discussed in the July 15, 2023, TWTW, when Willis Eschenbach unraveled the data, it revealed that contrary to the assertion that Earth’s temperatures changed with changing CO2; Earth’s temperatures remained roughly constant with significant changes in CO2. See https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba6853 for the paper and https://www.sepp.org/twtwfiles/2023/TWTW%207-15-23.pdf for the TWTW.

It calculates radiation reactions and radiation transport processes in all possible gases and gas mixtures according to the latest scientific and technical standards. Changes in atmospheric composition and density as well as their evolution with increasing altitude can be taken into account. HITRAN is used by scientists as well as satellite operators, meteorologists and the military due to the quality of its results. [SEPP Comment: HITRAN is the best database publicly available, but the precise number CO2 causing a warming of only 0.24°C is not clear.] Challenging the Orthodoxy Global Temperature Report: October 2024 with Version 6.1 By John Christy, Roy Spencer, Nov 4, 20224 Click to access GTR_202410OCT_v1.pdf Link to: UAH v6.1 Global Temperature Update for October 2024: +0.73 deg.

[SEPP Comment: Additional false claims of probabilities are exposed by Clark.] Tidbits By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 20, 2024 Politicians start with a dream, and when it goes sour, they too often refuse to admit it and instead prop it up. But the cost to the rest of us, including the poor to whom this money does not go directly from their fellows in charity or via the state, and the middle class whose power bills keep skyrocketing because politicians don’t know what “cheap” even means, is enormous. And how much are politicians’ delusions really worth anyway? We’re all Doomed. Yawn By Michael Kile, WUWT, Nov 21, 2024 Such a view arguably becomes more credible on discovering that WWA’s main benefactor is The Grantham Institute. It sits “at the heart of Imperial College London’s work on climate change and the environment, with the mission: “to lead on world-class research, policy, training and innovation that supports effective action on climate change.” [Italics by Kile] Grantham is right. Climate change has become a global “business”, presumably very profitable for “carbon” cowboys or green investors like GMO, at least unless the RE music stops for some reason, such as a decline in public gullibility about the “climate crisis”. Climate Debate on Social Media: Are the ‘Skeptics’ Winning? By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, Nov 22, 2024 After Paris! Green Activists Are Coming for Your Money By Paul Mueller, The Daily Economy, Nov 18, 2024 Cheap energy means a future of greater freedom and prosperity for everyone. Because eliminating all emissions is next to impossible, companies are being encouraged (or required) to buy offsets from other companies or countries that purport to pull a certain amount of carbon out of the air. There are many reasons to be skeptical of this whole project. The efficacy of carbon offsets is highly questionable because they create all kinds of bad incentives.

The proposal would require these plants to cut their emissions of pollutants known as nitrogen oxides, which can lead to smog formation and contribute to asthma in people with long-term exposure. From ATSDR sheet: HIGHLIGHTS: Everybody is exposed to small amounts of nitrogen oxides in ambient air. Higher exposure may occur by burning wood or kerosene or near gas stoves or if you smoke. Exposure to high levels of nitrogen oxides can damage the respiratory airways. Contact with the skin or eyes can cause burns. Nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide have been found in at least 9 and 6 of the 1,585 National Priorities List sites identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), respectively. What are nitrogen oxides? Nitrogen oxides are a mixture of gases that are composed of nitrogen and oxygen. Two of the most toxicologically significant nitrogen oxides are nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide; both are nonflammable and colorless to brown at room temperature. Nitric oxide is a sharp sweet-smelling gas at room temperature, whereas nitrogen dioxide has a strong, harsh odor and is a liquid at room temperature, becoming a reddish-brown gas above 70 °F. Nitrogen oxides do not build up in the food chain. [Boldface added] How can nitrogen oxides affect my health? Low levels of nitrogen oxides in the air can irritate your eyes, nose, throat, and lungs, possibly causing you to cough and experience shortness of breath, tiredness, and nausea.

The End Of Polar Bears By Tony Heller, His Blog, Nov 20, 2024 ARTICLES 1. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy: The DOGE Plan to Reform Government Following the Supreme Court’s guidance, we’ll reverse a decadeslong executive power grab. By Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, WSJ, Nov 20, 2024 TWTW Summary: the authors begin with: “Our nation was founded on the basic idea that the people we elect run the government. That isn’t how America functions today. Most legal edicts aren’t laws enacted by Congress, but ‘rules and regulations’ promulgated by unelected bureaucrats—tens of thousands of them each year. Most government enforcement decisions and discretionary expenditures aren’t made by the democratically elected president or even his political appointees but by millions of unelected, unappointed civil servants within government agencies who view themselves as immune from firing thanks to civil-service protections. This is antidemocratic and antithetical to the Founders’ vision. It imposes massive direct and indirect costs on taxpayers. Thankfully, we have a historic opportunity to solve the problem. On Nov. 5, voters decisively elected Donald Trump with a mandate for sweeping change, and they deserve to get it. President Trump has asked the two of us to lead a newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut the federal government down to size. The entrenched and ever-growing bureaucracy represents an existential threat to our republic, and politicians have abetted it for too long. That’s why we’re doing things differently. We are entrepreneurs, not politicians. We will serve as outside volunteers, not federal officials or employees. Unlike government commissions or advisory committees, we won’t just write reports or cut ribbons. We’ll cut costs. We are assisting the Trump transition team to identify and hire a lean team of small-government crusaders, including some of the sharpest technical and legal minds in America. This team will work in the new administration closely with the White House Office of Management and Budget. The two of us will advise DOGE at every step to pursue three major kinds of reform: regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions and cost savings. We will focus particularly on driving change through executive action based on existing legislation rather than by passing new laws. Our North Star for reform will be the U.S. Constitution, with a focus on two critical Supreme Court rulings issued during President Biden’s tenure. In West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency (2022), the justices held that agencies can’t impose regulations dealing with major economic or policy questions unless Congress specifically authorizes them to do so. In Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024), the court overturned the Chevron doctrine and held that federal courts should no longer defer to federal agencies’ interpretations of the law or their own rulemaking authority. Together, these cases suggest that a plethora of current federal regulations exceed the authority Congress has granted under the law. DOGE will work with legal experts embedded in government agencies, aided by advanced technology, to apply these rulings to federal regulations enacted by such agencies. DOGE will present this list of regulations to President Trump, who can, by executive action, immediately pause the enforcement of those regulations and initiate the process for review and rescission. This would liberate individuals and businesses from illicit regulations never passed by Congress and stimulate the U.S. economy. When the president nullifies thousands of such regulations, critics will allege executive overreach. In fact, it will be correcting the executive overreach of thousands of regulations promulgated by administrative fiat that were never authorized by Congress. The president owes lawmaking deference to Congress, not to bureaucrats deep within federal agencies. The use of executive orders to substitute for lawmaking by adding burdensome new rules is a constitutional affront, but the use of executive orders to roll back regulations that wrongly bypassed Congress is legitimate and necessary to comply with the Supreme Court’s recent mandates. And after those regulations are fully rescinded, a future president couldn’t simply flip the switch and revive them but would instead have to ask Congress to do so. A drastic reduction in federal regulations provides sound industrial logic for mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy. DOGE intends to work with embedded appointees in agencies to identify the minimum number of employees required at an agency for it to perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions. The number of federal employees to cut should be at least proportionate to the number of federal regulations that are nullified: Not only are fewer employees required to enforce fewer regulations, but the agency would produce fewer regulations once its scope of authority is properly limited. Employees whose positions are eliminated deserve to be treated with respect, and DOGE’s goal is to help support their transition into the private sector. The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit. Conventional wisdom holds that statutory civil-service protections stop the president or even his political appointees from firing federal workers. The purpose of these protections is to protect employees from political retaliation. But the statute allows for ‘reductions in force’ that don’t target specific employees. The statute further empowers the president to ‘prescribe rules governing the competitive service.’ That power is broad. Previous presidents have used it to amend the civil service rules by executive order, and the Supreme Court has held—in Franklin v. Massachusetts (1992) and Collins v. Yellen (2021) that they weren’t constrained by the Administrative Procedures Act when they did so. With this authority, Mr. Trump can implement any number of ‘rules governing the competitive service’ that would curtail administrative overgrowth, from large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area. Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home. Finally, we are focused on delivering cost savings for taxpayers. Skeptics question how much federal spending DOGE can tame through executive action alone. They point to the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, which stops the president from ceasing expenditures authorized by Congress. Mr. Trump has previously suggested this statute is unconstitutional, and we believe the current Supreme Court would likely side with him on this question. But even without relying on that view, DOGE will help end federal overspending by taking aim at the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended, from $535 million a year to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and $1.5 billion for grants to international organizations to nearly $300 million to progressive groups like Planned Parenthood. TWTW Comment: A promising start to a difficult task. Contrary to those who claim that in ending the Chevron Deference, judges will replace bureaucrats for expert judgement; it will be the lawmakers who will need to do so. That is where the Constitution places the authority and the requirement for such expertise. Congress will not be able to pass the buck on difficult decisions by deferring to bureaucrats. I hope that Microsoft’s nuclear power doesn’t crash or freeze like its software sometimes does. CTRL + ALT + DEL solves EVERYTHING. Biden administration committed to hiding “Renewable Energy” disaster approaching $750 million. https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/11/25/exclusive-crescent-dunes-biden-doj-moved-election-night-cover-up-alleged-solar-energy-scandal/ Login Become a WUWT Sponsor - click here Free signup if you want to post comments (includes ads) click here “Walk toward the fire.

Title: No Fianna Fáil 2011-type disaster for Sinn Féin but repeat of their 2020 success looks unlikely
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2024/11/26/no-fianna-fail-2011-type-disaster-for-sinn-fein-but-repeat-of-their-2020-success-looks-unlikely/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T02:00:00Z
Full Content:
During the local and European elections earlier this year, Sinn Féin canvassers in some of its heartlands area in Dublin were confronted with hostility on doorsteps. The flashpoint was immigration. Tents erected by asylum seekers were lined along the canal. Around the State, there were stand-offs with local residents over proposed accommodation centres. In Dublin, Sinn Féin was facing headwinds in some of its strongest areas, such as west Finglas, Coolock, Ballyfermot and the north inner city. At some doorsteps, the party’s candidates were called “traitors” and “unpatriotic”. In Coolock, a party member was attacked, sustaining a broken nose. Sinn Féin had a poor election. But then, it also had poor local and European elections in 2019 but bounced back spectacularly in the general election seven months later. This time, though, the journey back seemed more perilous. When supporters turn against a party it is never a pretty sight. For a while, it seemed this general election for Sinn Féin might be a minor version of what happened to Fianna Fáil in 2011 after the farcical collapse of its government. Back then, Fianna Fáil candidates faced similar anger from voters. Outgoing TD Mary Hanafin was standing at a school gate in Blackrock as one young parent guided her young child through the gates. “Hi, I am looking for your support,” said Hanafin pleasantly. “Fianna Fáil?” the woman asked. Before Hanafin could reply, she snarled: “I would rather stick pins in my eyes. You are a load of gangsters.” That was then, this is now. Following candidates from different parties across five Dublin constituencies this time, it’s clear it’s not going to be a 2011 for Sinn Féin. Soon after this summer’s elections, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald visited many key Dublin heartlands spoke to community leaders, in order to lance the boil. The party also did a volte face on its immigration policies. Since then, too, the issue has become less fraught and emotional. Two Sinn Féin TDs, Eoin Ó Broin and Mark Ward, are canvassing in Moorfield, a settled and attractive estate in north Clondalkin, where it usually pulls in 50 per cent of the vote. Ó Broin is an impressive operator on the ground. In another life, he would have made a great GP, with a mix of empathy and infinite patience for everybody he meets. “We would have estimated during the [summer election] about 10 per cent talked about migration and the accommodation issues,” he says. “A lot of those conversations were decent. People wanted to know what’s going on and were expressing concerns. There was a portion of exchanges which were hostile.” He said the issue is still being raised but not as often. “It’s perhaps the second or third issue. It does not have the same salience. At the time, it was soon after the riots and there were tents along the canal.” The cost of living, housing, tax and access to healthcare are also big issues. A young woman says her partner earns €50,000 and wants to know if there will be a change in tax bands as he feels the impact of cost-of-living hikes. Ó Broin explains the Sinn Féin plan to scrap the Universal Social Charge for anybody earning under €45,000. There is not enormous engagement. There are some pledged votes, some are non-committal. “We are still thinking,” one woman tells the Sinn Féin canvassers. “We really need a change,” Ó Broin urges her. “We are the only party that can do it.” There is only one hard “No”, an immediate door slam. In another house, a relatively young woman says she can’t vote for Sinn Féin because of “legacy issues”. Canvassing in Dún Laoghaire, the Green Party’s Ossian Smyth says that at this juncture in the campaign four years ago, the pension age issue championed by Sinn Féin had really taken hold and that people on doorsteps in all areas were talking about “change” and “Mary Lou”. “We are not hearing it this time,” he says. There is no doubt in Dublin the Greens are feeling the negative effects of being the small party in Government. On the other hand, there has been a defanging of voter toxicity around Labour and Fianna Fáil. In Tallaght, Fianna Fáil’s Teresa Costello is campaigning on the basis of her working-class roots and her understanding of the community. A cancer survivor and advocate, Costello is chatty and pleasant and gets positive engagement. She gets a few commitments of support but it’s striking how many people on the doorsteps have yet to commit. The bicycle shed invariably crops up. “For the name of Holy God, somebody get hold of the Office of Public Works and, for feck’s sake, tell them to stop spending money like it’s going out of fashion. There doesn’t seem to be any accountability,” a woman in Kingswood tells Costello. “The other thing is the national children’s hospital. Nobody called a halt to that.” One man tells her that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have been in power for too long. “It’s time to give Sinn Féin a twist,” he says. In Beaumont, Paul McAuliffe of Fianna Fáil chats to a manwhose daughter has just graduated as a teacher but who, owing to cost-of-living issues and the cost of houses, will find it hard to stay in Dublin. “Her friends in the [teaching] class are thinking of going to Australia. It’s all to do with the cost of living,” he says. McAuliffe points to the nearby new residential development of 800 homes on Oscar Traynor Road, saying the three-bedroom units will be available to some families at €360,000. The Labour candidate in Dublin South-West Ciarán Ahern is canvassing in Kimmage along with party leader Ivana Bacik. A couple in their 60s say they are worried about “so many people looking for social housing and being on the dole”. The man says: “I wasn’t handed a house. My kids weren’t handed their houses. When I hear people saying it’s a basic human right to have a house, and the Government should be building more houses for people, and it should be beside the mammy. I don’t agree with that.” Immigration is mentioned, but more sporadically than in the summer. “We have loads of immigrants coming in, and they lose their passports between getting off the plane and arriving. I think that they should be sent back to wherever they came from,” the man in Kimmage tells Ahern and Bacik. He says he has no trouble with people arriving who are willing to work in Ireland. They tell him Labour is the party of work and have proposals to ensure that all immigrants, including asylum seekers, can be allowed to work. But no one issue is yet dominating, as housing did in 2020. Nor does there seem to be any huge momentum behind any party. Perhaps we are looking at a scenario like the 2007 general election campaign, where after a fortnight of shadow boxing, everything was decided in the last week?

Nifty 50 seems to be struggling to get a strong follow-through buying. The bounce back move from the intraday low on Monday looks shallow. It also shows lack of strength.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average logged a record close on Monday, as U.S. Treasury bonds saw their biggest rally in nearly four months after President-elect Donald Trump selected Scott Bessent as his nominee for Treasury secretary. President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices on everything from gas to automobiles. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that on his first day in office he will impose a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The announcement sparked a dollar rally. It rose 1% against the Canadian dollar and 2% against the Mexican peso, while share markets in Asia fell, as did European equity futures ratcheting up concerns about his America First policies. Crude oil prices on Monday settled sharply lower on the back of speculation over a cease-fire in Lebanon, combined with what appears to be restraint on the part of Iran. U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to announce a ceasefire in Lebanon between armed group Hezbollah and Israel imminently, four senior Lebanese sources said on Monday. Asian shares were mostly lower on Tuesday on the back of Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on China, which could have an impact on other Asian economies. Nifty rose again on Nov 25 adding nearly 4% in two consecutive sessions of gains to regain its losses on a month-on-month basis. At close, Nifty was up 1.32% or 314.7 points at 24221.9. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates an upside breakout for the Nifty with an unfilled opening upside gap. If this gap remains unfilled for the next few sessions, it may mean formation of an important bottom reversal for Nifty around 23263 levels. In the near term 24500 could still pose some resistance for the Nifty while 23900 could offer support.

Title: Crypto firm Prometheum gained an edge under Gary Gensler’s SEC. Suddenly its future appears less certain

For years, the crypto industry has complained about the Securities and Exchange Commission’s hard-line stance, and its refusal to develop rules that account for blockchain’s distinct technology. One firm, though, claimed the SEC’s current crypto rules are just fine. This stance has paid off as the firm, Prometheum, won a first-of-its-kind license for crypto-based securities and—despite being virtually unknown in the crypto world—landed a prestigious slot in 2023 to testify about digital assets before Congress. But now Prometheum has a problem. The election of pro-crypto Donald Trump has led SEC Chair Gary Gensler to announce he will quit his position early next year. So now the firm—whose apparent inside track with the regulator appeared to give it an edge—must compete in a world where the rules of the crypto game are shifting dramatically. Most notably, there is an emerging consensus that many cryptocurrencies will not be considered securities when Trump is president. This is different from the current regulatory environment, where SEC’s Gensler has signaled that every token other than Bitcoin is a security, and filed lawsuits that have forced companies to delist popular tokens like Solana and XRP. Since the election, however, firms like Coinbase and Robinhood have re-listed those assets in anticipation of an incoming SEC chair who will not treat those tokens as securities. This is a potential problem for Prometheum since its business model has been based in large part on selling itself as a platform where crypto tokens are securities, and obtaining the legal infrastructure to support that. It’s unclear where this leaves Prometheum, which has attracted widespread derision from crypto figures over its role as Gensler’s model for the industry. Meanwhile, the firm faces an incoming Congress controlled by hostile Republicans, including figures like John Rose (R-Tenn.), who have accused it of having ties to China. Prometheum strongly denies that allegation. In response to questions from Fortune about Prometheum’s future in a post-Gensler world, the firm supplied written answers from Aaron Kaplan, who shares CEO duties with his brother. According to Kaplan, Prometheum has an opportunity to move beyond crypto and use its first-of-its-kind license (known as special purpose broker-dealer) to offer a wide variety of assets, including “equities, debt instruments, structured products, options, ETFs, money market funds” and more in the form of securities on a blockchain. “We expect that President Trump’s administration will oversee this market transformation as trillions of securities are issued on a blockchain, ushering in the benefits that blockchain technology has long promised market participants,” Kaplan wrote. Others are not so sure. Matt Walsh, cofounder of the influential crypto venture capital firm Castle Island who has been an outspoken critic of Prometheum, told Fortune he has seen little in the way of evidence that anyone is using the firm’s platform for real-world trading. And while financial giants like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, alongside crypto native firms like Superstate, are dabbling in tokenized traditional assets, this remains for now a very niche area of finance. In response to a question about whether Prometheum can point to real-world clients or other evidence of gaining traction in the market, Kaplan said the firm is still in “the very early stages” and that it is “actively engaged in discussions with financial institutions.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: From Bitcoin to Altcoins: Crypto Inflows Hit Record $3.1 Billion, Led by Spot ETFs
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/from-bitcoin-to-altcoins-crypto-inflows-hit-record-3-1-billion-led-by-spot-etfs/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T00:30:20Z

The crypto market witnessed a significant milestone last week as investment products recorded roughly $3.13 billion in net inflows globally, primarily driven by US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to data from CoinShares. This surge highlights growing institutional interest and confidence in the crypto market, with Bitcoin leading the charge. CoinShares reveals that the year-to-date net inflows into crypto funds have reached $37 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) soared to a new high of $153 billion. The recent inflows mark the seventh consecutive week of positive movements for global crypto investment products managed by leading firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and ProShares. A substantial portion of last week’s inflows, approximately $2.05 billion, originated from BlackRock’s IBIT product, underlining the dominance of US-based funds in the global space. These inflows outpaced the first-year debut of US gold ETFs, which attracted only $309 million. Bitcoin-based funds were at the forefront of the inflows, contributing $3 billion of the weekly total. This inflow coincided with Bitcoin’s continued price rally, drawing additional interest from institutional and retail investors. However, the higher prices also spurred a notable $10 million inflow into short-Bitcoin products, bringing the monthly figure for these products to $58 million — the highest since August 2022. While Bitcoin dominated, altcoins also attracted significant investment. Solana emerged as the second-most popular asset among institutional investors, with net weekly inflows of $16 million, surpassing Ethereum’s $2.8 million. Other altcoin-based funds also saw notable inflows, with XRP, Litecoin, and Chainlink attracting $15 million, $4.1 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. These inflows suggest growing confidence in the broader altcoin market, driven by price rallies and increasing adoption. US-based funds’ dominance was evident in regional fund flows, accounting for $3.2 billion in net weekly inflows. However, this was slightly “offset” by outflows from European markets, including $84 million, $40 million, and $17 million from crypto investment products in Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland, respectively. Despite these regional outflows, the overall trend remains bullish, driven largely by institutional participation in the US market. Notably, CoinShares’s continuous inflows reflect a combination of factors, including the market’s positive sentiment regarding the bull run and the increasing acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a pivotal development. It provides institutional investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to digital assets. As a result, the cryptocurrency market is witnessing a shift toward mainstream adoption, further supported by strong price performance and consistent inflows across various investment products.

Meet Samuel Edyme, Nickname - HIM-buktu. A web3 content writer, journalist, and aspiring trader, Edyme is as versatile as they come. With a knack for words and a nose for trends, he has penned pieces for numerous industry player, including AMBCrypto, Blockchain.News, and Blockchain Reporter, among others. Edyme’s foray into the crypto universe is nothing short of cinematic. His journey began not with a triumphant investment, but with a scam. Yes, a Ponzi scheme that used crypto as payment roped him in. Rather than retreating, he emerged wiser and more determined, channeling his experience into over three years of insightful market analysis. Before becoming the voice of reason in the crypto space, Edyme was the quintessential crypto degen. He aped into anything that promised a quick buck, anything ape-able, learning the ropes the hard way. These hands-on experience through major market events—like the Terra Luna crash, the wave of bankruptcies in crypto firms, the notorious FTX collapse, and even CZ’s arrest—has honed his keen sense of market dynamics. When he isn’t crafting engaging crypto content, you’ll find Edyme backtesting charts, studying both forex and synthetic indices. His dedication to mastering the art of trading is as relentless as his pursuit of the next big story. Away from his screens, he can be found in the gym, airpods in, working out and listening to his favorite artist, NF. Or maybe he’s catching some Z’s or scrolling through Elon Musk’s very own X platform—(oops, another screen activity, my bad…) Well, being an introvert, Edyme thrives in the digital realm, preferring online interaction over offline encounters—(don’t judge, that’s just how he is built). His determination is quite unwavering to be honest, and he embodies the philosophy of continuous improvement, or “kaizen,” striving to be 1% better every day. His mantras, “God knows best” and “Everything is still on track,” reflect his resilient outlook and how he lives his life. In a nutshell, Samuel Edyme was born efficient, driven by ambition, and perhaps a touch fierce. He’s neither artistic nor unrealistic, and certainly not chauvinistic. Think of him as Bruce Willis in a train wreck—unflappable. Edyme is like trading in your car for a jet—bold. He’s the guy who’d ask his boss for a pay cut just to prove a point—(uhhh…). He is like watching your kid take his first steps. Imagine Bill Gates struggling with rent—okay, maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the idea, yeah. Unbelievable? Yes. Inconceivable? Perhaps. Edyme sees himself as a fairly reasonable guy, albeit a bit stubborn. Normal to you is not to him. He is not the one to take the easy road, and why would he? That’s just not the way he roll. He has these favorite lyrics from NF’s “Clouds” that resonate deeply with him: “What you think's probably unfeasible, I've done already a hundredfold.” PS—Edyme is HIM. HIM-buktu. Him-mulation. Him-Kardashian. Himon and Pumba. He even had his DNA tested, and guess what? He’s 100% Him-alayan. Screw it, he ate the opp. Disclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

Title: Meta could outdo Google in the AI transformation, professor says

Despite being one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence research, Google (GOOGL+0.86%) isn’t poised to be a winner of the transformation, according to a business professor. “While Google may have blazed the trail in artificial intelligence, it’s Meta (META+1.47%) that’s poised to reap the rewards,” Howard Yu, LEGO Professor of Management and Innovation at IMD Business School, said in a written piece shared with Quartz. The reason according to Yu, who also leads the Center for Future Readiness, is about business models. “Google’s core business model — built on the elegance of simple search and link-clicking — is actually being undermined by AI,” Yu said, “while Meta’s advertising ecosystem is being supercharged by it.” For example, Meta’s AI-powered advertising system has been able to adapt after Apple’s (AAPL+0.91%) introduction of its App Tracking Transparency feature, Yu said, which requires iOS apps to request user permission to track activity. Before, advertisers could track how users bought a product after seeing an ad. The tech giant’s probabilistic models “are working better than the old tracking system ever did,” Yu said. Meta is also “erasing the line between content and advertising,” Yu said, by using AI to make items in images and videos on social media feeds purchasable. The company “isn’t just creating ad inventory — it’s turning everything into potential inventory. And Meta’s partnership with EssilorLuxottica (EL+0.23%) on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses gives it an AI-advantage that doesn’t threaten its business. Meanwhile, Google is struggling to integrate AI into its products without threatening its search business, Yu said, which “thrives on simplicity, directing users to click on links that generate ad revenue.” With AI chatbots that can provide direct answers to queries, users don’t have to visit web pages where ads are placed. And Google’s other AI features, such as NotebookLM, “don’t necessarily strengthen its primary revenue stream.” Meta was the third-highest tech company on the Center for Future Readiness’s Future Readiness Indicator after Nvidia (NVDA+0.64%) and Microsoft (MSFT+2.17%), due to its “aggressive investments in AI” that show “strong momentum, impacting nearly all aspects of its operations,” the report said. Google parent Alphabet was the fourth-highest tech company on the list. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 30% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world-leading GPU designer whose products are powering the artificial intelligence industry. Since the release of ChatGPT to the public, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have gained 730%, making it clear that AI is baked into the firm's hypothesis. The firm's fortunes depend on its ability to not only design the best-performing chips but also to sustainably and predictably ship them in high volumes to customers while keeping margins high. Consequently, any turbulence on either the product design, shipping, or cost control fronts leads to tailwinds for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares. Additionally, the high demand for its chips has meant that big tech is eager to find alternatives. The urgency for alternatives is also making companies design in-house AI chips, such as those from Amazon. As a result, unless NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) maintains its performance edge and logistics capabilities, the firm might see trouble in the future. Polen Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "In a reversal from the past two quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market’s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock’s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (“GenAI”) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.” Overall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 20% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the leading social media company in the world. The firm operates through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and courtesy of Facebook, it can boast about having 3.2 billion users under its wing. These users also form the backbone of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis as they allow the firm to have bargaining power with advertisers. Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations. Polen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.” Overall META ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 20% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the leading social media company in the world. The firm operates through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and courtesy of Facebook, it can boast about having 3.2 billion users under its wing. These users also form the backbone of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis as they allow the firm to have bargaining power with advertisers. Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations. Polen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.” Overall META ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Envestnet Finalizes $4.5 Billion Go-Private Deal With Bain Capital

Wealth technology provider Envestnet has officially become a private company. The firm announced Monday (Nov. 25) that it had closed its acquisition by affiliates of vehicles managed or advised by Bain Capital, a deal worth roughly $4.5 billion. “This represents an exciting new chapter in Envestnet’s history, paving the way for accelerated growth and building on our position as a leading wealth management platform in the industry,” Jim Fox, Envestnet’s board chair and interim CEO, said in a news release. Added Tom Sipp, Envestnet’s executive vice president: “Together with Bain Capital, Envestnet will continue to deliver on its mission, empowering firms and advisors with the wealth technology and solutions to holistically serve their clients.” The company had announced its plans to go private in July. Also taking part in the deal were Reverence Capital and Norwest, along with BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Franklin Templeton and State Street Global Advisors. According to the release, Envestnet has $6.5 trillion in platform assets, more than 20 million accounts and serves more than 111,000 financial advisors. The company’s technology, advanced insights and comprehensive solutions are designed to help financial advisors improve business growth, productivity and provide better client outcomes. In other news from the financial advice world, PYMNTS spoke last month with Doug Brown, chief product officer, digital banking at Candescent, about the pressures consumers feel in seeking such advice, with many plagued by a fear of missteps. “The best partner is in fact the local community bank who understands them and their environment better than most,” Brown told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. “There’s been a lot of outreach from both banks and others trying to inform, but what they’re probably doing is creating a little bit more panic than rational help. That’s why consumers are seeking a company they can trust to guide through this.” Credit unions and smaller banks “want to be top of mind with the small businesses and the consumers in the communities they serve,” Brown added. These financial institutions, which have existing relationships with consumers, should be natural financial advisors. But research by PYMNTS Intelligence and NCR Voyix (as Candescent was once known) found that only 57% of customers looked to their banks for financial advice last year. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

(see more details here). A group of finance professionals analyzing market trends on their computer screens. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 21% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) is an enterprise-focused software company that provides human resource and financial management software. This exposes the firm to the labor market as HR software typically does well when firms have adequate hiring budgets in a relaxed monetary environment. Consequently, with interest rates in the US just recently coming off of a 24-year high, it's unsurprising that Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY)'s shares are down 4% year-to-date. However, the pent-up potential in the stock due to monetary constraints is also evident through the fact that since the November presidential election, the shares have gained 6.70%. Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) has struggled particularly hard due to increasing costs as it posted operating losses each year between 2021 and 2023. However, improved financial performance can carry significant tailwinds, as was evident following Q2 results when the stock jumped by 12.5% after Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY)'s $2.085 billion revenue and $1.75 in EPS beat analyst estimates of $2.071 billion and $1.65. Polen Capital mentioned Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "We added to several existing positions in the quarter including Adobe, Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), Shopify, MSCI, and Paycom Software. Workday is still growing revenue at a mid-to-high-teens rate, but in recent years, slower macroeconomic growth has made closing deals more challenging. Amidst a pullback, we increased our position as we found the valuation attractive for a well-positioned, recurring revenue business with still strong growth potential. The company also recently stated publicly that it will be focused on expanding profit margins meaningfully over the next five years—something we have expected and are pleased to see.” Overall WDAY ranks 10th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of WDAY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WDAY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

These developments have led Axon to raise its Q4 revenue guidance to $560-570 million and project a full-year revenue exceeding $2.07 billion. Despite some sequential margin decline expected in Q4 due to integration costs, Axon maintains a confident outlook. The company anticipates maintaining a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2025 and is on track to meet its 2025 revenue target one year early.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Talks Up Cooperation With China Ahead of Trump Trade War 2.0

Despite widespread fears that President-elect Donald Trump’s return to office will lead to tightened trade policies around A.I. chips to curb China’s tech advances, the CEO of Nvidia (NVDA), the largest manufacturer of A.I. chips, is still optimistic about the state of America’s relationship with China under the incoming administration. “Open research is one of the miracles of modern science and perhaps the ultimate form of global cooperation—one that we must protect,” Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang on Saturday (Nov. 23) while accepting an honorary doctorate from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Huang, who lauded the region’s contributions towards technology like A.I., later told reporters that, while he doesn’t “know what’s going to happen with the new administration,” Nvidia will continue to balance policy and law compliance with innovative tech development.

You can opt out anytime. Nvidia’s booming GPU business has made it one of the world’s most valuable public companies, with a market cap of $3.38 trillion. However, like other chipmakers, its footprint in China has been shrinking in recent years amid growing geopolitical tensions and tightened export policies. Nvidia’s sales in China accounted for around 15 percent of its total revenue in the quarter ended September, a drop from 26 percent two years ago. In a continued effort under Trump’s first presidential term, the Biden administration in 2022 restricted Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips to China (including Hong Kong). Trump, who is poised to expand such measures, has also said he will enact tariffs in Taiwan, home to Nvidia’s largest supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). While supporting measured China policies, Huang lauded China’s “significant contributions to open science research helping to advance A.I. worldwide.” Over the years, Nvidia has benefitted from its presence in areas like Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, according to the CEO. “From the beginning, we’ve had the benefit and the great joy and privilege of watching the amazing tech industry form in China,” he said. As Huang received his honorary doctorate from HKUST, he highlighted the fact that the school’s alumni have helped found more than 1,800 startups that are still in operation today. “I’m thrilled to see so much energy focused on advancing the science of A.I. as well as using A.I. to advance at HKUST and across all of China,” he said. Thanks to developments across the new technology, “the greatest challenges of our time—unimaginable challenges to overcome in the past—all of a sudden seem possible to tackle,” he added. Earlier this month, Huang said that Nvidia will comply with whichever policies the Trump administration decides upon. “We’ll of course support the administration,” said Huang during an earnings call, adding Nvidia will also simultaneously continue to support its customers and compete in the marketplace.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time For years, bitcoin won by being boring. Investors weren’t able to do all that much with it besides buy and hold it. But that was precisely why the world’s largest cryptocurrency was valuable. It was a commodity, like gold — or corn. It didn’t get too fancy on its offerings. In fact, bitcoin’s core team of developers has intentionally moved as slowly as possible on everything that touches the base blockchain specifically to avoid breaking things. That’s why many of crypto’s more cavalier coders headed to other blockchains to tinker and do things like build decentralized applications. The approach worked. Traders poured their money into bitcoin not just because it was the OG coin but also because the network was robust and reliable, and they knew what they were getting. As solana reported hack after hack, bitcoin didn’t really change. The asset was volatile, but aside from a major system upgrade that took four years to design and green-light, bitcoin kept its status as the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market cap by sticking to the status quo. But times are changing for the original coin. Developers are increasingly building on bitcoin’s base blockchain in unexpected ways. Wall Street is also decking the coin out with all its familiar trappings such as exchange-traded fund wrappers and allowing traders to hedge positions and make leveraged bets. In January, spot bitcoin ETFs began trading, which opened the door to more mainstream investors. Last week, options on those spot crypto products finally started to go live on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. CBOE Global Markets is also set to list its first cash-settled bitcoin ETF options Dec. 2. Creating this new margin framework around bitcoin means that both retail traders and institutions alike will be able to get more exposure to the asset class relative to how much cash they’re investing. Collectively, the U.S.-issued spot bitcoin funds hold north of $100 billion in assets under management. Last week, they notched their largest weekly inflows on record, totaling more than $3.1 billion. And according to CoinShares, year-to-date net flows are up to $37 billion versus U.S. Gold ETFs, which drew around $309 million in their first year. Nearly half of those flows into the spot bitcoin products took place after U.S. interest rates were cut for the first time in four years in September. Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, told CNBC there has been record high open interest for futures on the CME derivatives exchange, the way most U.S. institutions currently buy bitcoin futures contracts. But a lot of traders have been waiting for options on spot bitcoin ETFs on major exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq, since it enhances liquidity and offers hedging tools. Lunde says that demand for leveraged long exposure to bitcoin and ether is climbing, with VolatilityShares’ BTC exposure hitting new all-time highs. Galaxy Digital’s trading team told CNBC the firm has observed significant volume in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF options, the first to launch on the Nasdaq last week. BlackRock is the largest digital asset manager in the world after it eclipsed Grayscale in August. BlackRock’s bitcoin trust IBIT holds $48.4 billion in bitcoin compared with the $34 billion in its gold trust. Options on IBIT had a blockbuster debut, with 353,716 contracts traded on its first day, according to Galaxy Digital. The firm noted that the previous most active debut of options trading was when Facebook options went live in 2012 and 360,000 contracts changed hands. Galaxy sees notable trading activity extending out to January 2027, roughly halfway into Donald Trump’s administration. On the campaign trail, the president-elect had an about-face on bitcoin and went from criticizing digital assets to making big promises to the crypto industry. Bitcoin is up roughly 40% since Election Day, Nov. 5. “This level of concentrated, long-dated activity reflects investor confidence in the ETF’s long-term growth potential, signaling bullish sentiment for the years ahead,” Galaxy’s trading team told CNBC. Until now, offshore crypto native platforms such as Binance and Deribit have been the main marketplace for bitcoin derivatives trading. Galaxy told CNBC there is a noticeable volatility premium between Deribit, CME and IBIT, which could present arbitrage opportunities among the varying platforms offering derivatives trading. On Friday, more than $9 billion in bitcoin options contracts expire on Deribit, which could lead to greater price volatility as the expiration date approaches. “There’s a ton of leverage in the system right now,” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, a longtime crypto investor, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Friday. “You look at the funding rates to do crypto in our market, right? The perpetual market, as high as they’ve been, the basis is high,” Novogratz said. “The crypto community is levered to the gills, and so there will be a correction.” Bitcoin was within striking distance of $100,000 on Friday but retrenched over the weekend. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $95,000. MacKenzie Sigalos is a technology reporter for CNBC with a focus on cryptocurrency and fintech. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rose on Monday as small caps rallied near new highs and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 400 points amid a broad sense of optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. The Dow increased 0.9% to close at a new record. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.3%, despite Nvidia (NVDA) sliding over 4%. The Russell 2000 (^RUT), up 1.6%, also closed a whisker off a record high. It did notch an intraday high. Stocks kicked off a holiday-shortened week with more of the upbeat mood that lifted the gauges to weekly wins. Markets will shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and close early on Friday. Trump tapped Bessent, viewed as the "investor favorite" pick for Treasury, late Friday evening after a surprisingly drawn-out process that saw candidates' stocks seem to rise and fall by the day. Bessent's nomination has seemed to at least temporarily calm nerves over the president-elect's inflationary agenda, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dipping back under 4.3%. On the inflationary front, the Fed will get its preferred look at the picture heading into Trump's term with Wednesday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. Economists expect a tick up in "core" PCE, which is closely watched by the central bank. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) was in search of a milestone $100,000-per-coin level amid a near-50% surge over the past month. It was back down below $95,000 on Monday, however. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Stocks rose on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closing at a fresh record after gaining more than 400 points, or nearly 1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also gained 0.3%, weighed by shares of Nvidia (NVDA) sliding over 4%. Meanwhile small cap stocks also rallied with the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gaining as much as 2% during the session to hit record intraday highs. The index closed just shy of its all-time high record. The markets rose on Monday following President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Kamlani reports: Allurion (ALUR) launched a new program to provide patients access to compounded weight-loss drugs Monday after months of pitching its own weight-loss solution — an ingestible balloon — as an alternative for patients who may not want to use the popular injectable GLP-1 drugs. Allurion CEO Shantanu Gaur told Yahoo Finance that, like others, the company continues to see a spillover effect from the unprecedented interest in GLP-1 drugs like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound. It's why the company is now offering copycat products at a fraction of the cost. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Tesla stock (TSLA) is down Monday following a strong recent run-up as one Wall Street bank says “animal spirits” have pushed the stock beyond any “fundamental change” at the company. Joseph Spak at UBS noted that Tesla stock has surged around 40% since the election, adding over $350 million to its market cap. While some of President-elect Donald Trump's policy proposals could favor Tesla, there are some policy negatives as well that would hurt fundamentals more than where the theoretical upside has taken the stock. “The rise in Tesla stock is mostly driven by animal spirits/momentum (which has happened multiple times in TSLA’s history),” Spak wrote. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) sank on Monday to $95,000 after recently jumping to record highs just a stone's throw away from $100,000. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady climb since the Donald Trump's presidential victory earlier this month. On Friday the token inched above $99,600. Year-to-date bitcoin is up about 120%. Cruise line stocks have had an impressive run this year, and there’s still more room for growth, according to Bank of America. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) and Carnival Corporation (CCL) have climbed more than 30% while Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is up over 80% year-to-date. Bank of America raised Norwegian's price target to $29 from $26 and kept a Neutral rating. For Carnival, the firm raised the price target to $28 from $24 and kept a Buy rating, while for Royal Caribbean, analysts raised the price target to $240 from $210 and kept a Neutral rating. “The travel industry is back,” Bank of America analyst Andrew Didora told Yahoo Finance. “It just seems like the core demographic here for cruise [lines], which is typically a bit higher income, they continue to be in a good spot from a discretionary spending perspective.” Cruise-line operators have seen a resurgence in demand as interest rebounded from the pandemic-era, when the restrictions kept fleets docked. Data from Bank of America shows that monthly cruise spending increased 8% in October on a yearly basis. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped to session lows, sinking more than 3% on Monday. The AI chip heavyweight was the worst performer among the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell more than 1% while Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) rose more than 1%. Nvidia's slide weighed on the Nasdaq, which briefly turned negative by 12:20 p.m. ET. Netflix (NFLX) shares also slid 3%, keeping a lid on the tech-heavy index. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) rose more than 2% on Monday to hit its highest level since November 2021. The small cap index has rallied in recent months as the Fed began its interest rate cutting cycle, fueling expectations of less expensive financing. The Russell 2000 is up more than 20% year-to-date, with much of those gains occurring since early August. Two more Wall Street strategists are projecting the bull market in US stocks will roll on in 2025. On Monday, equity strategy teams at Barclays and RBC Capital Markets both issued a year-end target price of 6,600 for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2025. The targets suggest a roughly 10.5% gain in the benchmark index over the next twelve months, about in line with the long-term historical average annual return over the past century. "The story the data tells us is that another year of solid economic and earnings growth, some political tailwinds, and some additional relief on inflation (which should keep the S&P 500’s P/E elevated) can keep stocks moving higher in the year ahead," RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, wrote that with "inflation continuing to normalize, resilient macro, and Big Tech maintaining EPS growth leadership," the S&P 500 should continue its march higher.

MicroStrategy stock recovered from a loss of more than 7% in early trading. In a filing with the SEC, MicroStrategy said it spent $5.4 billion to acquire these bitcoin between Nov. 18-24, buying the bitcoin at an average price of $97,862. The company said it used proceeds from convertible notes and share sales to fund the purchase. The application software company, which has become a bitcoin proxy, has been buying tokens since 2020. In recent weeks, it has intensified its purchases as bitcoin has rallied to highs above $99,000 following Donald Trump's presidential win earlier this month. As of Sunday, MicroStrategy held a total of approximately 386,700 bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate purchase price of about $21.9 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $56,761 per bitcoin. Oil dropped to session lows on a report that a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah may have been reached. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) sank more than 2% to hover below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded below $74 per barrel. Axios reported on Monday that Israel and Lebanon have agreed to terms of a ceasefire, citing a senior US official. Earlier, the Israeli ambassador to Washington said in a radio interview on Monday that deal points still need to be finalized but an agreement "can happen within days.” Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped as much as 3% in early trading as the AI chip heavyweight failed to participate in the rest of the market gains. Nvidia shares extended their decline from Friday's session, despite the company beating on quarterly results announced last week. The AI chipmaker has been a leader in the overall markets this year, accounting for roughly 20% of the S&P 500's performance. US stocks rose on Monday as investors await the Fed's preferred measure of inflation this week and after President-elect Donald Trump announced his pick for Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the advance, up roughly 0.7%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while those the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up almost 0.6%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index will be released this Wednesday, giving investors clues on what the Fed's next move with interest rates may be.

Data from Bank of America shows that monthly cruise spending increased 8% in October on a yearly basis. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped to session lows, sinking more than 3% on Monday. The AI chip heavyweight was the worst performer among the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell more than 1% while Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) rose more than 1%. Nvidia's slide weighed on the Nasdaq, which briefly turned negative by 12:20 p.m. ET. Netflix (NFLX) shares also slid 3%, keeping a lid on the tech-heavy index. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) rose more than 2% on Monday to hit its highest level since November 2021. The small cap index has rallied in recent months as the Fed began its interest rate cutting cycle, fueling expectations of less expensive financing. The Russell 2000 is up more than 20% year-to-date, with much of those gains occurring since early August. Two more Wall Street strategists are projecting the bull market in US stocks will roll on in 2025. On Monday, equity strategy teams at Barclays and RBC Capital Markets both issued a year-end target price of 6,600 for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2025. The targets suggest a roughly 10.5% gain in the benchmark index over the next twelve months, about in line with the long-term historical average annual return over the past century. "The story the data tells us is that another year of solid economic and earnings growth, some political tailwinds, and some additional relief on inflation (which should keep the S&P 500’s P/E elevated) can keep stocks moving higher in the year ahead," RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, wrote that with "inflation continuing to normalize, resilient macro, and Big Tech maintaining EPS growth leadership," the S&P 500 should continue its march higher.

MicroStrategy stock recovered from a loss of more than 7% in early trading. In a filing with the SEC, MicroStrategy said it spent $5.4 billion to acquire these bitcoin between Nov. 18-24, buying the bitcoin at an average price of $97,862. The company said it used proceeds from convertible notes and share sales to fund the purchase. The application software company, which has become a bitcoin proxy, has been buying tokens since 2020. In recent weeks, it has intensified its purchases as bitcoin has rallied to highs above $99,000 following Donald Trump's presidential win earlier this month. As of Sunday, MicroStrategy held a total of approximately 386,700 bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate purchase price of about $21.9 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $56,761 per bitcoin. Oil dropped to session lows on a report that a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah may have been reached. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) sank more than 2% to hover below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded below $74 per barrel. Axios reported on Monday that Israel and Lebanon have agreed to terms of a ceasefire, citing a senior US official. Earlier, the Israeli ambassador to Washington said in a radio interview on Monday that deal points still need to be finalized but an agreement "can happen within days.” Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped as much as 3% in early trading as the AI chip heavyweight failed to participate in the rest of the market gains. Nvidia shares extended their decline from Friday's session, despite the company beating on quarterly results announced last week. The AI chipmaker has been a leader in the overall markets this year, accounting for roughly 20% of the S&P 500's performance. US stocks rose on Monday as investors await the Fed's preferred measure of inflation this week and after President-elect Donald Trump announced his pick for Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the advance, up roughly 0.7%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while those the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up almost 0.6%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index will be released this Wednesday, giving investors clues on what the Fed's next move with interest rates may be.

Title: O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (ORLY): Resilient Growth Amid Consumer Challenges and Counter-Cyclical Strengths

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A mechanic working on a car in an auto shop, skillfully replacing the aftermarket parts. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 12% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52 O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) is an American car parts retailer headquartered in Missouri. The firm sells new and refurbished parts through its stores. It's another stock that has been hit hard by the weak consumer spending environment in the US. Ahead of the November election, O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)'s shares had gained a modest 23% as consumer demand has remained muted. However, the firm benefits from a diversified income statement that depends on consumers and repair shops. The latter business has helped O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) avoid a sharper stock price downturn. This is because during H1 2024, while the firm's consumer revenue grew by 2.5%, the revenue from parts sold to shops grew by 8.5%. Additionally, there might be pent-up potential built up in the stock that can be released due to robust economic activity. This potential was hinted at when O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)'s shares gained 6% after the election and are up by 4.3% since then. ClearBridge Investments mentioned O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Skepticism over the consumer has left some high-quality stocks with depressed valuations and allowed us to reduce our consumer discretionary underweight with the addition of O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) and Starbucks. While we have been cautious on retailers for quite some time, auto parts retailer O’Reilly is a best-in-class, high-quality operator with high returns on invested capital and a solid history of consistent execution and sustainable share gain, and it enjoys rational competitive dynamics in the broader industry. In addition, auto parts retailing carries some counter-cyclicality as consumers tend to hold on to their cars longer, requiring more repair and maintenance, during softer economic environments. We think a high-quality franchise like O’Reilly trading at a reasonable valuation in an otherwise expensive market is worth our attention and we initiated a starter position.” Overall ORLY ranks 22nd on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of ORLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The firm's self-owned stores which it operates under the Planet Fitness brand are its largest source of revenue. These stores accounted for 45% of Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)'s revenue during H1 2024, and they were followed by franchise revenue which accounted for 31% of the firm's sales. Consequently, consumer spending on fitness and Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)'s ability to increase its memberships along with stable operations are the keys to the firm's hypothesis. The firm also depends on the ability to open new stores, which has been constrained lately due to the slowdown in the real estate industry because of high interest rates. Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) is currently seeking to grow revenue by increasing its Classic membership fees, as it hopes to attract more consumers after witnessing growth in the premium Black membership segment. Consequently, membership growth and store expansion can lead to tailwinds or headwinds for the shares. During the Q3 2024 earnings call, Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)'s management shared how retail store closures can play into its store expansion plans. Here is what they said: "We – I read a recent study that said there were about 5,300 closures last year and there will be north of 6,000 closures this year. And we do see that as an opportunity for Planet Fitness and to work in partnership with our franchisees. Our real estate team is engaged with brokers on a very regular basis to have line of sight to where space maybe becoming available and then partnering with our franchisees on that availability where there’s an opportunity to develop a new club. So I think you’re spot on. And we’re seeing the same trends. We know that’s market specific. It’s not in every market, but there’s a lot of space coming online. Overall PLNT ranks 23rd on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of PLNT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLNT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Microsoft's Death Cross: Tech Giant Faces A Double Blow With FTC Pressure

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), the heavyweight of Big Tech, has hit a grim milestone in technical analysis: a Death Cross. With its share price slipping below key moving averages, MSFT stock has moved into bearish territory, casting doubts on its near-term prospects. Is this just a blip for the software giant, or the prelude to deeper woes? Chart created using Benzinga Pro At $418.19, MSFT stock price trails its 20-day, 50-day and even the 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). Technical indicators are sounding alarms: The 20-day SMA at $418.73, the 50-day SMA at $421.65 and the 200-day SMA at $421.81 all point to a bearish signal. The eight-day SMA at $417.37, continues to be driven by bullish sentiment over the short term, driven by buying pressure. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) stands at -1.11, another red flag. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 49.09 suggests that Microsoft isn't oversold yet but is heading toward bearish momentum. These technical markers paint a strongly bearish picture. Yet, buying pressure persists, indicating that investors still see potential for a turnaround—a glimmer of bullish hope amidst the gloom. Read Also: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. Compounding Microsoft's technical woes is a ProPublica investigation that has raised ethical and legal concerns over the company’s federal contracting practices. As detailed in the report, Microsoft's "White House Offer"—a supposedly altruistic pledge to bolster government cybersecurity—was a calculated business maneuver. The plan involved providing free upgrades and consulting services to federal agencies, locking them into Microsoft's ecosystem. Once the "free" period ended, agencies had little choice but to continue with costly subscriptions and Azure services, effectively squeezing out competitors. This strategy not only strengthened Microsoft's grip on federal business but also invited scrutiny for potentially violating federal procurement and antitrust laws. Legal experts argue that the deal sidesteps open competition, raising concerns about its long-term implications for government reliance on a single vendor. While the technical indicators signal bearishness, the buying pressure suggests a tug-of-war between short-term skepticism and long-term optimism. Microsoft's market dominance—bolstered by its lucrative cloud business and strategic maneuvers—remains a formidable moat. However, the ethical controversies surrounding its federal contracts could dent investor confidence and invite regulatory headwinds. Microsoft's Death Cross is a wake-up call for investors. With the stock under technical pressure and the ProPublica revelations casting a shadow over its business practices, the path forward is murky. Bulls might see this as a chance to buy on weakness, banking on Microsoft's resilience. Bears, however, have a compelling case to remain cautious as the stock navigates this precarious juncture. For now, Microsoft's crossroads is a reminder that even the mightiest of tech giants are not immune to scrutiny—or the market's harsh judgment.

Investors weren't able to do all that much with it besides buy and hold it. But that was precisely why the world's largest cryptocurrency was valuable. It was a commodity, like gold — or corn. It didn't get too fancy on its offerings. In fact, bitcoin's core team of developers has intentionally moved as slowly as possible on everything that touches the base blockchain specifically to avoid breaking things. That's why many of crypto's more cavalier coders headed to other blockchains to tinker and do things like build decentralized applications. The approach worked. Traders poured their money into bitcoin not just because it was the OG coin but also because the network was robust and reliable, and they knew what they were getting. As solana reported hack after hack, bitcoin didn't really change. The asset was volatile, but aside from a major system upgrade that took four years to design and green-light, bitcoin kept its status as the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market cap by sticking to the status quo. But times are changing for the original coin. Developers are increasingly building on bitcoin's base blockchain in unexpected ways. Wall Street is also decking the coin out with all its familiar trappings such as exchange-traded fund wrappers and allowing traders to hedge positions and make leveraged bets. In January, spot bitcoin ETFs began trading, which opened the door to more mainstream investors. Last week, options on those spot crypto products finally started to go live on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. CBOE Global Markets is also set to list its first cash-settled bitcoin ETF options Dec. 2. Creating this new margin framework around bitcoin means that both retail traders and institutions alike will be able to get more exposure to the asset class relative to how much cash they're investing. Collectively, the U.S.-issued spot bitcoin funds hold north of $100 billion in assets under management. Last week, they notched their largest weekly inflows on record, totaling more than $3.1 billion. And according to CoinShares, year-to-date net flows are up to $37 billion versus U.S. Gold ETFs, which drew around $309 million in their first year. Nearly half of those flows into the spot bitcoin products took place after U.S. interest rates were cut for the first time in four years in September. Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, told CNBC there has been record high open interest for futures on the CME derivatives exchange, the way most U.S. institutions currently buy bitcoin futures contracts. But a lot of traders have been waiting for options on spot bitcoin ETFs on major exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq, since it enhances liquidity and offers hedging tools. Lunde says that demand for leveraged long exposure to bitcoin and ether is climbing, with VolatilityShares' BTC exposure hitting new all-time highs. Galaxy Digital's trading team told CNBC the firm has observed significant volume in BlackRock's IBIT ETF options, the first to launch on the Nasdaq last week. BlackRock is the largest digital asset manager in the world after it eclipsed Grayscale in August. BlackRock's bitcoin trust IBIT holds $48.4 billion in bitcoin compared with the $34 billion in its gold trust. Options on IBIT had a blockbuster debut, with 353,716 contracts traded on its first day, according to Galaxy Digital. The firm noted that the previous most active debut of options trading was when Facebook options went live in 2012 and 360,000 contracts changed hands. Galaxy sees notable trading activity extending out to January 2027, roughly halfway into Donald Trump's administration. On the campaign trail, the president-elect had an about-face on bitcoin and went from criticizing digital assets to making big promises to the crypto industry. Bitcoin is up roughly 40% since Election Day, Nov. 5. "This level of concentrated, long-dated activity reflects investor confidence in the ETF's long-term growth potential, signaling bullish sentiment for the years ahead," Galaxy's trading team told CNBC. Until now, offshore crypto native platforms such as Binance and Deribit have been the main marketplace for bitcoin derivatives trading. Galaxy told CNBC there is a noticeable volatility premium between Deribit, CME and IBIT, which could present arbitrage opportunities among the varying platforms offering derivatives trading. On Friday, more than $9 billion in bitcoin options contracts expire on Deribit, which could lead to greater price volatility as the expiration date approaches. "There's a ton of leverage in the system right now," Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, a longtime crypto investor, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday. "You look at the funding rates to do crypto in our market, right? The perpetual market, as high as they've been, the basis is high," Novogratz said. "The crypto community is levered to the gills, and so there will be a correction." Bitcoin was within striking distance of $100,000 on Friday but retrenched over the weekend. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $95,000. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

A historic rally fueled by Trump’s crypto agenda pushes bitcoin to new heights. This is a published version of our weekly Forbes Crypto Confidential newsletter. Sign up here to get Crypto Confidential days earlier free in your inbox. Bitcoin temporarily rose above $99,000 last week. Crypto isn’t just back. It’s booming. Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $99,456.01 on November 22. Major altcoins are rallying too: Solana (SOL) touched $262.93, surpassing its 2021 peak. Behind the surge: The bull run signals rising confidence in crypto’s mainstreaming—and in the market’s belief that Trump’s pro-crypto rhetoric could deliver. When crypto prices spike, so does the risk of theft. Ledger, the Paris-based crypto security firm, is thriving in the chaos. Its flagship hardware wallets, which protect the private keys unlocking digital assets, are selling at unprecedented rates—3x increase in hardware sales during bitcoin’s rally from $68,000 to $98,000 and 3.5x surge in transactions on Ledger Live, its companion app. CEO Pascal Gauthier has grander ambitions: positioning Ledger as a cornerstone of the digital era. In his vision, its devices will be as essential to your online life as a passport is to global travel. Read more. Sources: Forbes Digital Assets, CoinGecko. Prices as of 5:25 p.m. on November 22, 2024. Bitcoin is knocking on $100K’s door, with the market up 90% year to date. But who holds the biggest fortune? Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, recently freed from prison, leads Forbes’ crypto rich list with $61.6 billion. But the real wealth story is Bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. At current prices, Satoshi’s estimated holdings—600,000 to 1.1 million BTC—could be worth $106 billion, enough to surpass Bill Gates ($104.9 billion) and claim the 15th spot on the global billionaire rankings. Yet Satoshi’s identity, like his holdings, remains shrouded in mystery.

Title: These Are The Best Black Friday New-Vehicle Rebate And Financing Deals

The full-electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck is being offered with up to $5,000 cash back and ... [+] with a free home changing unit and installation. Though it originated with fighting crowds swarming to score deep discounts on big-screen TVs and the latest must-have toys, the so-called Black Friday weekend has since become one of the best times of the year to buy a new car, with automakers kicking off their annual holiday savings events. The deals look to be especially rich and plentiful this time around, especially for those willing to take their pick of leftover cars and trucks from the 2024 model year. Many of them are carrying especially lucrative cash-back and zero-percent financing incentives from the manufacturers to help dealers winnow down their existing stock. We’re listing the best deals we could find below. Many of the richest rebate offers are on electric vehicles from the 2024 model year that remain in stock, with several automakers offering $7,500 cash back to compensate on models that do not otherwise qualify for the one-time $7,500 federal tax credit. Of note, Ford is currently offering a complimentary home charger and installation, in addition to the incentives listed below, on the F-150 Lightning full-size electric pickup truck and the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV. We’re noting the vehicles offering cash rebates of $3,000 or more and/or 0.0% financing through automakers’ captive finance divisions for four-year or longer terms; several other models are likewise offering 0.0% loans, but only for three-year loan lengths. Always run the numbers when facing a choice between a cash rebate and cut-rate financing, relative to the lowest new-car loan rates from local lenders or your credit union, to see which is the better deal. Some automakers’ offers are regional in nature, usually to address local supply and demand issues. For example, we found a $10,000 cash rebate on the full-size Lincoln Navigator SUV being promoted in the Southern California area. The terms we’re quoting below are those being extended nationwide or at least in various regions as far as we can tell, and are valid through Thanksgiving weekend. Note that cut-rate financing programs are generally restricted to those having stellar credit scores and qualifying incomes. Expect local dealerships to get in the act with their own Black Friday promotions to help lure consumers already in a spending mood into their showrooms. However, expect the most generous incentives and/or deepest discounts to be limited to the slowest sellers on the lot, and especially on any remaining 2024 model-year inventory, while current models may offer less-generous deals, if at all. Note that other cash rebates or financing incentives may be available to recent college graduates, first responders, members of the military and other groups; some are offered to current brand owners or those from competing automakers; others are sometimes extended to those having qualifying trade-ins. Check contact automakers’ websites or area dealerships for details on what’s being offered locally. As always, keep in mind that cash rebates come directly from the automaker. For their part, dealers should also be willing to slash their markups to help clear their existing inventories on any of the models we’re highlighting These are often enabled with the assistance of what are often called “secret rebates” made direct to dealerships. Be sure to negotiate the transaction price separately from any cash rebate that may apply and shop around for the best bottom-line deal. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: BIG BIT THOUGHTS.

Time Published: 2024-11-25T19:27:51Z

Video podcast Audio I don’t think I know any human being on the planet who doesn’t want to be rich, or tries to increase their worth their net worth etc. Doesn’t matter if you’re an investor, work for a charity, a church etc. Money and capital are critical, it is like our economic life blood. For example, maybe you should think about blood. Blood is a critical and essential. Nobody could survive or thrive without blood. Now imagine… That somebody is taking your help four-year-old child, in drawing a pint of blood from them a day. What is going to happen to the health of your kid? It will severely stunt his growth, or positively kill him. Another thing… Imagine like you’re eating only rancid food your whole life, and the theory, you’re not going to die from it, but… Ain’t nobody want to eat rancid food. Or, let us assume that you’re consuming certain foods to just keep you alive, like beans, but everyone knows that beans cause flatulence, even an ancient Roman times, and technically raw beans are toxic. Lagoons, naturally do not want to be eaten or consumed. And therefore the toxic shell membrane they create is probably to ward off predators. ￼ And we clever humans, devised of ingenious ways to boil the shit out of them, just simply make them edible and not kill us. And the truth is, if you only ate beans you would not die, but… If you want to be the most demigod of them all, obviously you’re not going to be some sort of poverty person just consuming beans for some sort of strange higher altruistic purpose? Instead, you feast on the finest the bone marrow, the finest lamb ribs, just think about the hut of Achilles, what did he eat, and feed his guests? You know how they talk about life before Jesus life after Jesus, BC and AD… I am quite certain that a similar concept will happen with Satoshi. Like before Satoshi, life BS (before Satoshi, haha sounds like BS), and life AFTER Satoshi (AS). ￼ so the issue with being a modern day human or even American is that so much of the economic policies are obfuscated from the general public. For example. When I was in Saigon, in Vietnam off the grid, I had some time to critically think about economic theory and the like, to really try to critically understand on how currency is printed, made dominant around the planet, supported by US military force etc. In fact, if you think about the whole American the US military complex, it is basically focused on pumping money into the military industry, in order to assert military dominance on the planet, so all the weaker nations will have to force to use our dollars and accept and use our dollars, And also… America being able to pile on infinite debt obligations, knowing that she never intends to pay any of it back. So if we think about that, we know about debt in context of just being a normal human being, we don’t really know and understand debt in terms of an American national policy. For example, as a human being there’s a certain point in which numbers don’t really mean anything anymore. For example, I told you that the American national debt was 900 trillion, 45 trillion, $10 trillion, $18.3 trillion, would you be able to really understand or grasp this? Of course no! We daily humans, assume that you’re making like I don’t know 40,000 60,000, $80,000 a year… Which means maybe let us say that after taxes you’re pulling in like five to $6000 a month. If this is the case, the law of large numbers; at a certain point certain numbers don’t really mean anything to us, nor are they connected to reality. For example, the average American has never seen $1 million in their checking account or their bank balance, let alone 10 million, 100 million, 1 billion, 10 billion, 100 billion etc. ￼ There is a certain point in which numbers, ones and zeros, don’t really register in our brains. I always make the joke that I’m an Asian who is really really bad at math. And even now I am. And ironically enough, out of all my friends or typical normal human beings I know, besides Elon Musk and Michael Saylor, I am like by far the most successful innovator entrepreneur and investor of all time. I know no other human in the flesh who has stacked as many bitcoins as I have, and pretty much for the most part I never had to ever or I never panic sold any of my bitcoin. Besides selling some bitcoin like three years ago to just max out my Roth IRA contribution for the year, which ultimately I guess was a good idea because that money went into microstrategy MSTR, which is growing at an alarming rate, ￼– fortunately I had the wisdom of Odysseus; covering my ears and eyes with digital beeswax. ￼ About it, in hindsight, maybe one of the most interesting things I did was quit email in the year 2017. I might check my email like every six months or so for like authentication codes to sign into random portals, but besides this, I no longer really use email as a form of communication. If I’m doing like a workshop and I need to communicate some sort of critical information, ￼ then I’ll just copy and paste a bunch of emails, linked to Google sheets or something to send out a Zoom link or something. But besides this, email is really kind of a not good form of communication. Let us consider, i’m almost starting to feel like sending emails like sending a fax in the year 2024. I actually find it 1 trillion times more better to just FaceTime people as needed, — just think about it… All these sci-fi movies in the past, when they communicate with some sort of computer or AI, how do they do it? When you’re chatting with Jarvis it is all just a voice, and then you do the 3-D hologram thing with your hands like Tony Stark. Or if you’re Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit, what do you do? You talk to Jarvis naturally, when Jarvis is inside your helmet. In fact, I believe that the original Iron Man might be one of the best films of all time, I intend on watching it again. Anyways, once again, there is no exciting movie which is actually about somebody taking out a phone like an iPhone and either sending you a text message quietly, and or, sending a long tedious email? This will not make a fun movie. Anyways, as a consequence, I think the best concept is thinking about information information flows more critically, harder stronger faster. But knowing how to filter it. The first idea is Twitter and X. It might be the world‘s newest most valuable and only useful social media platform, now that Elon Musk runs the show, and I’m like 1000% Elon, it is really truly the best and only place to get critical information about financial news etc. My thought is traditional news outlets will die a slow gradual death, just like blockbuster. It’s funny, because I remember when I was in college, and I already saw my roommate Kevin ordering Netflix DVDs in the mail, which at the time I thought was very bizarre, but I knew that blockbuster was on the way out. I wanted to short blockbuster, but eventually did not because I just didn’t know how to do it, even now I’m not quite sure how to short a stock, it just seems too complicated. ERIC Semmler, one of the head honchos at semler scientific, is also on the bitcoin standard, using bitcoin yield, BTC yield as a measure of positive performance. Funny enough he also shares my name. Anyways, I listen to an interview between him and Natalie Brunel, and something was interesting was ERIC who has been in the game for a long time, the century said that shorting stocks is actually really really difficult and very rarely profitable. Rather a lot better to instead, to just go along in a positive way for a stock. And also I agree from a philosophical perspective, voting on the success of something, and voting on the success of a stocking company, to me almost morally an ethically feels superior; the reason being is that it just feels more positive and constructive. And also it might be more profitable? Investing in bitcoin is kinda good for everybody, even if you’re like kind of anti-establishment, anti-capitalism… Bitcoin is a positively good thing. Why? If you invest in bitcoin and you purchase bitcoin, and you put yourself in your family on a bitcoin standard, the upside and positivity is that You are essentially giving a middle finger to the establishment, the “man”. For example, anybody who is a non-conformist, punk rock, into rapper hip-hop culture whatever… Steve Jobs follower, etc., should be for bitcoin. Why? Because once again, it is anti-mainstream! Even now, bitcoin is pretty much mainstream now. Whenever you check any of the news channels, what is the best news all the time, all day every day? Bitcoin! It is the only interesting news which is happening on the planet, and will always be the best news of all time. In fact, my thought is ultimate new most important media people personalities etc. will be essentially people who work in TV Cinema media rappers podcast musicians bloggers vloggers thought leaders who philosophies and create content about bitcoin. First, Bitcoin is like the new iPhone. ￼ except the upside is that instead of every six months or a year or a year and a half, bitcoin is getting updated, all day, every day, every minute on the planet. So for example, with the iPhone and Apple… All these Fan boys just jerking off to Apple rumor news, waiting for the next next next next big thing to come out that will totally change and revolutionized their lives creativity etc. But, come on guys, we’re all technologists here and digital natives– don’t we already know that the solution is staring in our face, bitcoin? If you’re the type of person like you always want the newest iPhone Pro, Tesla, cyber truck, iPad Pro etc., isn’t also the same ethos be that you should always want the newest monetary technology which is bitcoin? Once again, very bizarre. Let us say you work at Apple Amazon Facebook Google Meta etc.… And your program or a software engineer, a developer, or somebody who works “tech”– is there any irrational reason you should be anti-bitcoin? No! I would say maybe the only negative downside is if you work in tech and you are a lemming. Even now Reddit is dead; if you’re still on Reddit, you’re not it. ￼ Also, maybe the issue here is that you’re kind of old enough now, and you’re kind of mildly successful, but maybe the issue here is that too much of your net worth is tied into your company dog? Just sell it guys, buy bitcoin instead, And or just buy micro strategy MSTR stock instead. It doesn’t matter if you’re being paid like $10 million a year at Apple Amazon Google Facebook, nobody actually wants to be there. Maybe besides Tim Cook? Let us consider, all of the innovators have left Apple. Jony Ive, and some people that I know who was in the head of the Apple Photos team. The only ones who have stayed at the big companies is that maybe, they’re stuck in a rut, maybe they have a mortgage to pay or something. If you do the maths a mortgage is actually insanely expensive like 10,000 or $11,000 a month? To even pour more money into a sink sink hole, which has true negative yield? A very very bad idea. It’s almost like it’s super cold outside, and you want to warm up by taking a nice hot bath. Can you turn on the bathwater, and you put up the plug, but, you kind of either leave the drain plug unplugged like halfway, or, You have it totally unplugged. So even if the water faucet is strong and the water is flowing into your tub at a quick rate, the rate in which the water goes down the drain might either be equal or lower than your input of water. So maybe the same thing with income, like inflow, or like flowing hot water. Assuming you want a nice hot tub of water, you want to drain the plug, stop the plug, stop it up 100%, and you want the hot water to rise and fill! Maybe we should think about the same thing with investing, and money leverage, Stop the water loss! We lose it when we have a mortgage on the home, and even a more pernicious thought; property taxes. Like let us say you buy that $2 million home in all cash, you’re still gonna be paying like 2500 or $2600 a month and adjust property taxes, which almost like attaching a leech to yourself which no matter what, the leech just sucks the blood out of you with no benefit to you. Now I am all for taxes, taxes are good. Yet, because I’ve just rented my whole life, property ownership home ownership even owning a single-family home seems like such a scam; you buy the lot for like $1.1 million, you add an ADU additional dwelling unit in the back for like $350,000, and then you try to flip it for like $200,000 More? Isn’t it just way easier to just buy bitcoin instead? The big reason is the cost to capital; all the headache and time to find the contractor to build the house, fix it up, renovate it, dealing with permits and all these headaches; and also your time cost to capital; so much time and headache and communication back-and-forth, is not really worth it. ￼ At this point because I’m dumb rich, to me the finances and the money aspect doesn’t really bother me, more of my concern and fear and dread is about having to deal with some sort of degenerate contractor, who buy the laws of physics and entropy will always be Late, more expensive, and will probably take one or two years longer than you expect. If you plan on doing the home thing, maybe the best idea is just approach things as if you will never hire help or a contractor? Then this way it could become more of a creative endeavor, and also, you know that you will never blame anyone else but yourself? Even like changing your own oil, the virtues of changing your own oil is pretty funny; I hate feeling ripped off, and I always feel super stupid for paying somebody else to change my oil. Even though it’s a huge pain in the butt for me to do it myself, I just have like 1 trillion times more joy and pride that I changed my own oil in my 2010 Prius, With mobile 1 full synthetic, and a K&N performance oil filter. It’s funny when I drive, I always have a huge grin and sense of pride on my face because I knew that I changed my own oil, 1 trillion more times happiness than even maybe driving a cyber truck or a Lamborghini? Nobody cares about your four bitcoin Ferrari; Once again, what I find so disruptive is that now… You will feel more joy pride and happiness to own the bitcoin, because you will always remember the number in your head in your mind, and you’ll always smile when you see the price exploding, rather than being stuck in a Diluted asset, whether does that be your yacht, Ferrari or Lamborghini. Or even your Porsche. If you really want to be happy, the optimal strategy assuming that you like own more than one car, or you don’t really need some sort of expensive performance vehicle that guzzles 91 octane gas, then I think optimal strategies to sell the extra car, and just buy bitcoin! In fact, if your goal is to actually make more money to upgrade to the next car, a funny strategy then is to just invest in bitcoin, write it up, make a shit load of money, and then just sell some of it later, to buy your next car. I’m super excited, the first time ever, I’m doing a free online open source zoom workshop, and don’t worry I will record it and post it later and share it with you because I feel like this is my new ethical imperative. I’m going to do it December 14, Saturday 10am to noon, Pacific time LA TIME. ￼ to register for the workshop to get the Zoom link, just fill out your email informed here, and before the workshop date, maybe like a day prior or so, I’ll email you with a Zoom link. FREE BITCOIN WORKSHOP REGISTRATION FORM You could also see some more details here. Essentially my vision is I just want to do a soft introduction to bitcoin the philosophy of it etc., the first hour hour and a half will just be like introductions and my lecture, and then I will leave some time at the end for questions and answers. It might go a bit over but whatever.￼ ￼￼￼ It will be totally 100% open and free, and also open source, so feel free to send the link to your friends, your mom or your dad who doesn’t really understand bitcoin, also I am fluent in Korean and Vietnamese, and also Spanish if you have some sort of bilingual parents you want to bring along. ￼> FREE BITCOIN WORKSHOP REGISTRATION FORM You could also see some more details here.

Profits increase to €4.7m for Persian Restaurants, which runs several outlets Amir Afsar The operator of the first McDonald’s outlet in Ireland, on Dublin’s Grafton Street, last year recorded pre-tax profits of €4.68m. Owned by Amir Afsar, Persian Restaurants Ltd operates a number of McDonald’s restaurants in Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford, including the Grafton Street outlet. New accounts show the company’s revenues increased by 9pc from €48.28m to €52.72m. The pre-tax profit of €4.68m followed a pre-tax loss of €220,497 in 2022. The loss was mainly due to a payout of €5.6m to directors. Pay to directors last year was less than 10pc of the 2022 payout at €531,557, made up of emoluments of €487,000, and €44,557 in pension contributions. Persian Restaurants also operates McDonald’s at the Nutgrove Shopping Centre, in Rathfarnham, and the Frascati Shopping Centre, in Blackrock. The Grafton Street outlet is the country’s oldest McDonald’s. It opened in 1977. The company last year recorded post-tax profits of €4.07m after incurring a corporation tax charge of €614,737. The profit last year takes account of non-cash depreciation costs of €1.24m. At the end of December, accumulated profits at the company totalled €19.59m, and the company had cash of €19m. Another McDonald’s franchisee, Elaine Sterio, operates five McDonald’s restaurants in the Co Louth and north Dublin areas. The most recent accounts for Ms Sterio’s Glenellen Restaurants Ltd show its revenues increased from €21.52m to €24.68m in 2022. Ms Sterio started working for McDonald’s in 1989 while studying. Pre-tax profits at Glenellen Restaurants in 2022 decreased by 20pc from €1.47m to €1.16m. Numbers employed decreased from 342 to 320 as staff costs increased from €7.05m to €7.7m. McDonald’s is currently embarking on a €40m expansion plan for Ireland, which will create 1,000 jobs here over the next four years. It now has 95 restaurants here, all of which are operated by franchisees. McDonald’s invested €42m between 2018 and 2023 in Ireland. This included the refurbishment of existing outlets and the opening of new restaurants. As part of the investment, McDonald’s currently has two planning applications before Tipperary Co Council and Wexford Co Council, for new restaurants. A number of locals in Thurles, Co Tipperary, are objecting to McDonald’s Ireland constructing a new drive-thru fast-food restaurant for Thurles, on health grounds. In one objection, Ronan Spain, of Carraig Donn, Clongour, Thurles, told the council: “As a father of two young children, I object to the development of a fast-food restaurant on health grounds, particularly as we are in the midst of an obesity crisis in this country, where one in five children aged under five is obese, according to a study referenced on the HSE website on October 10th 2024.” The council has placed the application but the only item the planning authority has sought further information from concerns a traffic issue. McDonald’s is to provide an assessment of traffic queuing at the drive-thru. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Tether was an outlaw for years. Now the $132 billion stablecoin has a key ally in Trump’s Cabinet
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/11/25/commerce-nominee-howard-lutnick-tether-booster-cantor-fitzgerald/
Time Published: 2024-11-25T18:01:47Z
Full Content:
For a decade, the crypto firm Tether built itself into one of the world’s wealthiest financial institutions, recently surpassing even mighty BlackRock in profits. Today, Tether’s eponymous stablecoin, a digital token pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, is one of the world’s major currencies, and the company, which has long operated in the financial shadows, is making a play for mainstream legitimacy. Now, thanks to a mix of sound strategy or good luck, Tether has a key ally in the highest corridors of power: Howard Lutnick, CEO of U.S. financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, and President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for commerce secretary. Cantor Fitzgerald serves as the main custodian for Tether’s U.S. Treasury bills, which are the primary asset backing Tether’s stablecoin. Lutnick—who rebuilt Cantor Fitzgerald after 658 of its employees died on 9/11—has been touting Tether in TV appearances and recently bought a 5% ownership stake in the crypto firm, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal. But with Tether facing a reported probe from the Justice and Treasury departments into possible money laundering violations, which the company has denied, critics warn Tether—whose founder is an Italian former plastic surgeon—may have undue influence at the highest levels of the U.S. government. “The first concern is any potential conflicts with the existing engagements that [Lutnick] has,” Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told Fortune. “It’s hard to imagine him remaining engaged in the way he is now and serving as commerce secretary.” To address this conflict of interest, Lutnick reportedly plans to hand over Cantor Fitzgerald’s relationship with Tether to his colleagues and to his son, who interned with the crypto firm. A spokesperson for the Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Tether has long been one of the most powerful—and scrutinized—companies in crypto, thanks to its ubiquitous stablecoin, which is used for global trading and as a financial hedge for people without access to the dollar. As a result of its offshore operations and often opaque business practices, Tether has also faced scrutiny about the integrity of its reserves, and its popularity with drug traffickers and terrorism financiers. Tether has been subject to enforcement actions as well, including by the New York attorney general and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and is reportedly facing a probe by the Justice and Treasury Departments. Tether has denied it is complicit in illegal activities, and touted its work with law enforcement agencies and blockchain analytics firms such as TRM Labs. In the past, a big source of mistrust around Tether has been its reliance on little-known banks as partners, including the Bahamian Deltec, to manage the reserve of dollars and Treasury bills that are intended to keep its stablecoin pegged to $1. For this reason, its relationship with New York–based Cantor Fitzgerald, which Lutnick first disclosed in a December 2023 podcast, has been a key boost. “I’m a big fan of this stablecoin called Tether,” he said at the time. Lutnick has since boosted the company’s work at crypto conferences. According to the Wall Street Journal, the two firms began working together in late 2021. The alliance between Cantor Fitzgerald and Tether is growing closer. In addition to the former’s ownership stake, the Wall Street firm is reportedly planning a Bitcoin lending program. Along with his work at Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick served as one of Trump’s economic advisors during his 2024 presidential campaign, later leading transition efforts. Lutnick was in the running for the Treasury secretary position until last week, when he was named as Trump’s nominee for commerce instead. A Treasury appointment would have created more conflict over Lutnick’s relationship with Tether, owing to the department’s reported probe into the company as well as the fact that Treasury is a much more influential department than commerce. Nonetheless, House, the Columbia professor, warns that any cabinet position will hold substantial influence in the White House, in part owing to access to privileged information and overlapping regulatory frameworks. Stablecoin legislation is set to be a policy priority for the Republican-controlled Congress during the next session. “If the diversion from consideration of Mr. Lutnick for Treasury secretary to commerce secretary is being posited as a way to reduce or weaken concerns about conflict of interest, I think that is misguided,” House said. “Because those concerns will remain regardless of the type of cabinet-level role one would take.” He added that it is common for business executives to take on cabinet positions, but that any possible conflicts should be reviewed during the confirmation process. Despite Lutnick’s assurances that he will step down from Cantor and divest himself of any interests, investors seem to be reacting to Tether’s growing prospects, with its market cap growing by nearly $15 billion since the presidential election. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bitcoin Buying Plans Are Supercharging Stocks. Is This a Michael Saylor Redux — or Another 'Long Island Iced Tea' Fad?

Time Published: 2024-11-25T17:54:48Z
Full Content:
What does the ragtag group including a fitness equipment maker, biopharmaceutical company and producer of battery materials have in common? Bitcoin, of course. As the cryptocurrency skyrockets to unheard-of levels this month, at least 12 publicly traded companies that previously had nothing to do with crypto announced they plan to buy bitcoin (BTC), choosing it as a modern — and, lately, quite profitable — place to park spare cash. It's a path illuminated by Michael Saylor's laser eyes since 2020, when he began converting his sleepy software maker MicroStrategy into a corporate vault for bitcoin. That's turned MicroStrategy into a massive stock market success — up roughly 30 times in value since Saylor began buying bitcoin for the company, amassing a massive stockpile now worth about $38 billion. Just this month, its shares have nearly doubled in price since Donald Trump was elected U.S. president after pledging to embrace crypto. (Other crypto stocks have jumped, too. Coinbase, the exchange operator, is up nearly 70% since the day before the election.) Others are trying to duplicate that success. On Friday, a biotech company, Anixa Biosciences (ANIX), said its board of directors approved buying an undisclosed amount of bitcoin to diversify the company's treasury reserves. The stock rallied as much as 19% but settled for a 5% advance by the end of the day. Meanwhile, on Thursday, fitness equipment company Interactive Strength (TRNR) said it plans to buy up to $5 million of bitcoin after its board approved the cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset. Following the announcement, its stock soared more than 80% at one point before settling for "only" a full-day gain of 11%. Earlier last week, biopharma company Hoth Therapeutics (HOTH) announced a $1 million bitcoin buying plan, triggering an up to 25% surge in its stock — though nearly the entire rally fizzled by the end of the day. Similarly, companies including LQR House (LQR), Cosmos Health (COSM), Nano Labs (NA), Gaxos (GXAI), Solidion Technology (STI) and Genius Group (GNS) saw momentary spikes in their stock prices after revealing bitcoin treasury plans in November. Only one company fell after its announcement: Acurx Pharma (ACXP). "The recent bitcoin boom, coupled with MicroStrategy's 500+% stock surge in 2024, has inspired a wave of companies — particularly microcaps — to announce bitcoin buying strategies," said Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining (BTCM). Whether these newcomers to the Saylor playbook will ever see Saylor-like benefits remains a very open question. "This behavior could end the same way [as previous bull markets]: unsustainable hype followed by sharp corrections as the market realizes many of these announcements lack substance," Yang said. And whether the recent entrants ever follow through is also technically unknown. So far, only artificial intelligence firm Genius Group is known to have actually bought any bitcoin. But who can blame them for trying? Investors who invested early in MicroStrategy are getting ridiculously rich, and even recent investors are making easy money. Saylor largely funds MicroStrategy's bitcoin purchases with money raised from stock and debt sales. The copycats might gain access to capital markets that they wouldn't otherwise have had. Traders are following the old adage, "Never fight the tape" — meaning follow the market's direction no matter the fundamentals, while companies are providing what the market wants. Nobody wants to be "that" person or company telling their bosses, shareholders or anybody else that they underperformed the market because they didn't follow MicroStrategy's footsteps. "Only a few years ago, it was almost too risky to buy bitcoin. Now, however, the risk increasingly seems to be the opposite — not buying is actually the risk," said Brian D. Evans, the CEO and founder of BDE Ventures, adding that "there’s real pain in not having exposure." To the hopefuls, this sudden corporate scramble might be a sign that mainstream bitcoin adoption is finally arriving, especially in an environment where President-elect Trump has said he wants the U.S. government to stockpile bitcoin, too. "For BTC proponents, the expectation is that a combination of macro factors such as inflation and new-found regulatory friendliness will spur further examples of the asset being placed on corporate balance sheets," Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial said in a report. Also, a bitcoin buying strategy could open up capital markets for companies, like it did for MicroStrategy and miner MARA Digital (MARA). Both were able to raise money recently through convertible debt that pays no interest to investors, meaning those investors are willing to forego current income in exchange for the ability to eventually convert the debt to equity, thus gaining bitcoin exposure. Saying they plan to buy bitcoin "is a useful way for companies to raise capital, not unlike the way MicroStrategy has done over the last few years," said BDE's Evans. However, to cynical ears, it all sounds a bit like the passing fad in the late 2010s that involved companies that previously had nothing to do with crypto adding the word "Blockchain" to their corporate name. The most famous example of this was little-known beverage maker Long Island Iced Tea renaming itself Long Blockchain, with an explosive result, at least initially: Its share price nearly tripled in a single day after the crypto-rechristening. The gains didn't stick and the stock was later delisted by Nasdaq. (And three people were accused of insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.) There have been other magic words. In the 2021 crypto bull market, big-name companies touted their Web3, metaverse and non-fungible token (NFT) initiatives — trying to hitch their shares to crypto and related hype. Facebook even changed its name to Meta to focus on the metaverse business, which subsequently faced massive losses. Meanwhile, companies with languishing share prices and no connection to crypto dipped their toes into bitcoin mining, a then extremely profitable business. The brutal bear market that followed turned crypto terminology into dirty words that few wanted to use. Though MicroStrategy has been able to raise billions from capital markets to fund bitcoin purchases, such a strategy, if pursued by others, could backfire for smaller companies, said Yang. "For microcaps, it risks being seen as a short-term gimmick, deterring serious investors. If bitcoin's price stabilizes or declines, the stocks' speculative appeal may fade, leaving these firms vulnerable to investor skepticism and regulatory scrutiny." Echoing this sentiment, David Siemer, co-founder and CEO of Wave Digital Assets, said, "While this approach may yield short-term gains in a bullish market, it carries significant risks. Unlike straightforward asset holding, leverage amplifies potential losses during market corrections, underscoring its inherent danger," he said, pointing to firms that are leveraging the hype around bitcoin to add debt to their balance sheet. Regardless of who is right, with bitcoin repeatedly smashing all-time highs after Trump's U.S. election win, magic remains in the air: Announce a Saylor-like bitcoin plan and see your stock take off. "It’s almost as though we are at a point where a lot of companies feel compelled to do this," BDE's Evans said. Welcome to the new crypto bull market.

Title: Is Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (SHLS) the Best Renewable Energy Penny Stock to Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Renewable Energy Penny Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS) stands against the other renewable energy penny stocks. On November 11, the Financial Times reported that the U.S. clean energy industry faces a significant setback following Donald Trump’s election victory. The article highlights that several developers have halted projects, and investors are selling shares due to uncertainties about policy direction and federal funding under the incoming Trump administration. According to Mike Carr, president of Solar Energy Manufacturers for America, approximately half a dozen clean energy projects are awaiting policy certainty before proceeding. Trump’s election, combined with the prospect of a Republican-controlled Congress, has led to a sharp decline in renewable energy stocks. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF dropped 7% after the election. Additionally, short sellers of renewable energy stocks reportedly profited over $1 billion in the aftermath. Despite the turbulence, some industry leaders and analysts remain cautiously optimistic, suggesting that the economic case for renewable projects could persist under a Trump administration. They also believe that existing tax credits for power generation and manufacturing may remain intact. However, they warn that sectors such as offshore wind and electric vehicles may face significant challenges. Trump has pledged to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, a major driver of U.S. clean energy investment, and vowed to expand oil and gas production while halting offshore wind projects and EV mandates. Biden’s target to reduce emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels by 2030 is at risk under a second Trump term. Such a shift could result in an additional 500 million tonnes of carbon emissions in the energy sector by the end of the decade. While uncertainties loom over the renewable energy sector, the industry continues to demonstrate resilience. According to a report by Rhodium Group, a New York-based research institute, the renewable energy and transportation investment in the United States has continued to break records, reaching a new high of $71 billion in the third quarter of 2024. This marks a 12% increase from the same period in 2023 and a nearly unbroken quarter-on-quarter growth trend over the past three years. The report highlights that renewable investment accounted for 5% of total US private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods, up from 4.5% in the third quarter of 2023. Retail investment was a major driver of this growth, increasing by 9% relative to the previous quarter, largely due to a surge in zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales. However, investment in renewable technology manufacturing remained flat quarter-on-quarter, while investment in deploying technology to decarbonize energy and industrial production slipped 7% quarter-on-quarter. The report also assessed the progress of the US renewable electricity transition and found that the current pace of capacity expansion is falling short of what is needed to deliver a 40% reduction in net GHG emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. The analysis of projects in the pipeline suggests that both solar and wind are underperforming, aligning more closely with a scenario that would yield only a 30% reduction by 2030. Despite the challenges and uncertainties facing the renewable energy sector, the industry's resilience and potential for growth remain evident. With that in context, let's take a look at the 10 best renewable energy penny stocks to invest in. Our Methodology To compile our list of the 10 best renewable energy penny stocks to invest in, we used clean energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 renewable energy stocks trading below $5 as of November 22. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 10 stocks according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from the database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27 Stock Price as of November 22: $4.40 Shoals Technologies (NASDAQ:SHLS) is a prominent player in the solar energy and electric vehicle industries. The company has successfully deployed its products across over 62 GW of solar systems globally and holds an impressive portfolio of more than 66 patents. Shoals Technologies is widely recognized for its cutting-edge electrical balance of systems (EBOS) solutions, which have established a new standard in the industry. On November 12, Shoals Technologies’ (NASDAQ:SHLS) reported results for the third quarter ended September 30. The company experienced a year-over-year revenue decline of 24%, due to project delays. However, the company’s net loss was recorded at $300,000 compared to $9.8 million during the prior-year period, which indicates a potential recovery trend. The company’s gross profit percentage came at 24.8% compared to 10.5% in the prior-year period. This increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the decrease in wire insulation shrinkback expenses. As of September 30, Shoals Technologies’ (NASDAQ:SHLS) has a backlog and awarded orders totaling $596.6 million. Shoals Technologies (NASDAQ:SHLS) has introduced a variety of innovative products designed to optimize solar and electric vehicle (EV) installations. The company’s revolutionary Big Lead Assembly (BLA) System transformed the solar installation technology by integrating multiple components into a single unit, which cuts installation costs by 43% and material costs by 20%. Furthermore, Shoals Technologies’ (NASDAQ:SHLS) Interconnect System streamlines the process of connecting solar panels to the grid, reducing reliance on specialized labor and increasing efficiency. The company’s patented connectors and wire harnesses with in-line fuses also provide a cost-effective solution for solar installations. Overall SHLS ranks 1st on our list of the best renewable energy penny stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SHLS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

According to a report by Rhodium Group, a New York-based research institute, the renewable energy and transportation investment in the United States has continued to break records, reaching a new high of $71 billion in the third quarter of 2024. This marks a 12% increase from the same period in 2023 and a nearly unbroken quarter-on-quarter growth trend over the past three years. The report highlights that renewable investment accounted for 5% of total US private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods, up from 4.5% in the third quarter of 2023. Retail investment was a major driver of this growth, increasing by 9% relative to the previous quarter, largely due to a surge in zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales. However, investment in renewable technology manufacturing remained flat quarter-on-quarter, while investment in deploying technology to decarbonize energy and industrial production slipped 7% quarter-on-quarter. The report also assessed the progress of the US renewable electricity transition and found that the current pace of capacity expansion is falling short of what is needed to deliver a 40% reduction in net GHG emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. The analysis of projects in the pipeline suggests that both solar and wind are underperforming, aligning more closely with a scenario that would yield only a 30% reduction by 2030. Despite the challenges and uncertainties facing the renewable energy sector, the industry's resilience and potential for growth remain evident. With that in context, let's take a look at the 10 best renewable energy penny stocks to invest in. Our Methodology To compile our list of the 10 best renewable energy penny stocks to invest in, we used clean energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 renewable energy stocks trading below $5 as of November 22. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 10 stocks according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from the database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A row of fuel pumps at a fueling station, displaying the magnitude of the energy revolution. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22 Stock Price as of November 22: $2.71 Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ:CLNE) is a leading provider of natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets. The company is the largest supplier and producer of renewable natural gas (RNG), that utilizes organic waste to produce RNG. Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ:CLNE) also supplies compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, along with operating fueling stations for public and private vehicle fleets. On November 6, Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ:CLNE) announced its results for the third quarter ended on September 30. The company’s adjusted EBITDA surged to $21.3 million, a substantial 50% increase from $14.2 million in the same quarter last year. Additionally, revenue rose to $105 million, reflecting a 9% increase from $96 million in Q3 2023. A key driver of Clean Energy Fuels Corp.’s (NASDAQ:CLNE) success is its expanding fueling network. Over the past year, the company has grown its network by nearly 15%, including the addition of a new station for Amazon in New Jersey. This strategic expansion is expected to attract more customers and boost fuel volumes. The launch of the Cummins X15N engine, a 15-liter natural gas engine built to match the performance and reliability of its diesel counterpart, is another catalyst for growth, with major fleets such as JB Hunt and UPS already providing positive feedback. In addition, Clean Energy Fuels Corp.’s (NASDAQ:CLNE) partnership with Tourmaline in Canada continues to gain momentum, with new stations opening and plans for a natural gas fueling corridor that further strengthens its presence in the Canadian market. Overall CLNE ranks 2nd on our list of the best renewable energy penny stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of CLNE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CLNE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

I don’t think I know any human being on the planet who doesn’t want to be rich, or tries to increase their worth their net worth etc. Doesn’t matter if you’re an investor, work for a charity, a church etc. Money and capital are critical, it is like our economic life blood. For example, maybe you should think about blood. Blood is a critical and essential. Nobody could survive or thrive without blood. Now imagine… That somebody is taking your help four-year-old child, in drawing a pint of blood from them a day. What is going to happen to the health of your kid? It will severely stunt his growth, or positively kill him. Another thing… Imagine like you’re eating only rancid food your whole life, and the theory, you’re not going to die from it, but… Ain’t nobody want to eat rancid food. Or, let us assume that you’re consuming certain foods to just keep you alive, like beans, but everyone knows that beans cause flatulence, even an ancient Roman times, and technically raw beans are toxic. Lagoons, naturally do not want to be eaten or consumed. And therefore the toxic shell membrane they create is probably to ward off predators. ￼ And we clever humans, devised of ingenious ways to boil the shit out of them, just simply make them edible and not kill us. And the truth is, if you only ate beans you would not die, but… If you want to be the most demigod of them all, obviously you’re not going to be some sort of poverty person just consuming beans for some sort of strange higher altruistic purpose? Instead, you feast on the finest the bone marrow, the finest lamb ribs, just think about the hut of Achilles, what did he eat, and feed his guests? You know how they talk about life before Jesus life after Jesus, BC and AD… I am quite certain that a similar concept will happen with Satoshi. Like before Satoshi, life BS (before Satoshi, haha sounds like BS), and life AFTER Satoshi (AS). ￼ so the issue with being a modern day human or even American is that so much of the economic policies are obfuscated from the general public. For example. When I was in Saigon, in Vietnam off the grid, I had some time to critically think about economic theory and the like, to really try to critically understand on how currency is printed, made dominant around the planet, supported by US military force etc. In fact, if you think about the whole American the US military complex, it is basically focused on pumping money into the military industry, in order to assert military dominance on the planet, so all the weaker nations will have to force to use our dollars and accept and use our dollars, And also… America being able to pile on infinite debt obligations, knowing that she never intends to pay any of it back. So if we think about that, we know about debt in context of just being a normal human being, we don’t really know and understand debt in terms of an American national policy. For example, as a human being there’s a certain point in which numbers don’t really mean anything anymore. For example, I told you that the American national debt was 900 trillion, 45 trillion, $10 trillion, $18.3 trillion, would you be able to really understand or grasp this? Of course no! We daily humans, assume that you’re making like I don’t know 40,000 60,000, $80,000 a year… Which means maybe let us say that after taxes you’re pulling in like five to $6000 a month. If this is the case, the law of large numbers; at a certain point certain numbers don’t really mean anything to us, nor are they connected to reality. For example, the average American has never seen $1 million in their checking account or their bank balance, let alone 10 million, 100 million, 1 billion, 10 billion, 100 billion etc. ￼ There is a certain point in which numbers, ones and zeros, don’t really register in our brains. I always make the joke that I’m an Asian who is really really bad at math. And even now I am. And ironically enough, out of all my friends or typical normal human beings I know, besides Elon Musk and Michael Saylor, I am like by far the most successful innovator entrepreneur and investor of all time. I know no other human in the flesh who has stacked as many bitcoins as I have, and pretty much for the most part I never had to ever or I never panic sold any of my bitcoin. Besides selling some bitcoin like three years ago to just max out my Roth IRA contribution for the year, which ultimately I guess was a good idea because that money went into microstrategy MSTR, which is growing at an alarming rate, ￼– fortunately I had the wisdom of Odysseus; covering my ears and eyes with digital beeswax. ￼ About it, in hindsight, maybe one of the most interesting things I did was quit email in the year 2017. I might check my email like every six months or so for like authentication codes to sign into random portals, but besides this, I no longer really use email as a form of communication. If I’m doing like a workshop and I need to communicate some sort of critical information, ￼ then I’ll just copy and paste a bunch of emails, linked to Google sheets or something to send out a Zoom link or something. But besides this, email is really kind of a not good form of communication. Let us consider, i’m almost starting to feel like sending emails like sending a fax in the year 2024. I actually find it 1 trillion times more better to just FaceTime people as needed, — just think about it… All these sci-fi movies in the past, when they communicate with some sort of computer or AI, how do they do it? When you’re chatting with Jarvis it is all just a voice, and then you do the 3-D hologram thing with your hands like Tony Stark. Or if you’re Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit, what do you do? You talk to Jarvis naturally, when Jarvis is inside your helmet. In fact, I believe that the original Iron Man might be one of the best films of all time, I intend on watching it again. Anyways, once again, there is no exciting movie which is actually about somebody taking out a phone like an iPhone and either sending you a text message quietly, and or, sending a long tedious email? This will not make a fun movie. Anyways, as a consequence, I think the best concept is thinking about information information flows more critically, harder stronger faster. But knowing how to filter it. The first idea is Twitter and X. It might be the world‘s newest most valuable and only useful social media platform, now that Elon Musk runs the show, and I’m like 1000% Elon, it is really truly the best and only place to get critical information about financial news etc. My thought is traditional news outlets will die a slow gradual death, just like blockbuster. It’s funny, because I remember when I was in college, and I already saw my roommate Kevin ordering Netflix DVDs in the mail, which at the time I thought was very bizarre, but I knew that blockbuster was on the way out. I wanted to short blockbuster, but eventually did not because I just didn’t know how to do it, even now I’m not quite sure how to short a stock, it just seems too complicated. ERIC Semmler, one of the head honchos at semler scientific, is also on the bitcoin standard, using bitcoin yield, BTC yield as a measure of positive performance. Funny enough he also shares my name. Anyways, I listen to an interview between him and Natalie Brunel, and something was interesting was ERIC who has been in the game for a long time, the century said that shorting stocks is actually really really difficult and very rarely profitable. Rather a lot better to instead, to just go along in a positive way for a stock. And also I agree from a philosophical perspective, voting on the success of something, and voting on the success of a stocking company, to me almost morally an ethically feels superior; the reason being is that it just feels more positive and constructive. And also it might be more profitable? Investing in bitcoin is kinda good for everybody, even if you’re like kind of anti-establishment, anti-capitalism… Bitcoin is a positively good thing. Why? If you invest in bitcoin and you purchase bitcoin, and you put yourself in your family on a bitcoin standard, the upside and positivity is that You are essentially giving a middle finger to the establishment, the “man”. For example, anybody who is a non-conformist, punk rock, into rapper hip-hop culture whatever… Steve Jobs follower, etc., should be for bitcoin. Why? Because once again, it is anti-mainstream! Even now, bitcoin is pretty much mainstream now. Whenever you check any of the news channels, what is the best news all the time, all day every day? Bitcoin! It is the only interesting news which is happening on the planet, and will always be the best news of all time. In fact, my thought is ultimate new most important media people personalities etc. will be essentially people who work in TV Cinema media rappers podcast musicians bloggers vloggers thought leaders who philosophies and create content about bitcoin. First, Bitcoin is like the new iPhone. ￼ except the upside is that instead of every six months or a year or a year and a half, bitcoin is getting updated, all day, every day, every minute on the planet. So for example, with the iPhone and Apple… All these Fan boys just jerking off to Apple rumor news, waiting for the next next next next big thing to come out that will totally change and revolutionized their lives creativity etc. But, come on guys, we’re all technologists here and digital natives– don’t we already know that the solution is staring in our face, bitcoin? If you’re the type of person like you always want the newest iPhone Pro, Tesla, cyber truck, iPad Pro etc., isn’t also the same ethos be that you should always want the newest monetary technology which is bitcoin? Once again, very bizarre. Let us say you work at Apple Amazon Facebook Google Meta etc.… And your program or a software engineer, a developer, or somebody who works “tech”– is there any irrational reason you should be anti-bitcoin? No! I would say maybe the only negative downside is if you work in tech and you are a lemming. Even now Reddit is dead; if you’re still on Reddit, you’re not it. ￼ Also, maybe the issue here is that you’re kind of old enough now, and you’re kind of mildly successful, but maybe the issue here is that too much of your net worth is tied into your company dog? Just sell it guys, buy bitcoin instead, And or just buy micro strategy MSTR stock instead. It doesn’t matter if you’re being paid like $10 million a year at Apple Amazon Google Facebook, nobody actually wants to be there. Maybe besides Tim Cook? Let us consider, all of the innovators have left Apple. Jony Ive, and some people that I know who was in the head of the Apple Photos team. The only ones who have stayed at the big companies is that maybe, they’re stuck in a rut, maybe they have a mortgage to pay or something. If you do the maths a mortgage is actually insanely expensive like 10,000 or $11,000 a month? To even pour more money into a sink sink hole, which has true negative yield? A very very bad idea. It’s almost like it’s super cold outside, and you want to warm up by taking a nice hot bath. Can you turn on the bathwater, and you put up the plug, but, you kind of either leave the drain plug unplugged like halfway, or, You have it totally unplugged. So even if the water faucet is strong and the water is flowing into your tub at a quick rate, the rate in which the water goes down the drain might either be equal or lower than your input of water. So maybe the same thing with income, like inflow, or like flowing hot water. Assuming you want a nice hot tub of water, you want to drain the plug, stop the plug, stop it up 100%, and you want the hot water to rise and fill! Maybe we should think about the same thing with investing, and money leverage, Stop the water loss! We lose it when we have a mortgage on the home, and even a more pernicious thought; property taxes. Like let us say you buy that $2 million home in all cash, you’re still gonna be paying like 2500 or $2600 a month and adjust property taxes, which almost like attaching a leech to yourself which no matter what, the leech just sucks the blood out of you with no benefit to you. Now I am all for taxes, taxes are good. Yet, because I’ve just rented my whole life, property ownership home ownership even owning a single-family home seems like such a scam; you buy the lot for like $1.1 million, you add an ADU additional dwelling unit in the back for like $350,000, and then you try to flip it for like $200,000 More? Isn’t it just way easier to just buy bitcoin instead? The big reason is the cost to capital; all the headache and time to find the contractor to build the house, fix it up, renovate it, dealing with permits and all these headaches; and also your time cost to capital; so much time and headache and communication back-and-forth, is not really worth it. ￼ At this point because I’m dumb rich, to me the finances and the money aspect doesn’t really bother me, more of my concern and fear and dread is about having to deal with some sort of degenerate contractor, who buy the laws of physics and entropy will always be Late, more expensive, and will probably take one or two years longer than you expect. If you plan on doing the home thing, maybe the best idea is just approach things as if you will never hire help or a contractor? Then this way it could become more of a creative endeavor, and also, you know that you will never blame anyone else but yourself? Even like changing your own oil, the virtues of changing your own oil is pretty funny; I hate feeling ripped off, and I always feel super stupid for paying somebody else to change my oil. Even though it’s a huge pain in the butt for me to do it myself, I just have like 1 trillion times more joy and pride that I changed my own oil in my 2010 Prius, With mobile 1 full synthetic, and a K&N performance oil filter. It’s funny when I drive, I always have a huge grin and sense of pride on my face because I knew that I changed my own oil, 1 trillion more times happiness than even maybe driving a cyber truck or a Lamborghini? Nobody cares about your four bitcoin Ferrari; Once again, what I find so disruptive is that now… You will feel more joy pride and happiness to own the bitcoin, because you will always remember the number in your head in your mind, and you’ll always smile when you see the price exploding, rather than being stuck in a Diluted asset, whether does that be your yacht, Ferrari or Lamborghini. Or even your Porsche. If you really want to be happy, the optimal strategy assuming that you like own more than one car, or you don’t really need some sort of expensive performance vehicle that guzzles 91 octane gas, then I think optimal strategies to sell the extra car, and just buy bitcoin! In fact, if your goal is to actually make more money to upgrade to the next car, a funny strategy then is to just invest in bitcoin, write it up, make a shit load of money, and then just sell some of it later, to buy your next car. I’m super excited, the first time ever, I’m doing a free online open source zoom workshop, and don’t worry I will record it and post it later and share it with you because I feel like this is my new ethical imperative. I’m going to do it December 14, Saturday 10am to noon, Pacific time LA TIME. ￼ to register for the workshop to get the Zoom link, just fill out your email informed here, and before the workshop date, maybe like a day prior or so, I’ll email you with a Zoom link. FREE BITCOIN WORKSHOP REGISTRATION FORM You could also see some more details here. Essentially my vision is I just want to do a soft introduction to bitcoin the philosophy of it etc., the first hour hour and a half will just be like introductions and my lecture, and then I will leave some time at the end for questions and answers. It might go a bit over but whatever.￼ ￼￼￼ It will be totally 100% open and free, and also open source, so feel free to send the link to your friends, your mom or your dad who doesn’t really understand bitcoin, also I am fluent in Korean and Vietnamese, and also Spanish if you have some sort of bilingual parents you want to bring along. ￼> FREE BITCOIN WORKSHOP REGISTRATION FORM You could also see some more details here.

Title: Why Photographers Should Understand Bitcoin
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2024/11/25/why-photographers-should-understand-bitcoin-2/
Time Published: 2024-11-25T16:08:23Z
Full Content:
Do you remember Kodak brownies and the like? Obviously digital photograph absolutely crushed Kodak, even though ironically Kodak I think made the first digital camera? Also, the very foolish and shortsighted thing that conducted; she almost self sabotage herself by kind of trying to kill off her own digital camera, concerned that we would eat into the profits of her film business. A similar insight; Steve Jobs, upon unleashing the iPhone, obviously he knew that it was going to eat into the iPod iPod touch market, but obviously it was the right step forward. This is a book that apparently Steve Jobs recommended everyone to read. The general idea is that the paradox and difficulty that innovator’s face is that in order to innovate something new, you kind of need to kill your own business, even have the courage to self cannibalize if necessary. So for example, I think Ford has done a decent job at this semi trying to get into the electric car market, instead of just hoarding her gas guzzler cars. But the difficulty of a Ford or any other car company is that because they did not start off 100% carte blanche electric, they’re never going to catch up to Tesla, Do you remember in the early days of Tesla, in which the evaluation was far greater than that of any major car company and everyone thought that it was insanely overvalued? Who is laughing now? So a book that nobody knows about is the mobile wave by Michael Saylor; in which he accurately predicts that mobile phones, mobile technology, all the big magnificent seven companies to take over the world. He predicted the success of Amazon Facebook Twitter Google and Apple before anyone really took notice. In fact I recommend everyone to read them all way, because it shows the inside that Michael Saylor is not new to the game; he’s been in the game for a long time, over 30 years. Apparently he has seen his stock drop to an ALL TIME LOW of $.20, And now it is currently in the mid 400s. So I guess I was right all along about bitcoin, ever since I bought like 2.2 bitcoins or 2.4 bitcoins for about 20,000 or $25,000, back in 2018 when bitcoin was only around $6000-$7000 a coin. ￼ sing that we’re about to have the hundred K party, I’ve almost I guess like 12 or 13 X ‘d my initial prediction? Anyways, if you’re right about bitcoin and was right about bitcoin… And no no no bitcoin is not gonna drop down to like 60,000 or 30,000, that does not how engineering works. For people who think that bitcoin is risky, ask people… Is it risky to cross the bridge or go on a flight? No. Why? Things were engineered that way! With bitcoin, you’re not gonna have all these people who you’re trying to proselytize turn around and tell you that you were right, and shower you with good news. No no no, they might either feel low-key envious or jealous of you, and won’t probably really say much. This is also why I don’t really tell people about bitcoin too much if they don’t seem like they have a strong need for it; for example my uncle who’s worked in the jewelry business for like over 30 years, he wants to retire, and I’m kind of in the process of helping him Sell his gold and his other reserves and stuff, in order to buy bitcoin. Even he at the age of 64, being a gold jeweler for like over 30 years know that bitcoin is the future. But his issues that he cannot stomach the volatility, he says it is like drugs, “mah-yyak”– when I was with him last I just set him up with Coinbase, and just bought the daily maximum for his account which was $3500, I think we bought windows around $65,000 a coin, and already it’s like $99,000 a coin. But once again, I think the difficult thing with bitcoin is that like is probably the most addictive crack cocaine on the planet, because it is being traded 24 7, it is extremely volatile because volatility is vitality. Anything that is allowed to trade every single waking moment, on weekends as well as the evenings, and also bank holidays, is going to have more volatility because people are just bored at home, they cannot play the traditional market so they’re going to just try to buy and sell bitcoin, do some sort of weird options trading to try to squeeze a few bucks here and there.￼ I was randomly think about Peter Thiel and his zero to one book; I think if you thought about bitcoin like a year or two ago, you might’ve seen that are artificial intelligence in AI was the right bet. But no, it is most certainly bitcoin. Why? Assuming that the world runs on money, and bitcoin is perfect money, it is like maybe 80 to 90% the solution to the problems of humanity. For example, what are the greatest bad things that happened to humans? It mostly has to deal with financial distress. I almost wonder people who get addicted to gambling, drugs, cycles of poverty is because the money right now the fiat currency is toxic. You cannot blame somebody for remaining sick if they only have a sewer water to drink, and they have kids and are also forced to feed their kids sewer water. It doesn’t matter how smart hard-working or intelligent you are, as long as you’re drinking sore water, you’re going to perpetually be sick, throwing up, permanently infected with cholera. So you know you have all these Crusades on the Internet and charity is talking about providing clean water to like poor kids in Africa? I think the same thing with bitcoin– it is like the chance to give clean water to 8 billion people on the planet. Except instead of water, it is clean money. Nontoxic money. It matters if you’re at church a nonprofit a charity, mother Teresa Gandhi etc. Matters if you’re at school, a parent organization, if you have kids you’re single own a dog whatever. Ultimately you’re going to have to pay the rent, pay your mortgage, or pay property taxes. I don’t think there is anyone spot on the planet in which you cannot live or survive without money a banking account or Notes. Even all these weirdos who try to buy a $200,000 AMG sprinter van and live off the grid with star Link or whatever, you still need money, and sooner or later you’re going to have to need some sort of semi permanent address, ideally your mom‘s house or your wife’s family‘s house or something. Because for the most part if you’re American, at this point you cannot really survive without having a single address for doing taxes and stuff. And I also think that now, unfortunately you also need a cell phone number, or else you cannot even apply for basic stuff, because you’re going to have to get the one time password authentication code codes texted to your phone. Anyways, it’s gonna be a big deal once Apple integrate bitcoin into her iCloud ecosystem. This is actually a very very big opportunity for Apple; the head of security, on the planet and privacy… If Apple were able to provide security to your bitcoin or your keys or whatever, Wooden apple being in some way is the best custodian?

Do you remember Kodak brownies and the like? Obviously digital photograph absolutely crushed Kodak, even though ironically Kodak I think made the first digital camera? Also, the very foolish and shortsighted thing that conducted; she almost self sabotage herself by kind of trying to kill off her own digital camera, concerned that we would eat into the profits of her film business. A similar insight; Steve Jobs, upon unleashing the iPhone, obviously he knew that it was going to eat into the iPod iPod touch market, but obviously it was the right step forward. This is a book that apparently Steve Jobs recommended everyone to read. The general idea is that the paradox and difficulty that innovator’s face is that in order to innovate something new, you kind of need to kill your own business, even have the courage to self cannibalize if necessary. So for example, I think Ford has done a decent job at this semi trying to get into the electric car market, instead of just hoarding her gas guzzler cars. But the difficulty of a Ford or any other car company is that because they did not start off 100% carte blanche electric, they’re never going to catch up to Tesla, Do you remember in the early days of Tesla, in which the evaluation was far greater than that of any major car company and everyone thought that it was insanely overvalued? Who is laughing now? So a book that nobody knows about is the mobile wave by Michael Saylor; in which he accurately predicts that mobile phones, mobile technology, all the big magnificent seven companies to take over the world. He predicted the success of Amazon Facebook Twitter Google and Apple before anyone really took notice. In fact I recommend everyone to read them all way, because it shows the inside that Michael Saylor is not new to the game; he’s been in the game for a long time, over 30 years. Apparently he has seen his stock drop to an ALL TIME LOW of $.20, And now it is currently in the mid 400s. So I guess I was right all along about bitcoin, ever since I bought like 2.2 bitcoins or 2.4 bitcoins for about 20,000 or $25,000, back in 2018 when bitcoin was only around $6000-$7000 a coin. ￼ sing that we’re about to have the hundred K party, I’ve almost I guess like 12 or 13 X ‘d my initial prediction? Anyways, if you’re right about bitcoin and was right about bitcoin… And no no no bitcoin is not gonna drop down to like 60,000 or 30,000, that does not how engineering works. For people who think that bitcoin is risky, ask people… Is it risky to cross the bridge or go on a flight? No. Why? Things were engineered that way! With bitcoin, you’re not gonna have all these people who you’re trying to proselytize turn around and tell you that you were right, and shower you with good news. No no no, they might either feel low-key envious or jealous of you, and won’t probably really say much. This is also why I don’t really tell people about bitcoin too much if they don’t seem like they have a strong need for it; for example my uncle who’s worked in the jewelry business for like over 30 years, he wants to retire, and I’m kind of in the process of helping him Sell his gold and his other reserves and stuff, in order to buy bitcoin. Even he at the age of 64, being a gold jeweler for like over 30 years know that bitcoin is the future. But his issues that he cannot stomach the volatility, he says it is like drugs, “mah-yyak”– when I was with him last I just set him up with Coinbase, and just bought the daily maximum for his account which was $3500, I think we bought windows around $65,000 a coin, and already it’s like $99,000 a coin. But once again, I think the difficult thing with bitcoin is that like is probably the most addictive crack cocaine on the planet, because it is being traded 24 7, it is extremely volatile because volatility is vitality. Anything that is allowed to trade every single waking moment, on weekends as well as the evenings, and also bank holidays, is going to have more volatility because people are just bored at home, they cannot play the traditional market so they’re going to just try to buy and sell bitcoin, do some sort of weird options trading to try to squeeze a few bucks here and there.￼ I was randomly think about Peter Thiel and his zero to one book; I think if you thought about bitcoin like a year or two ago, you might’ve seen that are artificial intelligence in AI was the right bet. But no, it is most certainly bitcoin. Why? Assuming that the world runs on money, and bitcoin is perfect money, it is like maybe 80 to 90% the solution to the problems of humanity. For example, what are the greatest bad things that happened to humans? It mostly has to deal with financial distress. I almost wonder people who get addicted to gambling, drugs, cycles of poverty is because the money right now the fiat currency is toxic. You cannot blame somebody for remaining sick if they only have a sewer water to drink, and they have kids and are also forced to feed their kids sewer water. It doesn’t matter how smart hard-working or intelligent you are, as long as you’re drinking sore water, you’re going to perpetually be sick, throwing up, permanently infected with cholera. So you know you have all these Crusades on the Internet and charity is talking about providing clean water to like poor kids in Africa? I think the same thing with bitcoin– it is like the chance to give clean water to 8 billion people on the planet. Except instead of water, it is clean money. Nontoxic money. It matters if you’re at church a nonprofit a charity, mother Teresa Gandhi etc. Matters if you’re at school, a parent organization, if you have kids you’re single own a dog whatever. Ultimately you’re going to have to pay the rent, pay your mortgage, or pay property taxes. I don’t think there is anyone spot on the planet in which you cannot live or survive without money a banking account or Notes. Even all these weirdos who try to buy a $200,000 AMG sprinter van and live off the grid with star Link or whatever, you still need money, and sooner or later you’re going to have to need some sort of semi permanent address, ideally your mom‘s house or your wife’s family‘s house or something. Because for the most part if you’re American, at this point you cannot really survive without having a single address for doing taxes and stuff. And I also think that now, unfortunately you also need a cell phone number, or else you cannot even apply for basic stuff, because you’re going to have to get the one time password authentication code codes texted to your phone. Anyways, it’s gonna be a big deal once Apple integrate bitcoin into her iCloud ecosystem. This is actually a very very big opportunity for Apple; the head of security, on the planet and privacy… If Apple were able to provide security to your bitcoin or your keys or whatever, Wooden apple being in some way is the best custodian? Even better yet… We already have our bank of counseling to Apple Pay. Wouldn’t it just makes sense for you to buy bitcoin directly on an iPhone using Apple Pay, and store it on your iPhone and or iCloud Apple ID account? For people who don’t trust the cloud I get it, but still… For all practical purposes I think the cloud is like 1 trillion times safer than cold storage options.

Title: How 123RF saved over 90% of their translation costs by switching to Amazon Bedrock

In the rapidly evolving digital content industry, multilingual accessibility is crucial for global reach and user engagement. 123RF, a leading provider of royalty-free digital content, is an online resource for creative assets, including AI-generated images from text. In 2023, they used Amazon OpenSearch Service to improve discovery of images by using vector-based semantic search. Building on this success, they have now implemented Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku to improve their content moderation a hundredfold and more sped up content translation to further enhance their global reach and efficiency. Although the company achieved significant success among English-speaking users with its generative AI-based semantic search tool, it faced content discovery challenges in 15 other languages because of English-only titles and keywords. The cost of using Google Translate for continuous translations was prohibitive, and other models such as Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet and OpenAI GPT-4o weren’t cost-effective. Although OpenAI GPT-3.5 met cost criteria, it struggled with consistent output quality. This prompted 123RF to search for a more reliable and affordable solution to enhance multilingual content discovery. This post explores how 123RF used Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku, and a vector store to efficiently translate content metadata, significantly reduce costs, and improve their global content discovery capabilities. After implementing generative AI-based semantic search and text-to-image generation, they saw significant traction among English-speaking users. This success, however, cast a harsh light on a critical gap in their global strategy: their vast library of digital assets—comprising millions of images, audio files, and motion graphics—needed a similar overhaul for non-English speaking users. The crux of the problem lay in the nature of their content. User-generated titles, keywords, and descriptions—the lifeblood of searchability in the digital asset world—were predominantly in English. To truly serve a global audience and unlock the full potential of their library, 123RF needed to translate this metadata into 15 different languages. But as they quickly discovered, the path to multilingual content was filled with financial and technical challenges. Idioms don’t always translate well As 123RF dove deeper into the challenge, they uncovered layers of complexity that went beyond simple word-for-word translation. The preceding figure shows one particularly difficult example: idioms. Phrases like “The early bird gets the worm” being literally translated would not convey the meaning of the word as well as another similar idiom in Spanish, “A quien madruga, Dios le ayuda”. Another significant hurdle was named entity resolution (NER)—a critical aspect for a service dealing with diverse visual and audio content. NER involves correctly identifying and handling proper nouns, brand names, specific terminology, and culturally significant references across languages. For instance, a stock photo of the Eiffel Tower should retain its name in all languages, rather than being literally translated. Similarly, brand names like Coca-Cola or Nike should remain unchanged, regardless of the target language. This challenge is particularly acute in the realm of creative content. Consider a hypothetical stock image titled Young woman using MacBook in a Starbucks. An ideal translation system would need to do the following: These nuances highlighted the inadequacy of simple machine translation tools and underscored the need for a more sophisticated, context-aware solution. In their quest for a solution, 123RF explored a spectrum of options, each with its own set of trade-offs: This exploration laid bare a fundamental challenge in the AI translation space: the seemingly unavoidable trade-off between cost and quality. High-quality translations from top-tier models were financially unfeasible, whereas more affordable options couldn’t meet the standard of accuracy and consistency that 123RF’s business demanded. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies such as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Throughout this transformative journey, Amazon Bedrock proved to be the cornerstone of 123RF’s success. Several factors contributed to making it the provider of choice: The first breakthrough in 123RF’s translation journey came through a collaborative effort with the AWS team, using the power of Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku. The key to their success lay in the innovative application of prompt engineering techniques—a set of strategies designed to coax the best performance out of LLMs, especially important for cost effective models. Prompt engineering is crucial when working with LLMs because these models, while powerful, can produce non-deterministic outputs—meaning their responses can vary even for the same input. By carefully crafting prompts, we can provide context and structure that helps mitigate this variability. Moreover, well-designed prompts serve to steer the model towards the specific task at hand, ensuring that the LLM focuses on the most relevant information and produces outputs aligned with the desired outcome. In 123RF’s case, this meant guiding the model to produce accurate, context-aware translations that preserved the nuances of the original content. Let’s dive into the specific techniques employed. The team began by assigning the AI model a specific role—that of an AI language translation assistant. This seemingly simple step was crucial in setting the context for the model’s task. By defining its role, the model was primed to approach the task with the mindset of a professional translator, considering nuances and complexities that a generic language model might overlook. For example: A clear delineation between the text to be translated and the instructions for translation was implemented. This separation served two purposes: For example: One of the most innovative aspects of the solution was the implementation of a scratchpad section. This allowed the model to externalize its thinking process, mimicking the way a human translator might work through a challenging passage. The scratchpad prompted the model to consider the following: The team incorporated multiple examples of high-quality translations directly into the prompt. This technique, known as K-shot learning, provided the model with a number (K) of concrete examples in the desired output quality and style. By carefully selecting diverse examples that showcased different translation challenges (such as idiomatic expressions, technical terms, and cultural references), the team effectively trained the model to handle a wide range of content types. For example: The culmination of these techniques resulted in a prompt template that encapsulated the elements needed for high-quality, context-aware translation. The following is an example prompt with the preceding steps. The actual prompt used is not shown here. This template provided a framework for consistent, high-quality translations across a wide range of content types and target languages. Although the initial implementation yielded impressive results, the AWS team suggested further enhancements through dynamic prompting techniques. This advanced approach aimed to make the model even more adaptive and context aware. They adopted the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique for creating a dynamic prompt template with K-shot examples relevant to each phrase rather than generic examples for each language. This also allowed 123RF to take advantage of their current catalog of high quality translations to further align the model. The team proposed creating a vector database for each target language, populated with previous high-quality translations. This database would serve as a rich repository of translation examples, capturing nuances and domain-specific terminologies. The implementation included the following components: This structured approach to storing and retrieving text-translation pairs allowed for efficient, context-aware lookups that significantly improved the quality and relevance of the translations produced by the LLM. The top matching examples from the vector database would be dynamically inserted into the prompt, providing the model with highly relevant context for the specific translation task at hand. This offered the following benefits: The following is an example of a dynamically generated prompt: This dynamic approach allowed the model to continuously improve and adapt, using the growing database of high-quality translations to inform future tasks. The following diagram illustrates the process workflow. How to ground translations with a vector store The process includes the following steps: The impact of implementing these advanced techniques on Amazon Bedrock with Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku and the engineering effort with AWS account teams was nothing short of innovative for 123RF. By working with AWS, 123RF was able to achieve a staggering 95% reduction in translation costs. But the benefits extended far beyond cost savings: The success of this project has opened new horizons for 123RF and set the stage for further advancements: 123RF’s success story with Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic’s Claude is more than just a tale of cost reduction—it’s a blueprint for how businesses can use cutting-edge AI to break down language barriers and truly globalize their digital content. This case study demonstrates the transformative power of innovative thinking, advanced prompt engineering, and the right technological partnership. 123RF’s journey offers the following key takeaways: As we look to the future, it’s clear that the combination of cloud computing, generative AI, and innovative prompt engineering will continue to reshape the landscape of multilingual content management. The barriers of language are crumbling, opening up new possibilities for global communication and content discovery. For businesses facing similar challenges in global content discovery, 123RF’s journey offers valuable insights and a roadmap to success. It demonstrates that with the right technology partner and a willingness to innovate, even the most daunting language challenges can be transformed into opportunities for growth and global expansion.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Black Friday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. The sales start earlier every year, but the best deals are usually seen between Black Friday (November 29) and Cyber Monday (December 2). However, as we head into Black Friday week, we’re already seeing fantastic deals, so you might not want to wait. We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Black Friday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Black Friday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Grab money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are savings on the older models as well: U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds that replaced the AirPods generation 2 and 3 in September. Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. Look out for the Apple Watch Series 9 as there may be some deals on the discontinued model. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. U.K. David Price / Foundry In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. If you see a deal on the any Apple Pencils make sure they work with your iPad! Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29 in 2024) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don’t expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks. You can get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple’s U.S. site or Apple’s U.K. site. Here’s how it compares to last year and the year before. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers. In the U.S., here are the best stores to shop for Black Friday deals: If you’re based in the U.K., you’ll find deals at the following shops: Check out these Lightning tech deals before they go.

Posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber "If these people had to be honest, it would all be over." -- Mike Benz. “Now that our cheques are bouncing and we are starting to default on our debts, our entire civilization appears to be manifesting suicidal behavior in an effort to control the firing squad.” — Luke Dodson. “Joe Biden” is feeling blue. Not a joke. In the lurid sunset of his dwindling term-in-office, the long shadow of his legacy points toward a gigantic glowing cinder where North America used to be. Such are the grievances of the outgoing president. I pass unto you and your legions of white supremacist slobs the ashtray that was once our mighty nation. Fix that! But, as Sir Mick Jagger observed some time ago: you can’t always get what you want. “Joe Biden,” in despair, sinks deeper into his McTeer power recliner and slips back into the bitter dream of his nemesis, a beast named Chrump. . . . It’s such a chewy name: Chrump, a fricative fiesta! The tongue briefly presses against the alveolar ridge before releasing, then curls back, and the jaw opens slightly to form this vowel sound, the lips close to let the sound resonate nasally before releasing air. Chrump Chrump Chrump. Like, what your mouth would feel like working through a bowl of Froot Loops. So satisfying! The outgoing Party of Chaos can’t stop chanting it on the cable news networks, as if trying to invoke the ancient furies, ghastly, terrifying figures with snakes for hair, dogs' heads, blood-red eyes, and bat-wings, brandishing torches and scourges to mortify their enemy. Otherwise, fantasy aside, they are in paralysis as this enemy, Mr. Trump, marshals his pieces on the gameboard: Musk, Vivek, Bobby Jr, Tulsi, Bondi, Hegseth . . . . Ay-yeeeeee! They are coming to get us. . . . Somebody. . . do something. . . ! Okay, then, who, exactly, in the shadows behind the half-conscious ghoul in the White House, thinks that now is a great time to commence an ATACMS (Attack’ems) missile barrage on Russia as the very thing to salvage our Ukraine project? You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber It sure looks like Biden is trying to leave the Donald a little gift of WWIII to deal with so that he won’t have any time to make America great again or any of that nonsense. 2 posted on 11/25/2024 6:46:16 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

Not a joke. In the lurid sunset of his dwindling term-in-office, the long shadow of his legacy points toward a gigantic glowing cinder where North America used to be. Such are the grievances of the outgoing president. I pass unto you and your legions of white supremacist slobs the ashtray that was once our mighty nation. Fix that! But, as Sir Mick Jagger observed some time ago: you can’t always get what you want. “Joe Biden,” in despair, sinks deeper into his McTeer power recliner and slips back into the bitter dream of his nemesis, a beast named Chrump. . . . It’s such a chewy name: Chrump, a fricative fiesta! The tongue briefly presses against the alveolar ridge before releasing, then curls back, and the jaw opens slightly to form this vowel sound, the lips close to let the sound resonate nasally before releasing air. Chrump Chrump Chrump. Like, what your mouth would feel like working through a bowl of Froot Loops. So satisfying!

The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

Not a joke. In the lurid sunset of his dwindling term-in-office, the long shadow of his legacy points toward a gigantic glowing cinder where North America used to be. Such are the grievances of the outgoing president. I pass unto you and your legions of white supremacist slobs the ashtray that was once our mighty nation. Fix that! But, as Sir Mick Jagger observed some time ago: you can’t always get what you want. “Joe Biden,” in despair, sinks deeper into his McTeer power recliner and slips back into the bitter dream of his nemesis, a beast named Chrump. . . . It’s such a chewy name: Chrump, a fricative fiesta! The tongue briefly presses against the alveolar ridge before releasing, then curls back, and the jaw opens slightly to form this vowel sound, the lips close to let the sound resonate nasally before releasing air. Chrump Chrump Chrump. Like, what your mouth would feel like working through a bowl of Froot Loops. So satisfying! The outgoing Party of Chaos can’t stop chanting it on the cable news networks, as if trying to invoke the ancient furies, ghastly, terrifying figures with snakes for hair, dogs' heads, blood-red eyes, and bat-wings, brandishing torches and scourges to mortify their enemy. Otherwise, fantasy aside, they are in paralysis as this enemy, Mr. Trump, marshals his pieces on the gameboard: Musk, Vivek, Bobby Jr, Tulsi, Bondi, Hegseth . . . . Ay-yeeeeee! They are coming to get us. . . . Somebody. . . do something. . . ! Okay, then, who, exactly, in the shadows behind the half-conscious ghoul in the White House, thinks that now is a great time to commence an ATACMS (Attack’ems) missile barrage on Russia as the very thing to salvage our Ukraine project? You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber It sure looks like Biden is trying to leave the Donald a little gift of WWIII to deal with so that he won’t have any time to make America great again or any of that nonsense. 2 posted on 11/25/2024 6:46:16 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence.

The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows.

It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP.

The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict.

Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber It sure looks like Biden is trying to leave the Donald a little gift of WWIII to deal with so that he won’t have any time to make America great again or any of that nonsense. 2 posted on 11/25/2024 6:46:16 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

Think what a horror it would have been if we treated Japan and Germany the same way after World WarII. Our silly spooks would be running scams called 'Japan Japan Japan' to take out Trump... 10 posted on 11/25/2024 8:32:03 AM PST by GOPJ (No law says citizens who think they're GOD, have a right to force us to worship them- same w/trans.)

I should read one because he is an interesting writer. 12 posted on 11/25/2024 9:05:14 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

It sure looks like Biden is trying to leave the Donald a little gift of WWIII to deal with so that he won’t have any time to make America great again or any of that nonsense. Excellent catch on this article. Enjoyed it. I just hope Putin has enough wisdom and maturity to wait this out. He knows joe Biden has just a few weeks left and then a real man takes over. Thank you for posting that. I always enjoy reading Kunstler. I look at this as the Grand Finale of the Smash-n-Grab, at present. I think the Deep State will make things as hard to fix as possible and their attempt is really to make Putin one of them. No more natural gas to Germany. No peaceful commerce with Russia. The danger is that we make this the new normal. The ‘Rats smash everything and steal what they can, and the Pubbies try to clean up the mess. In a sane world, we have until Jan 3rd or 6th and CONgress stays in session to handcuff Bidet and his war whores. I think that to believe Trump and Putin have not spoken is naive. Putin knows that in about 2-3 months he is going to get a great deal of what he wants at the negotiating table. Great article - thank you! Well...I am going to have to read Kunstler stuff more often. Are his novels any good? But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. WOW, just WOW... great stuff. Thanks for posting. Too bad after the fall of the USSR we didn't just invite Russia to join NATO ... much saner solution than to have our CIA decide MAGA and Russians are 'the enemy'...

The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets.

These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.

US stocks climbed on Monday amid high hopes for President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were both up over 1.5% as they crept closer toward the initial levels seen after the election. Trump tapped Bessent, viewed as the "investor favorite" pick for Treasury, late Friday evening after a surprisingly drawn-out process that saw candidates' stock seem to rise and fall by the day. Bessent's nomination has seemed to at least temporarily calm nerves over the president-elect's inflationary agenda, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dipping back to 4.36%. On the inflationary front, the Fed will get its preferred look at the picture heading into Trump's term with Wednesday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. Economists expect a tick up in "core" PCE, which is closely watched by the central bank.

Title: The Coca-Cola Company (KO): A Dividend Powerhouse with Consistent Growth and Strong Cash Flow

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Beverage Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against best beverage stocks that pay dividends. Retail sales rebounded significantly in October as the economy remained stable and consumers overcame worries about a port strike and other challenges that had dampened sales in September, according to the CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor. NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay noted that consumer spending picked up again in October, supported by job growth and increased wages throughout the year. He observed that inflation remained largely confined to services, with prices for some retail goods even declining. Shay indicated that October’s sales performance had laid a solid foundation for the holiday shopping season to begin on a positive note. When we examine specific sectors, we see that grocery and beverage stores experienced a 0.87% increase on a seasonally adjusted month-over-month basis and a 3.76% rise year-over-year without seasonal adjustments. The food and beverage industry faced significant challenges during the pandemic. While in-home consumption surged, out-of-home dining virtually ceased, leading to a substantial decline in business and severely impacting the sector. Since then, the industry has undergone numerous transformations and is now in a recovery phase. According to a Market Research report, the global food and beverages market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% between 2022 and 2027. The market's growth is being driven by shifting consumer habits, out-of-town retail parks, and retail stores. READ ALSO: 7 Best Beverage Stocks that Pay Dividends Coffee remains the most popular beverage among Americans. In 2023, spending on out-of-home cold coffee, such as iced coffee, cold brew, and frozen coffee drinks, reached $17.7 billion—more than double the $8.5 billion spent in 2016, according to the food service research firm Technomic. Additionally, the National Coffee Association (NCA) reported that coffee consumption outside the home has returned to pre-pandemic levels as people resume visiting coffee shops and workplaces. Over a third of consumers who drank coffee on a given day did so away from home, marking the highest rate since January 2020, as highlighted in the NCA's National Coffee Data Trends report. Consumer behavior plays a critical role in shaping any industry, and the beverage sector is no exception. This industry is adapting to evolving preferences, with more Americans seeking alternatives to alcohol. Beverage companies emphasizing the health benefits of their products are striving to tap into this trend. According to data insights firm NCSolutions, over 40% of Americans aim to reduce their alcohol consumption in 2024, an increase from 34% the previous year. Among Generation Z, this figure rises to 61%, compared to 40% in 2023 who expressed similar intentions. Technology stocks have been the standout performers this year, with gains of nearly 29%. While food and beverage stocks haven't seen exceptional growth, the Food & Beverage index, which represents companies across various sub-industries in the sector, has still delivered a modest year-to-date return of 7.5%. Over the past 12 months, the index has risen by approximately 14%. Pixabay/Public Domain To select the best beverage stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked companies that are primarily involved in the production and distribution of a wide variety of liquid refreshments, including soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, bottled water, energy drinks, fruit juices, sports and nutritional drinks, and dairy-based beverages. From that list, we selected 10 companies that pay dividends to shareholders and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 Warren Buffett's favorite, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ranks second on our list of the best beverage stocks that pay dividends. The American multinational beverage company is well-known to consumers, offering a diverse range of drink brands and maintaining a global presence. The company's greatest competitive advantage is its strong brand, which creates an economic moat, helping it stand out from competitors in the industry. In addition to its long history of providing a consistent product, it has developed exceptional marketing expertise, ensuring the brand remains prominent and top-of-mind for consumers. The stock has delivered a nearly 7% return to shareholders since the start of 2024. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) generated nearly $12 billion in revenues in the third quarter of 2024, which beat analysts' consensus by $290 million. The company's cash performance was also strong as it generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter and its free cash flow came in at $1.6 billion. Its adjusted operating margin reached an impressive 30.7% in Q3, reflecting a highly profitable business model. This consistent profitability has directly benefited shareholders, as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has increased its dividend for an astounding 62 consecutive years. It’s rare for investors to find companies with such an exceptional history of returning excess profits to shareholders. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.485 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.04%, as recorded on November 24. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, 69 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), up from 68 in the previous quarter. These stakes are valued at nearly $35 billion in total. With 400 million shares, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company. Overall, KO ranks 2nd on our list of best beverage dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for KO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Elon Musk has big return-to-office plans for federal employees and he’s saying the quiet part out loud

Time Published: 2024-11-25T13:13:25Z

Good morning! The return-to-office debate got a bit spicier last week with Elon Musk’s latest promise to make the government more efficient. In an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal, the billionaire appointed to head up the new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) along with his co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy, laid out plans to reduce the overall size of the government and cut costs. And one part of that blueprint included mandating a full return-to-office for all Federal workers. “Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the COVID-era privilege of staying home,” they wrote. In doing so, Musk and Ramaswamy seem to be openly announcing what some critics have long argued is a disguised impetus behind strict RTO mandates: Job cuts. One survey this year of more than 1,500 U.S. managers found that a quarter of C-suite executives were hoping that return-to-office policies would encourage employees to voluntarily quit. After all, it’s certainly cheaper than having to do layoffs and pay severance. Other CEOs have discussed potential attrition due to five-day RTO mandates. Last month, Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman told staffers during an all-hands meeting that it’s “OK” if people don’t want to work in an office environment because there are “other companies around.” That led many employees to sign an open letter to corporate leadership noting his remarks were “inconsistent with the experiences of many employees” and “misrepresenting the realities of working at Amazon.” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy pushed back against allegations that the company’s RTO requirement was an excuse to lay off workers and said the decision was “not a cost play.” The Federal government is the nation’s largest employer, with over 2.2 million civilian staffers. Until now, each agency has been able to decide what workplace policy works best for them. Of the total number of Federal workers, roughly half work on-site, according to an August report from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. While remaining employees are eligible for remote work, the report found that only 228,000, or roughly 10%, were in remote positions where there was no expectation that they work in-person. And those who have the option to work remotely spent about 60% of working hours in-person at various job sites. It’s unclear if Musk and Ramaswamy will actually be able to implement a five-day RTO for Federal workers. And of course, the question remains: Will these CEOs return to the office themselves? That’s yet to be seen. Brit Morsebrit.morse@fortune.com Today’s edition was curated by Emma Burleigh. A round-up of the most important HR headlines.

Posted on 11/25/2024 4:46:13 AM PST by Timber Rattler One of the bleakest places on Earth today is the central processing facility for the remains of dead soldiers in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, the logistical hub of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Designed to process hundreds of corpses at a time, this sprawling mega-morgue has been hopelessly overwhelmed for many months. Footage from the inside, posted by witnesses on social media, shows hundreds of bodies in various stages of decomposition and limbs strewn across the corridor floors. In wooden boxes lining the walls from floor to ceiling, row after row after row, are the lucky ones: those whose bodies were recovered from the battlefield, identified, sealed in zinc-lined caskets, and prepared for dispatch to their grieving relatives in the farthest corners of Russia. Many more corpses have been abandoned to rot in Ukrainian fields because evacuating them is impractical under the constant barrage of the defenders’ artillery and drones. To be sure: These soldiers’ deaths are the necessary consequence of Ukraine’s right to defend itself against an illegal war of conquest. What’s more, many of these ordinary Russian soldiers likely committed despicable brutality and war crimes against Ukrainians, including defenseless civilians. But the horrific rate at which Russians are getting killed at the front—much higher than corresponding Ukrainian losses, although exact numbers are kept secret by both sides—points to two disturbing truths about the Russian way of waging war. First, a cruel disregard for human life extends to Russia’s own forces, which the Kremlin systematically deploys in so-called meat grinder and human-wave attacks. Second, mass death among Russian troops has become part of an increasingly explicit eugenics policy, by which the Kremlin seeks to rid Russia of undesirable elements and reconfigure the Russian population.

Title: US Supreme Court Permits Multibillion-Dollar Class Action By Investors Against Meta
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2024/11/223-us-supreme-court-permits-multibillion-dollar-class-action-against-meta/

MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India The US Supreme Court has permitted a multibillion-dollar class action lawsuit by investors against Facebookâs parent company, Meta. This has stemmed from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm, reported AP. The justices heard arguments in November regarding Metaâs attempt to dismiss the lawsuit. The Supreme Court dismissed Meta’s appeal, upholding a lower court decision that allowed the case to proceed. Investors claimed that Meta failed to adequately disclose the risks tied to the misuse of Facebook users’ personal data by Cambridge Analytica. The firm allegedly supported Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The investors argue that insufficient disclosures caused two significant declines in Metaâs stock price in 2018. These drops occurred after the public learned the full extent of the privacy breach. Meta had reached a $725 million settlement with users over privacy violations over Cambridge Analytica data leak, reported CNN.Â The Cambridge Analytica scandal highlighted significant privacy concerns, with the firm collecting personal data from millions of Facebook users without consent. The firm, with connections to Trump strategist Steve Bannon, paid a Facebook app developer for access to personal information. This data came from approximately 50 million users. The firm used this data to target U.S. voters during the 2016 election campaign. The now-defunct firm allegedly gathered personal data from numerous users without their consent. A former Cambridge Analytica employee, Christopher Wylie, brought the scandal to light. Wylie disclosed that Cambridge Analytica used this data to build psychographic profiles and influence voters. Wylie described the technology as âSteve Bannonâs psychological warfareâ tool.Â The data was gathered via an app called “This Is Your Digital Life.” Around 270,000 people and used their FB account to login to the app. The app then accessed not only their information but also data from their Facebook friends which resulted in the ballooning of the number of people the app collected data on. Facebook later acknowledged that their policies at the time allowed this. The app asked users a series of questions to construct psychological profiles. These profiles helped identify individuals likely to support their clients. Cambridge Analytica reportedly provided its services to former U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign, using micro-targeting techniques to influence voter behavior. The firm also worked on the Brexit campaign, sparking concerns about the “hijacking” of democracy. âWe were able to get upwards of 50 million-plus Facebook records in the span of a couple of months,â stated Wylie. Facebook responded by suspending accounts related to Cambridge Analytica, its parent company Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), Kogan, and Wylie. The incident sparked global outrage. Similarly, UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham began an inquiry into the misuse of Facebook data. âAny criminal and civil enforcement actions arising from the investigation will be pursued vigorously,â she emphasised. Eventually, a court filing in August 2022 indicated that Facebook had reached a settlement in the Cambridge Analytica privacy lawsuit, reported BBC. The agreement was finalized shortly before the company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, and former COO, Sheryl Sandberg, were scheduled to provide depositions in September 2022. With the settlement in place, the depositions did not proceed. Meta agreed to pay $725 million dollars to resolve the class-action lawsuit.Â In India, Cambridge Analytica reportedly collaborated with political parties for past elections and explored partnerships with both the BJP and Congress for the 2019 general elections.Â Cambridge Analytica and its Indian partner, Oveleno Business Intelligence (OBI) Private Limited, engaged in discussions with both parties for potential collaboration on their campaigns for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Both BJP and Congress denied links with the companies but accused one another of utilizing the services of the company.Â Despite the allegations, the firm and its Indian partner planned to continue their work unless authorities proved that Cambridge Analytica violated Indian laws. âWhat may be illegal and unethical in one place may not be in India and vice versa. So it is too early to say anything,â stated OBIâs CEO Amrish Tyagi.Â Cambridge Analyticaâs website highlighted its involvement in the 2010 Bihar Assembly elections, where it conducted an in-depth electorate analysis. âOur client achieved a landslide victory, with over 90% of total seats targeted by CA being won,â the site claimed. Eventually, India took down the local website for Cambridge Analytica following the allegations against the company, reported BBC.Â Have something to tell us?

Title: Will Trump’s DOJ Dismantle Big Tech Monopolies?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2024/11/25/will-trumps-doj-break-up-the-big-tech-giants/

The Big Tech Titans: Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft face mounting scrutiny as the Trump ... [+] administration's antitrust agenda targets industry monopolies and reshapes the future of technology. November 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice filed its proposed final judgment, recommending sweeping remedies to dismantle Google’s search monopoly. This long-awaited action marks the most significant antitrust move in decades and could become a pivotal moment for Big Tech as President Trump prepares for his second term. At the core of the DOJ’s plan is the requirement for Google to sell its Chrome browser. The proposal also includes a framework for divesting Android if behavioral remedies fail to increase competition. Remedies include banning exclusive default agreements with device makers and prohibiting Google from developing new browsers. Unsurprisingly, Google is pushing back strongly and Google’s chief legal officer Kent Walker called the DOJ’s plan a “radical interventionist agenda,” asserting it goes “miles beyond” the concerns outlined by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who ruled in August that Google held monopolies in two markets. With President Trump back in the White House in January, speculation is mounting over whether his administration will pursue even more drastic actions against Big Tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Apple. Such moves could reshape not only the tech industry but also the global economy. The incoming Trump administration has long signaled an aggressive stance on Big Tech, citing concerns about censorship, market dominance and monopolistic practices. High-profile figures in Trump’s circle, such as former Congressman Matt Gaetz and Vice President J.D. Vance, have long been critics of tech monopolies. Gaetz has focused on perceived censorship of conservative voices, while Vance has called for reforms to rein in monopolistic practices. Pam Bondi, Trump’s new nominee for attorney general, could play a key role in this agenda. Bondi has a notable record of consumer protection and antitrust enforcement, having recovered over $1 billion in such matters as Florida’s attorney general. However, her direct involvement with Big Tech enforcement has been limited. Bondi’s public support for former President Trump’s lawsuit against Facebook, Twitter and Google in 2021 suggests a willingness to challenge Big Tech’s influence but leaves questions about her approach to structural remedies. This momentum aligns with rare bipartisan support, highlighted by the latest action from the DOJ under President Biden. Influential Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have also advocated breaking up Big Tech, arguing that monopolies stifle innovation and harm small businesses. With mounting pressure from both sides of the aisle, Big Tech now faces an unprecedented challenge. The U.S. is not alone in scrutinizing Big Tech. Across the Atlantic, European regulators, led by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, have ramped up investigations. Proposed remedies, such as forcing Google to divest its ad tech business, reflect a global trend toward stricter oversight. European lawmakers like Andreas Schwab advocate robust measures to ensure fair competition and foster innovation. These efforts could inspire similar actions in other jurisdictions, further pressuring U.S.-based tech giants. A breakup of major tech firms could echo past antitrust actions, such as the breakup of AT&T’s Bell System in the 1980s or the case against Microsoft in the 1990s. Here’s a closer look at the likely targets: A breakup of Big Tech could have profound implications for innovation. Large tech companies have been instrumental in advancing cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and sustainable energy solutions. For instance, Microsoft and Amazon have explored nuclear power options to meet the energy demands of AI data centers. Disrupting these corporate giants could slow progress in areas like AI development and power generation, particularly as hyperscalers have the resources to invest in ambitious, long-term projects. However, breaking up Big Tech might also create opportunities for smaller, more agile companies to step up. A less concentrated market could foster competition, enabling a diverse range of businesses to tackle these challenges. This democratization of innovation could lead to creative solutions that were previously overshadowed by Big Tech’s dominance. While the transition could bring short-term disruption, it may ultimately stimulate a more competitive technological landscape. A breakup of Big Tech would create seismic shifts in the industry, presenting both opportunities and challenges: While a breakup is not guaranteed, the bipartisan appetite for antitrust reform and the Trump administration’s rhetoric suggest significant changes are possible. A dismantling of Big Tech could redefine how technology is developed, consumed and regulated in the U.S. and beyond. The stakes are enormous. As the tech industry braces for potential upheaval, businesses, policymakers and consumers must prepare for a future that could look radically different. Whether this transformation fosters a more competitive marketplace—or introduces new challenges—remains to be seen. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Is Uber Technologies (UBER) the Best Stock to Invest in for the Next 3 Months?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies. Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally. First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms. Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers. Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services. Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil. Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies. Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced. On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes. The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

To compile our list of the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank the 12 stocks that are the most popular among elite money managers, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). No. of Hedge Funds: 136 Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a pioneering platform for ride-hailing, food delivery, and freight services, operating in over 70 countries. The company has revolutionized urban mobility, offering convenient and affordable solutions for millions of users. The company’s diversified revenue streams, including Uber Eats and Uber Freight, make it a key player in the future of transportation and delivery services. On October 31, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) announced financial results for the third quarter, which ended on September 30. The company’s revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $11.2 billion. Whereas, Gross Bookings increased 16% year-over-year to $41.0 billion, with trips during the quarter growing 17% year-over-year to 2.9 billion, or approximately 31 million trips per day on average. Looking ahead to Q4, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has issued an optimistic outlook, reflecting strong growth prospects. The company projects Gross Bookings to range between $42.75 billion and $44.25 billion, representing a year-over-year (YoY) increase of 16% to 20%. This growth is expected to be fueled by sustained momentum in both its Mobility and Delivery segments, with trip growth anticipated to mirror the performance observed in Q3. Overall, UBER ranks 9th on our list of best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Investing with a clear conscience: How should Catholics manage their money?

By Jonah McKeown CNA Staff, Nov 25, 2024 / 06:00 am In today’s complex society, it takes effort to ensure that your hard-earned money, once invested and out in the financial ether, doesn’t fund the kinds of things that Catholics abhor — like abortion, pornography, or unethical labor practices. But surely the Church itself, with its significant invested assets, has this figured out already… right? Though the principles behind Catholic investing have been clearly articulated in recent years, sources told CNA that many Catholic entities still have a long way to go to make sure their investments actually align with those principles. Case in point: when Daniel Catone, founder of Arimathea Investing, and his team of financial experts started digging into the finances of Catholic entities who approached them, they discovered something extraordinary — and surprisingly pervasive. Nearly all of their Catholic clients, including many U.S. dioceses, were unwittingly funding — sometimes to the tune of millions of dollars — products and practices that directly contradict the faith. “We have to look at the reality of the choices that we’re making with our dollars, [because] just as Our Lord will call us to account for every careless word that comes from our mouths, so too will the Lord call us to account for every careless dollar that left our wallets,” Catone told CNA. Arimathea is just one of a growing number of Catholic firms seeking to help individuals, ministries, and dioceses align their investment portfolios with the teachings of the Catholic Church, all while seeking competitive financial returns. The Church has weighed in quite comprehensively — and quite recently — on the topic of investing, both at the level of the bishops of the United States in 2021 and at the worldwide level with the 2022 Vatican document Mensuram Bonam. Mensuram Bonam — the title of which means “a good measure” — casts a wide net, exhorting investors to consider the ethics and consequences of their actions, especially how their investment choices will affect the world’s most vulnerable. It emphasizes that Catholic investors should seek not only to avoid harm but also actively promote good. The document identifies a set of core principles for investors rooted in Catholic social teaching. The principles include the recognition of the dignity of every human being; promoting the common good; working in solidarity with the most vulnerable; caring for the environment; and subsidiarity — the idea that decision-making should be done at the most appropriate level. The guidelines also lay out specific exclusionary criteria that Catholic investors need to be aware of and screen for. These include the funding of abortion, armaments, nuclear weapons, contraceptives, embryonic stem cell research, pornography, addictive substances, human rights violations such as breaches of labor laws, corruption, and unfair business practices. The development of Mensuram Bonam was prompted, in part, by a controversy in recent years over the Vatican’s own investments. In April 2021, an Italian investigative news program accused the Vatican’s treasury of investing 20 million euros (then around $24 million) in several pharmaceutical companies involved in making emergency contraception, or the “morning-after pill.” A subsequent 2022 policy was drawn up mandating that the Holy See’s financial investments cannot contradict Catholic teaching. The U.S. Catholic bishops’ “Socially Responsible Investment Guidelines,” released in 2021, applies to the U.S. investment landscape many similar concepts found within the latter-written Mensuram Bonam. (Story continues below) The bishops urge the importance of discerning whether investments will protect human life, which means avoiding any company involved in abortion, euthanasia, and assisted suicide, embryonic stem cell research, human cloning, and other practices the Church teaches to be evil. At the same time, investors must endeavor to promote human dignity and the common good, the bishops wrote. This means Catholic investors should avoid companies known to persistently violate the human rights of their workers or who operate in countries with poor human rights records. Companies with ties to pornography, human trafficking, or a non-Catholic view of gender identity and expression should be avoided, the bishops noted. This also means eschewing investments in certain “harmful habitual behaviors” and “addictive materials” such as gambling, tobacco, and recreational drugs; also firearms, the bishops said, except for legitimate hunting, military, or law enforcement use. At the same time, the bishops urged investors to support positive things such as renewable energy sources; biodiversity and water resources; affordable housing; and, in the face of an often negative outlook from many Hollywood productions, virtuous media that strengthens families and contributes to a more positive and humane culture. After a successful two-decade career in finance overseeing billions of dollars in investments, Catone, who has a master’s degree in theology, went all-in on what he calls “faithful investing.” He founded Arimathea in 2023 as an asset management company that conducts in-depth, tech-forward research to ensure its clients’ portfolios — “dollars meant to be used for the people of God” — are truly Catholic-aligned. By trusting large secular firms like BlackRock or Morgan Stanley to manage their money, many Catholics are unknowingly funding organizations and practices that directly contradict the Church’s teachings, he reiterated, citing Arimathea’s own rigorous research. These include investments in companies like Microsoft, which not only pays for employees’ abortion travel but also has been known to violate workers’ rights in developing countries; other companies that directly cause abortions by distributing Plan B drugs; even companies such as hotel chains that directly profit off the sale of pornography, he said. “I came to the realization that the secular world was, in a way, pulling the wool over the eyes of the Catholic Church. And shocking as this may sound, most people do not become bishops because they’re really good at picking stocks, and so they rely upon the expertise of these secular organizations,” Catone said. He urged Catholics to examine their own investments, such as their 401(k), with a trusted financial adviser. “Step 1 is to stop treating our money as ‘out of sight, out of mind.’ Because the Lord is calling us to live a fully integrated life,” Catone said. “Our Lord Jesus Christ needs to be the Lord of every part of our life … and that also includes our 401(k) and our IRA. So in order to wake up, the first step is to open our eyes … because we can’t repent of what we don’t know.” On Arimathea’s website, Catholics can send their investment portfolio to the company, which will then screen it, for free, offering a kind of “report card” on the ethicality of each investment from a Catholic perspective, Catone noted. He added that Arimathea’s research is informed by a strong understanding of Catholic theology — a rarity among investment firms — as well as what he calls a “literal reading” of the 2021 USCCB document. Arimathea is also working to develop a network of accredited advisers who are trained in the principles of Catholic social teaching and can guide Catholic investors, he said. The goal is not merely to avoid “bad” companies but also actively seek out investments that promote human dignity and the common good, he emphasized. One way to do this is through proxy voting, a tool for influencing corporate behavior and promoting change from within that Catone said can be helpful in pushing companies to adopt more ethical practices. He said Catholics should be actively engaged in trying to improve the companies they invest in and have had some success at that in the past. Catone said the success Arimathea has had financially demonstrates that it is possible to invest in a way that is fully in line with the Catholic faith without sacrificing monetary returns. “What we’re trying to show at Arimathea is you can draw the line ... and say you know what? No abortion, no pornography, no drugs, no slave labor. And you know what? The returns are great,” he concluded. Shane Giblin, CEO of The Abbey Group, told CNA that the cultural milieu following the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade exposed “a bit of a crisis in the area of Catholic investing.” The Abbey Group came about in the late 2010s after St. Michael’s Abbey in Orange County, California, under Giblin’s fundraising leadership, managed to raise $150 million to build a new abbey, far outpacing expectations. They started doing pro bono consulting to help other Catholic entities replicate their success, launching officially in 2020 with a goal to help worthy Catholic causes generate and grow the resources they need to fully live out their mission. The Abbey Group is selective in its projects, evaluating them based on alignment with Catholic teachings, the potential impact of their endeavors, and the strength of their leadership. Giblin said in the wake of Roe’s overturn, the “screens” that were being applied to many Catholic investment portfolios needed to be reevaluated; it wasn’t clear how effective they were, or what they were doing to potentially limit returns, he noted. The other thing that Giblin said he noticed was that many Catholic investors weren’t allocating much to private equity — the buying and selling of shares in privately-held businesses. “What we saw was a great deal of interest and encouragement in creating an alternative investment solution that is authentically Catholic, specifically something in the private equity space,” Giblin said. To address the need, Giblin said Abbey Group Capital has partnered with Carrick Capital Partners, a firm run by a faithful Catholic, to help its clients grow the money they raise — and do so in a way that aligns with the Church’s teachings. The partnership, which benefits from the spiritual guidance from the Norbertine priests at the abbey, ensures investments align with Catholic values, such as avoidance of abortion and positive support for mothers wishing to keep and raise their children, Giblin said. Giblin said he hopes their approach will inspire others in the Catholic community to adopt similar strategies, ultimately contributing to a more dynamic and competitive landscape in Catholic investing. “It seems all too often that the Catholic space has to make the decision between either being excellent or being authentically Catholic. I think that’s a problem that we need to really break ourselves out of, a dynamic we need to run away from, because they’re not mutually exclusive terms,” he said. “I’ve seen a resurgence of late that gives me a lot of hope. I think that people are starting to become far more rigorous and far more attentive to the necessity to steward these resources with a great deal of vigilance when it comes to what they’re investing in and what they’re not investing in.” Richard Todd, CEO of Innovest, a Catholic financial firm based in Colorado that manages about $50 billion, said there was little awareness of the possibility, or even the need, for Catholic-aligned investments back in 1996 when he founded his firm. But that landscape has changed significantly with the rise of large, secular investment firms “taking advantage” of trusting Catholics, he said. “The ‘other side’ has been taking advantage of Catholics for, I would say, probably the last 10 years, but very specifically in the last five,” Todd told CNA. “It used to be, as a Catholic investor, if you owned a company, you could trust management to do what’s right for the company. But it’s no longer the case because of this pressure that these large asset managers are putting on.” Todd said Innovest works with clients to develop customized investment guidelines that reflect their unique values, allowing organizations like dioceses and universities to articulate their specific ethical concerns and ensure that their investment portfolios are truly aligned with their mission. They then design diversified portfolios that include traditional stocks and bonds, along with alternative investments such as real estate, private debt, and private equity. Todd, echoing Catone, emphasized the importance of going beyond simply avoiding harmful investments, emphasizing the importance of seeking out companies that promote positive values. He said Innovest looks for companies that prioritize human flourishing and foster a strong company culture, and also reiterated the importance of Catholics with large investments using proxy voting to influence companies for the better. “Many organizations that are Catholic don’t pay any attention to proxy voting. They end up voting for things that are completely outside their values, outside Catholic values. We believe that understanding how proxies are voted is really crucial,” he said. He noted that a popular framework of values-based investing, environmental, social, and governance (ESG), also known as impact investing, can include elements that are “anti-Christian” or misaligned with Catholic values. He said he seeks to educate clients on the differences between secular investing, ESG, and Catholic investing. Like Giblin, Todd said he firmly believes that investors do not have to sacrifice financial returns to invest in alignment with Catholic values. He pointed to the rise of competent asset managers who are adept at managing Catholic-values portfolios while achieving market-competitive or even superior results compared with secular portfolios. “I think, though, that there are [still] very few in the Catholic world that think this way. I think we’re in the first inning,” Todd said. “There are some, I think, that are moving in this direction that are prominent and well known. Our hope is that their courage will help lead others to really take a serious look at the way they manage their money. But there’s a lot to be done.” Your monthly donation will help our team continue reporting the truth, with fairness, integrity, and fidelity to Jesus Christ and his Church.

Title: Wall Street Embraces MBS’s Money Man

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access After the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, business leaders made a show of shunning Saudi Arabia, doing deals only behind closed doors. Now it’s all out in the open. On November 14, Wall Street feted Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the head of Saudi Arabia’s nearly $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund and a close confidante of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (MBS). At Cipriani—a private members’ club at 55 Wall Street—bright flowers at the center of the tables matched the ruby-red drapes. This gala, thrown by the Business Council for International Understanding, was a mark of the massive volume of Saudi investment capital percolating through the American economy. That itself isn’t new, but in recent years it’s become clear that the shame associated with Saudi funding in the wake of the grisly 2018 murder and dismemberment of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi has faded. Few seemed to even notice that the governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund—which a Senate subcommittee is currently investigating for undue foreign influence in the fund’s seemingly hostile takeover of the PGA golf Tour—was receiving an award in Manhattan. On stage in Cipriani’s Greek revival ballroom, the president of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, presented Al-Rumayyan with a large crystal paperweight. Sitting with them at the long head table was HuffPo founder Arianna Huffington, and among the hundreds of minglers making their way through the room were hedge-fund titan Ray Dalio, Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel, former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. The evening’s theme—“Champions of Change: Values in Practice”—couldn’t have been more incongruous for Al-Rumayyan, the billionaire lieutenant to one of the world’s most brutal rulers. (I had hoped to attend in person to investigate whether anyone there had qualms about honoring MBS’s money man. Sadly, I was told that the proceedings were closed to journalists.) But the whole event managed to avoid greater scrutiny because Saudi power in the United States, under successive presidents, has become so normalized. In 2023 alone, the Public Investment Fund spent $31.6 billion worldwide, and it currently holds about $20 billion worth of US stocks. Beyond its vanity projects like the futuristic city of Neom or its gifting of $2 billion to Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, PIF is planning a staggering $40 billion AI fund. Meanwhile, its venture capital arm has doled out about $3 billion a year to Wall Street stalwarts and the entire universe of private equity and venture capital firms powering Silicon Valley. “There’s no distinction between the [Saudi fund’s] money and the de facto ruler, who is Mohammed bin Salman,” Hala Aldosari, a Saudi activist living in exile in the US, told me. This is not just a Trump phenomenon. President Joe Biden’s about-face—capped by fist-bumping MBS on a visit to the kingdom in 2022 that broke with his campaign pledge to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah”—explicitly gave American business permission to go all in. Since Israel launched its war on Gaza, the Biden administration has further revived MBS’s global stature and tamped down its already muted human rights rhetoric. As Aldosari put it, “It’s going to get worse with Trump now, but in terms of US foreign policy in the Middle East, it’s very much problematic regardless of the political party.” In anticipation, many American and international companies are already expanding their dealings in Saudi Arabia. Even the consultancy founded by the late Madeleine Albright, which long held itself out as a values-driven firm, just opened a headquarters in Riyadh. In Saudi Arabia, basic freedoms have not improved since Khashoggi was lured inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and murdered. The regime’s crackdown on women’s rights activists has accelerated. “It’s the worst we’ve ever seen,” Aldosari says. Prison sentences are getting longer even for relatively low-profile cases, as part of what she calls the regime’s “systematic approach” to snuffing out dissent. She cited two women recently prosecuted for their tweets, notably Nourah al-Qahtani, who was jailed for 45 years and Salma al-Shehab, who received 34 years. Plus, earlier this year, a Saudi cartoonist named Al-Hazza was sentenced to 23 years. In a new report, Human Rights Watch documents how the Public Investment Fund has enabled internal clampdowns in Saudi Arabia. Drawing upon newly released court documents, Human Rights Watch notes that Al-Rumayyan was a key figure in the 2017 Ritz roundup in which 200 wealthy Saudi royals and businesspeople were detained and blackmailed in the luxury hotel in Riyadh. While it’s tough to get American business to care about issues of global human rights, the risks inherent in working in an autocracy might get their attention. Human Rights Watch details how the state has repeatedly expropriated the assets of people and companies, without due process. One Saudi entrepreneur based in the US (who would speak to me only on the condition of anonymity) emphasized that Western corporations that engage with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund are exposed to financial as well as reputational risks. “By associating with a fund connected to human rights abuses, they face increasing backlash from investors, consumers, and global stakeholders demanding ethical accountability,” he told me. “The absence of reliable dispute resolution mechanisms in Saudi Arabia leaves companies vulnerable to arbitrary practices, such as unjust expropriations, without any credible options for redress.” But investment capital apparently remains in short supply, and Al-Rummayan’s sovereign wealth purse holds $925 billion. (He also chairs the national oil company, Saudi Aramco.) In the months following Khashoggi’s assassination, business and finance leaders only quietly sealed deals with Saudi Arabia; now it’s out in the open. The Ritz Carlton, the site of MBS’s five-star detention facility, is once again home to big business. In late October, a think tank connected to Al-Rumayyan’s sovereign wealth fund hosted its annual summit in Riyadh, known as Davos in the Desert. In the room were billionaires Dalio, Larry Fink, Ken Griffin, Marc Rowan, Eric Schmidt, and Steve Schwarzman. Elon Musk, who has also benefited from Saudi financial largesse, took the time to appear by video. The public panels focused on innovation and financial trends while studiously avoiding politics, yet there were, as ever, moments that revealed why they had really gathered in Saudi Arabia. David Rubenstein, the Carlyle billionaire who as recently as last year played host to the Biden family for Thanksgiving at his Nantucket retreat, has become a regular of these Saudi events. Moderating a panel, Rubenstein began by flattering the host—or perhaps calling the event for what it is. “Let me ask Yasir,” Rubenstein began, “is the biggest problem with being the governor of the PIF fund that you don’t have enough requests for money?” Al-Rumayyan laughed, but the numbers are nothing to joke about. Attendees told The New York Times that just a small check from him could amount to $100 million. The Saudi fund’s venture arm notes on its website 143 startups, investment funds, and real estate companies that it’s currently backing. Among those listed: Rowan’s Apollo, Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors, and Schwarzman’s Blackstone. Fink’s BlackRock received $5 billion from the PIF for a new investment platform. PIF says that $70 billion of agreements were inked at the October confab, including a partnership between the Saudi fund and Google Cloud to “advance AI research in Arabic-language models,” according to the company. Its president and chief investment officer, Ruth Porat, sat on the panel with Al-Rumayyan in Riyadh. A few weeks later, the Google executive presented him with the Eisenhower Award for Global Transformation in New York, for “values in practice.” But what values does Saudi investment represent beyond the value of money? Q&A / John Nichols Books & the Arts / Zoe Adams John Nichols Books & the Arts / David A. Bell Expect to see more of the Saudi sovereign-wealth kingmaker. Days later at Madison Square Garden, Al-Rumayyan chatted with President-elect Trump at an Ultimate Fighting Championship match, with Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy nearby. It’s likely that in Trump’s second term there will be many more galas for Al-Rumayyan, with a full state visit for MBS on the horizon. We now confront a second Trump presidency. There’s not a moment to lose. We must harness our fears, our grief, and yes, our anger, to resist the dangerous policies Donald Trump will unleash on our country. We rededicate ourselves to our role as journalists and writers of principle and conscience. Today, we also steel ourselves for the fight ahead. It will demand a fearless spirit, an informed mind, wise analysis, and humane resistance. We face the enactment of Project 2025, a far-right supreme court, political authoritarianism, increasing inequality and record homelessness, a looming climate crisis, and conflicts abroad. The Nation will expose and propose, nurture investigative reporting, and stand together as a community to keep hope and possibility alive. The Nation’s work will continue—as it has in good and not-so-good times—to develop alternative ideas and visions, to deepen our mission of truth-telling and deep reporting, and to further solidarity in a nation divided. Armed with a remarkable 160 years of bold, independent journalism, our mandate today remains the same as when abolitionists first founded The Nation—to uphold the principles of democracy and freedom, serve as a beacon through the darkest days of resistance, and to envision and struggle for a brighter future. The day is dark, the forces arrayed are tenacious, but as the late Nation editorial board member Toni Morrison wrote “No! This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak, we write, we do language. That is how civilizations heal.” I urge you to stand with The Nation and donate today.

Title: What Wall Street Analysts Think of Dell's Stock Ahead of Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-wall-street-analysts-think-of-dell-stock-ahead-of-earnings-8750466
Time Published: 2024-11-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Dell (DELL) is set to report third-quarter earnings after the market closes Tuesday, with analysts anticipating sales and profit gains from the year prior, but little further appreciation for the stock. Of the 10 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha, eight have a "buy" or equivalent rating, compared to two "hold" ratings. However, their consensus price target of $145 would imply less than 1% upside from Friday's closing price. Wall Street expects Dell to report third-quarter revenue of $24.68 billion, an 11% rise year-over-year, and net income of $1.02 billion or $1.42 per share, up from $1 billion or $1.36 per share a year ago. Morgan Stanley analysts told clients in a note Thursday they “don’t expect much upside” from Dell’s third-quarter earnings, but suggested the company could see more growth in 2025 from artificial intelligence (AI) servers. Dell makes servers that utilize Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips, drawing a shoutout from the chipmaker in its earnings call Wednesday. For now, results could be hindered by “sub-seasonal PC market trends” and “flattish” quarter-over-quarter AI server growth, the analysts said. Morgan Stanley holds an “overweight” rating and $154 price target for Dell. Dell shares have gained nearly 90% since the start of the year, at $144.21 as of Friday's close.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Trending on Financial Media. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are trending on financial media. The AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Private equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018. The private equity firm has tried twice to get the memory chipmaker listed on the stock exchange, once in 2018 and then again earlier this year.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

The advisory cites the recent movement in the shares for the downgrade. It also lowered margin assumptions for fiscal 2026 to reflect management guidance of lower margins due to Blackwell products. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are trending on financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The hedge fund manager takes a piece of a popular consumer brand. Today, Millennium has over $70 billion in assets under management and is one of the world's largest hedge funds. Investors should understand that Millennium is a "pod shop," which means it allocates capital to different teams (or "pods") that all have their own strategies and a lot of autonomy. In the third quarter, Millennium sold large portions of its stakes in artificial intelligence (AI) companies Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) and bought a new stock that Wall Street thinks can soar. Broadcom isn't the only way to tap the AI revolution. There are currently eight publicly traded companies with market caps of $1 trillion or more: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), the world's biggest retailer and the largest company in the world by revenue, has quietly blown away the rest of the retail sector in recent years as its commitment to omnichannel sales and reputation for everyday low prices have delivered steady growth. Walmart reported another round of strong quarterly results on Tuesday morning. Microsoft and Broadcom are more stable long-term AI plays. Markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving. Earnings from retailers and October inflation data will be the week's highlights. On the surface, Boeing (NYSE: BA) looks as though it has all the ingredients of a potential millionaire-maker investment. The aircraft market is growing, competition is minimal, and government contracts are plentiful. The phrase "economic moat" -- popularized by investing legend Warren Buffett -- refers to certain types of durable competitive advantages a company can possess that make it difficult for potential rivals to make inroads against it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) did it again. Shares pulled back slightly on the news as investors have gotten accustomed to the chip titan regularly besting expectations, and some analysts wanted to see stronger fourth-quarter guidance, which called for $37.5 billion in revenue -- a 70% increase from the quarter a year ago. At the time of this writing, Nvidia is now worth $3.5 trillion. One FAANG stock was unceremoniously left out of the "Magnificent Seven." That was a costly blunder.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against the other AI stocks that are on Wall Street's Radar. Latest reports from tech news platform TechCrunch indicate that MatX, a chip-design startup focused on supporting large language models, has raised $80 million in a funding round. This follows the $25 million seed round it held less than a year ago. The latest round, led by Spark Capital, values the company at a pre-money valuation in the mid-$200 million range and a post-money valuation in the low $300 million range, per TechCrunch. MatX was co-founded two years ago by former Google TPU team members Mike Gunter and Reiner Pope, who aim to address the global shortage of AI-specific chips.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) stands against the other real estate and realty stocks. As reported by Realtor, America’s newly elected president Trump has blamed illegal immigration for the country’s housing affordability crisis since these immigrants are in the race for an already short supply of homes and hence, plans to do the largest deportation operation in American history. It is important to consider that the recent post-pandemic surging home prices started off before the illegal immigration levels climbed. Furthermore, Realtor.com senior economist Ralph McLaughlin referred to this move as something that would create negative consequences for the housing market by stating: “In the short run, reducing immigration could severely hurt the labor supply needed for new homebuilding since up to a third of residential construction employment consists of foreign-born workers” Simultaneously, Trump wants to cut regulations and permit requirements that add unnecessary costs to new homes. Regarding this, economists believe that although reduced regulations might lower homebuilding costs, they would neither solve the entire housing crisis nor fulfill Trump’s dream of cutting the cost of a new home in half by eliminating regulations. Mortgage rates are directly tied to 10-year Treasury bond yields which tend to grow with investors forecasting stronger economic growth and higher inflation. According to Mortgage News Daily, the 30-year fixed mortgage rates briefly rose, settling at 6.98% following Trump’s victory. Despite two rate cuts by the Fed, the rate has surged by almost 1% since the month of September. Trump has also stated his enthusiasm related to somehow lowering mortgage rates, without a clear mechanism unveiled as of yet. Economists and analysts believe that the President’s economic agenda could potentially lead to a surge in mortgage rates. Trump has plans to reduce tax rates, impose tariffs on foreign goods, and ease regulations, policies that are going to lead to a rise in inflation and government debt, which is going to drive up the interest rates and mortgage rates. Before the elections, 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists agreed that Trump's policies would fuel inflation, calling Joe Biden's economic agenda vastly superior to Donald Trump's. Doug Bauer, CEO of Tri Pointe Homes, joined CNBC to discuss what’s next for the US housing market. He sees the lower corporate tax and the easing of regulations for banks as positives. With banks being encouraged to put dollars into all businesses especially the land and land development business to small and medium-sized builders, it is going to help the industry as a whole. Regarding the deportation, he believes the discussion is pretty early but his company, as a larger builder, has not faced any problems on the labor side of the equation. Finally, he mentioned that the core issue remains the supply. While a reduction in interest rates would unlock the resale market, the new homebuilding is a 'state and local issue' as there are a lot of regulations pulling back the land that could be utilized to build affordable housing. Ivy Zelman, Zelman and Associates CEO, also appeared on an interview with CNBC, to reiterate Bauer’s point about the issue regarding the new home market. In her opinion, the housing market weakness is at the entry level while the move-up market remains strong and resilient despite rates moving higher. While first-time homebuyers are facing extreme affordability issues, she thinks cities and municipalities could partner with local builders to utilize land that’s not out so far in the rural areas and that the solution lies at the local government level. Trump also plans to open up federal land for building. However, a limitation of this would be a lack of federal land located near the places where people wish to work and live.

The firm offers services and solutions to deploy and support wireless networks in 24 countries across six continents. It has a portfolio of independently owned US and international tower real estate and a network of data centers in the US. AMT’s customers include mobile network operators, multinational telecommunications companies, media and broadband providers, and government agencies. The ongoing exponential growth in mobile data consumption has driven AMT’s performance in the US. The company’s performance is backed up by the strong underlying demand for its portfolio of communications assets. Its synergy revolves around having that global expertise and experience enabling it to navigate operational risks in new markets while simultaneously creating opportunities. With a resilient demand and strength of underlying fundamentals across the portfolio, AMT is well positioned. The company is pursuing long-term growth by managing its diverse markets. AMT has planned to reduce its exposure to emerging markets which are more vulnerable to the macro environment as the firm continues to focus on incremental investments in developed economies. In September, AMT closed the sale of operations in India to Data Infrastructure Trust, an Infrastructure Investment Trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management. For the third quarter of 2024, the firm’s total revenue grew by less than 0.1% to $2,522 million while net income and adjusted EBITDA declined. As emphasized by CEO Steven Vondran, the carrier rollouts of 5G coverage tend to support robust activity levels in the United States and Europe while demand for AMT’s global portfolio of communications infrastructure assets is evident. Hence, American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is a leading independent owner, operator, and developer of multi-tenant communications real estate, having a solid portfolio of over 148,000 communications sites and a highly interconnected footprint of US data center facilities. Overall AMT ranks 1st on our list of the best real estate and realty stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AMT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Two missions launched in less than 24 hours from two pads in two different hemispheres, setting a new company record for fastest launch turnaround. MAHIA, New Zealand--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (Rocket Lab or the Company), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 56th Electron mission, deploying five satellites to Low Earth Orbit for French Internet-of-Things (IoT) constellation operator KinÃ©is. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241124966388/en/ Rocket Lab's Electron rocket lifts off the pad at Launch Complex 1 to deploy satellites to orbit for French constellation operator KinÃ©is. The launch was the company's second in less than 24 hours. Image credit: Rocket Lab and Rory Gannaway The Ice AIS Baby mission lifted-off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand at 4:55 pm on 25 November NZDT (03:55 UTC), successfully deploying five satellites to a 643 km low Earth orbit. The mission was Rocket Lab's 14th mission of 2024 and 56th launch overall. It also brought the total count of satellites deployed by Rocket Lab to 203, further cementing Electron's position as the leading small launch vehicle globally. The launch took place just 21 hours and 55 minutes after Rocket Lab completed a successful mission from Launch Complex 2 in Virginia, setting a new company record for fastest turnaround between launches. Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck said: Two successful launches less than 24 hours apart from pads in different hemispheres. That's unprecedented capability in the small launch market and one we're immensely proud to deliver at Rocket Lab. Customers like KinÃ©is are unlocking the potential of space and we're excited to give them the keys to do so with frequent, dedicated, and reliable small launch opportunities. KinÃ©is CEO Alexandre Tisserant, says: The KinÃ©is teams have once again demonstrated their technical capabilities as satellite operators by taking control of these five new satellites at a sustained launch rate. This achievement would not have been possible without Rocket Lab's Electron precision in placing our satellites in their planned positions. With 15 KinÃ©is satellites now in orbit, we're one step closer to the full deployment of our dedicated IoT constellation for transmitting data in near-real time, anywhere on the globe. Congratulations to all our teams, who are doing an incredible job - and, let's not forget, a European first! We're equally enthusiastic about our second mission, AIS. In a rapidly consolidating market, KinÃ©is is establishing itself as a sovereign European player, combining technological expertise and strategic independence. With our new AIS offering, we provide maritime players with enhanced visibility over their fleets, while ensuring higher data reliability. The Ice AIS Baby mission was the third of five dedicated Electron launches for KinÃ©is, a company backed by private and public investors including the French government's space agency CNES (Centre National d'Ã‰tudes Spatiales) and CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites), an international space-based solutions provider, to improve global IoT connectivity. The KinÃ©is constellation is designed to make it possible to connect and locate any connected object anywhere in the world, enabling data transmission to users in near-real time, at low bit rates and with very low energy consumption. By enabling internet connection to the Earth's most remote locations, KinÃ©is constellation can support forest fire detection, water resource management, infrastructure and energy network monitoring, transport and logistics tracking, and much more.

Title: Examining Nancy Pelocy's Selling on Google and More

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In an efficient market, it is believed that everyone has equal information, nonetheless the way the market interprets and reacts to the information may vary. But the market speculated that maybe Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman who's been one of the most active traders in Capitol Hill, has more knowledge than the rest of us regarding to investments. Nancy Pelosi is a democrat politician and a representative fom California and she was known to sell part her Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stocks inr December 2022, only a month before the DOJ came out with its antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's advertising practices in January 2023. The timing of Pelosi's stock sale and the DOJ's lawsuit caught people's attention that maybe she had prior knowledge of the lawsuit. Well, the lawsuit was initially filed in October 2020. The DOJ accused Google running monopoly practices over the online search. The lawsuit was then developed in January 2023 targeting Google's digital advertisingpractices. And now in 2024 the DOJ proposed a remedy to Google to sell its web browser Chrome. This is one of the most significant antitrust cases against technology company after Microsoft's case in the late 1990s. As this case resurface, people in many investing forums are buzzing about Pelosi's Google stock sale that occurred just a month prior to the DOJ's second lawsuit. She might be a prominent political figure, and her influence in policy and funding decisions may affect the DOJ's operations, but she has no direct hand in determining DOJ's decisions. Nancy Pelosi as Investment Guru? Let's admit it, she's good with her investments with impressive gains in her portfolio. In 2023 alone her portfolio earned her a staggering $43 million and already accumulated $23 million in profits since the beginning of 2024. Maybe she has more knowledge than most market participants or she just simply good with her investment screening? Let's take a look at her portfolio and track her trading activity a little closer. Gurufocus has Politician Trading Tracker feature (that I just discover recently), and Nancy Pelosi is in the politician list. Her most recent transaction was on July 26, 2024 she purchased shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and now the price is already 24% higher than her purchase price. On the display we also can see that she exited fully on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on June 24, 2024 and the price closed on the date at $182.58 per share. Just for your information she bought Tesla on March 18, 2022 at $301 per hare, that means she lost. And now Tesla's current price is $352.26 per piece. If our assumption that she knew something outside us; the commoners, then she exiting on certain stock must be anticipated. Turns out, her selling on Tesla break the assumption. And after Nvidia, she also sold partially her Microsoft and Visa shares in July 2024. While the price of Microsoft oscillated under the range of $410s- to 420s, Visa now has moved 14% higher since July. And look at the two option calls that she did on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Palo Alto Network (NASDAQ:PANW). See the strike price; $800 for AVGO to be exercised on June 20, 2025? Wow! That's aggressive, 487% higher from AVGO's current price! Meanwhile, she did a good job with PANW, she sets the call's strike price at $200, where today's price for PANW is $383. The exercise price was set on January 17, 2025. Looking at her decisions; bought NVDA, sold partially MSFT and V, and her two options calls, maybe she really does her homework, she screens and stockpicks with not much whispers from the DOJ, or any other government bodies. Unlike the DOJ that against Google's dominance, I'm a big fan of Google's web browser Chrome and the fact that Google dominates the world is something that doesn't bother me. Her timing of exiting Google caught my attention too. But other than Google, her investment decision is much like us the commoners; some end up well and some fail. Again, maybe she's just a common investor (with power in the congress) and do things like any of us do; screen and stockpick in good old-fashioned way. What do you think?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates You Can’t Miss This Weekend. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against other AI news updates you can’t miss this weekend. The race to get ahead in artificial intelligence is compelling companies to intensify their efforts each day. In latest news, ChatGPT creator OpenAI has been considering developing its own web browser, according to a report by The Information. The report reveals that the company has spoken about the product with websites such as Redfin, Conde Nast, Priceline, and Eventbrite. Having already entered the market with SearchGPT, the move would be placing OpenAI head-to-head with Google, the company that holds the major share of the browser and search market. READ ALSO: 10 AI News Stories You Can’t Miss and 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now However, the company isn’t just delving into search and browsers. According to Tech Crunch, OpenAI is also researching algorithms that can predict human being’s moral judgments. OpenAI gave a grant to Duke University researchers for a project called “Research AI Morality.” When asked for more details, an OpenAI spokesperson referred to a press release stating that the grant is part of a larger $1 million, three-year funding effort for Duke Professors working on creating “moral AI.” As per the press release, the OpenAI-funded project aims to develop algorithms capable of “predicting human moral judgments” when moral conflicts arise in fields like medicine, law, and business. However, it isn’t clear yet whether such kind of an achievement is possible with the current levels of technology. In other news, AI firm Anthropic is getting another funding boost. Amazon is increasing its investment in Anthropic to $8 billion, strengthening its partnership in artificial intelligence, the companies announced Friday, the 22nd. “We’ll keep pushing the boundaries of what customers can achieve with generative AI technologies.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). lassedesignen/Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is a global energy company and a soaring AI stock driven by the demand for energy to power artificial intelligence technology. On November 21, Wells Fargo analyst Michael Blum initiated coverage of the power-generation technology company with an “Overweight” rating and a $385 price target. This is the second-highest price target listed by FactSet, as reported by Barrons. According to Blum, GE Vernova can help meet the massive energy demands from artificial intelligence through its power generation and grid products. Blum further states that GE Vernova’s transformers, HVDC, and grid software offerings are well-positioned to benefit from growing power demand. “As power demand grows and more distributed generation is added to the mix, aging grids will require significant investment to manage the increasingly complex and dynamic environment,” Blum said. “GEV’s transformers, HVDC [High-voltage direct current], and grid software offerings are well positioned to benefit from this growing demand”. Overall, GEV ranks 2nd on our list of AI news updates you can’t miss this weekend. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(Photo by Kim Kulish/Corbis via Getty Images) Will Nvidia’s growth rate keep slowing down? If so, investors may be wise to take their profits. However, if the AI chip designer’s new products spur faster growth, now might be a buying opportunity. Stock prices rise when companies exceed investor expectations and raise guidance, while they drop if companies fall short on either one. Nvidia is no exception to this rule. To justify buying Nvidia stock now that it’s the most valuable company in the world — having enjoyed a 195% rise in its share price to a market capitalization of $3.5 trillion this year — you must believe the company will keep beating and raising. If Nvidia significantly exceeds conservative growth targets with help from Blackwell, the stock could rise despite slowing revenue growth, dependence on a few large customers, and the absence of a killer app to deliver a return on the rising investment needed to train and operate AI chatbots. Nvidia stock presents investors with significant risks. These include the following: My guess is investors are baking all these negatives into their expectations. Indeed, despite Nvidia’s slowing growth in 2024, the company’s stock has continued to rise. This could be because the company did a good job of lowering investors’ growth expectations to date. Positive surprises to growth would keep Nvidia stock rising. Huge orders for the company’s latest chip line by the largest AI service providers — coupled with growing corporate interest in applying AI to make processes more efficient — could provide investors with unexpected good news. Here’s how: Until Nvidia can unlock faster-than-expected growth, its stock could be stuck in a trading range. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: After Nvidia earnings, is the AI trend still investors’ friend?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception. In 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the "Magnificent Seven." And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top. A quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it’s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips. Its most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday. There’s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings. But when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains — a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period — weren’t what they used to be. Nvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023. AI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware. “We are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,” Creative Strategies director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report. On the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they’re spending on AI hardware. Nvidia’s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer’s Jacob Bourne. “Critical questions around Blackwell’s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,” Bourne said in a note. “There’s little room for execution missteps in 2025.” There is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump’s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs. For the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%. That said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter. Of course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings. Check out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance The bigger question is whether AI will transform computing over the long term or whether it’s just another investing trend.

Title: Mizuho Raises NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Price Target to $175, Reaffirms Outperform Rating Amid Strong AI Market Leadership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. Data centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe’s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 21, Mizuho raised the price target on the stock to $175 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after the company reported a strong October-end quarter sales result of $35.1 billion and guided January-end quarter revenue to $37.5 billion, which the advisory notes was in line with consensus at $37 billion, but below buy-side estimates of $39 billion-plus. The advisory, which says Nvidia remains a Mizuho 2024 Top Pick and is leading the AI accelerator market, recommends investors buy the pullback. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Washington Post has descended into a dark abyss - here’s why

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/24/2024 3:42:15 AM PST by Libloather The Washington Post used to be one of the best gigs in journalism. No longer. In a business where it generally sucks to be an employee (except for the NY Post, of course), the “WaPo,” as it is known in journalism circles, has really descended into the abyss, On The Money has learned. Top reporters want out of what they see as crappy new work conditions and possibly more layoffs coming. It’s a shame, of course. The paper and its journalists — think Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and their dogged pursuit of Watergate — set the gold standard for reporting. They are the reason so many went into the business, including yours truly. Sure, Woodward remains at the paper, as do many amazing reporters. But the decline of print as a viable business model, plus the leftward lurch of a new generation of ink-stained wretches that turns off readers, has decimated readership — and the paper’s balance sheet. The Post changed hands years ago from the Graham family to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He’s one of the world’s richest men, but he hates losing money, people who know him tell On The Money. That includes the tens of millions a year he’s sinking into the paper. Bezos brought in new management this year like publisher Will Lewis, a WSJ alum (the WSJ and the NY Post share common ownership), to de-woke the place and help it at the very least break even. But it’s either not working or not working well enough to satisfy Bezos’ desire to stop throwing good money after bad, people close to him say. That’s why in addition to financial discipline (some recent layoffs, and possibly more in the future), Lewis is demanding some personal discipline as well. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

The WaPo ignored and refused to publish information that would put Nixon in a favorable light.

It’s a shame, of course. The paper and its journalists — think Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and their dogged pursuit of Watergate — set the gold standard for reporting. They are the reason so many went into the business, including yours truly. Sure, Woodward remains at the paper, as do many amazing reporters. But the decline of print as a viable business model, plus the leftward lurch of a new generation of ink-stained wretches that turns off readers, has decimated readership — and the paper’s balance sheet. The Post changed hands years ago from the Graham family to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He’s one of the world’s richest men, but he hates losing money, people who know him tell On The Money. That includes the tens of millions a year he’s sinking into the paper. Bezos brought in new management this year like publisher Will Lewis, a WSJ alum (the WSJ and the NY Post share common ownership), to de-woke the place and help it at the very least break even. But it’s either not working or not working well enough to satisfy Bezos’ desire to stop throwing good money after bad, people close to him say. That’s why in addition to financial discipline (some recent layoffs, and possibly more in the future), Lewis is demanding some personal discipline as well. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

One thing I hate about The Washington Post is I can never read their articles when I do find one I’m interested in. So I skip them. Let all their activist reporters figure it out when they get cut to the wind. I look forward when these self-important, know it all leftists and their gigs go bye bye. Bye bye MSNBC. Bye bye Washington Post. You peed the bed. Have fun laying in it.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. Cars with a manual transmission now make up a tiny share of autos sold in the US. An updated Porsche 911 Carrera is a reminder of how fun they can be, says BI's chief car reviewer. On the agenda today: But first: Look out, government workers. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. For a minute there, working for the government was in vogue. TikTok videos espoused the benefits of #publicsector jobs, and Google searches for "how to get a government job" hit a five-year high. Younger workers, in particular, were drawn to employment considered less vulnerable to layoffs. Then Elon Musk arrived on the scene. The Department for Government Efficiency, co-headed by Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, has outlined plans to slash federal jobs. DOGE will work with agency appointees to find the minimum number of employees required to perform its functions, per the duo. That has some government workers on edge. (You can see where the most federal staffers work and how much they're paid here.) Several careers consultants told Business Insider they were already experiencing a rush of demand from workers ready to shift to the private sector. Laura Labovich, CEO of The Career Strategy Group, told BI that these workers weren't complaining about their promotion prospects or compensation, as they might have in the past. "They just say, 'I want to leave,'" she said. Comcast, one of the biggest cable TV companies in the US, announced plans to split off almost all of its cable TV networks — CNBC, MSNBC, USA, and a few digital assets — but keep the rest of its media business, including Peacock, NBC, and Bravo. The move further cements the decline of cable, as the number of people paying for and watching these networks is falling every year, BI's Peter Kafka writes. More on the big break up. Also read: By all the standard economic measures, America's labor market looks fine. But ask any white-collar professional, and they'll tell you a horror story that would prove otherwise. Hiring has held up well for low-earning workers, but those making six figures or more are in the midst of a white-collar recession. New data from LinkedIn, which tracked how often its users landed new jobs, shows that tech jobs in particular have been among the hardest hit. More on who's being affected by the hiring slump. Your age probably says a lot about how you remember TGI Fridays. The restaurant chain began as a singles bar in the '60s, and then it evolved into a family-friendly spot in the '80s and '90s. Now, it's a place no one really wants to go. Fridays closed 36 underperforming corporate-owned restaurants at the beginning of the year and recently filed for bankruptcy. Its slow decline and accelerated crash is a familiar story for many restaurant chains. Why casual dining went bust. Amazon's voice assistant became something of a household icon when it launched a decade ago. But maintaining that success has proved difficult. Now, the company is trying to save Alexa with an AI-powered upgrade and improved capabilities. Partnerships with Uber and Ticketmaster were supposed to make Alexa smarter — but issues have delayed the upgrade's release. Are you there, Alexa? This week's quote: "Chrome has served Google exceptionally well, but its loss would be a manageable inconvenience." — Teiffyon Parry, chief strategy officer at adtech company Equativ, on the DOJ's request that Google sell off Chrome. More of this week's top reads: Shoppers are buying like it's 2008, Ikea CEO Jesper Brodin told BI. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / NOVEMBER 24 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies.

Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / NOVEMBER 24 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing.

Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings.

Title: Goldman Sachs says these 11 stocks are next in line to benefit from the AI wave as Magnificent 7 dominance starts to fade
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/next-ai-stocks-to-buy-magnificent-7-growth-slows-goldman-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-24T10:07:02Z
Full Content:
This year, the AI story has dominated the stock market. Just seven stocks have fueled much of the market's rally: Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla. The Magnificent Seven have returned 148% since the end of 2022, drastically outperforming the 55% return for the rest of the S&P 500 index over that time. These tech behemoths have seen their earnings turbocharged by their market dominance in sectors such as cloud computing, software, and semiconductors. AI infrastructure stocks have also started to take off. Data-center stocks like Vertiv and Digital Realty have soared as the demand to build out AI capacity has risen. But now, so-called "Phase 3" AI stocks, which are rolling out the technology to increase their revenues, are set to shine, according to Goldman Sachs. 2025 will be the year of transition from investing in AI infrastructure to AI beneficiaries, Goldman's Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin said. Two years after the debut of ChatGPT, more and more revenue-generating use cases for AI are emerging. "While Phase 2 stocks may continue to outperform the broad equity market, we expect returns will be earnings-driven and the risk/reward for new capital appears more attractive within Phase 3," Kostin and his team wrote in a recent note. After an incredible two-year rally, it's may be difficult to see the Magnificent Seven cooling off. The stocks have shown impressive earnings growth in the last year and have come to dominate the market, making up about 30% of the S&P 500 by market cap. However, the growth that placed them there isn't sustainable for the long term, Kostin said. That's not to say that the Magnificent Seven aren't solid companies. Goldman still expects them to outperform the rest of the index in 2025, but the bank is expecting them to do so by only 7%. For context, the Magnificent Seven outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 by 22% so far this year and 63% in 2023. Valuations for the market's biggest performers are overripe: the Magnificent Seven trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30x, while the rest of the index trades at a modest 19x. That's where the AI Phase 3 trade comes in. These companies, whose revenues and earnings are set to get a boost from AI implementation, are valued much more reasonably, with the typical Phase 3 company trading at only 0.1 standard deviations more expensive than average, compared to 0.5 for Phase 2. Valuations for Phase 3 stocks are depressed due to a recent decreased enthusiasm for AI, as some market experts have been questioning if AI is a trillion-dollar bubble ready to pop, according to Goldman Sachs. Lower expectations for Phase 3 stocks isn't necessarily a bad thing, though — it makes it easier for these companies to beat investor expectations and increase their share price. On the other hand, expectations for Nvidia have risen so high that the stock still fell in after-hours trading in the wake of consensus-beating Q3 revenue performance. "The share price performance of the companies in the infrastructure basket has dramatically outpaced their trajectory of earnings growth," Kostin said of Phase 2 companies. On the other hand, companies in the AI-enabled revenue group have seen share price growth in line with earnings growth. "And so our analysis is there's potential for multiple expansion in those stocks," Kostin added. To find companies likely to see enhanced revenues from AI, Goldman Sachs analyzed recent messaging from company management regarding AI rollout. The bank identified the following 11 companies adopting AI to enhance their revenues as well as recent commentary from Q3 earnings calls indicating increased AI usage. Ticker: ACVA Earnings commentary: "Our appraisal solutions incorporate AI imaging for damage detection and real-time localized pricing that is condition-enhanced, based on millions of inspections in our data mode. It's still early days in this category, but we believe self-inspection can unlock a number of long-term growth opportunities, including TAM expansion." Ticker: CVLT Earnings commentary: "And with our recent Clumio acquisition, we're bringing innovative recovery capabilities to Amazon S3. This depth is paramount as many organizations rely on S3 to store large data and growing AI datasets." Ticker: NET Earnings commentary: "A rapidly growing AI company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one-year, $7 million pool of funds contract for Workers AI. This company signed a $500,000 contract in Q2 for Cloudflare to be their 'platform for AI for inference, storage, image optimization and application security.' They quickly recognized the value of our platform and are now moving all of their workloads over to make Cloudflare their single inference cloud platform. With Workers AI, this customer is able to improve cost efficiency with our pay per inference model and also eliminate the need for a dedicated team to run and manage their infrastructure." Ticker: DDOG Earnings Commentary: "At the end of Q3, about 3,000 customers used one or more Datadog AI integrations to send us data about their AI, machine learning, and LLM usage. As some of these experiments start turning into production AI applications, we are seeing initial signs of traction for our LLM Observability product. Now, some of our growth is coming from AI-native customers, who this quarter represented more than 6% of our Q3 ARR, up from more than 4% in Q2 and about 2.5% of our ARR in the year-ago quarter." Ticker: DOCN Earnings commentary: "Revenue growth remained steady in the third quarter at 12% year over year, with solid performance in Core Cloud and continued growth in AI despite lapping difficult comps from our managed hosting price increase in April 2023 and from the Paperspace acquisition in July 2023. We continue to see momentum in demand for our AI/ML products, where Q3 ARR again grew close to 200% year-over-year." Ticker: DT Earnings commentary: "We closed a seven-figure expansion with a leading finance management platform. This customer had limited visibility into the thousands of incidents occurring in their production environment. They estimated that these incidents were costing them hundreds of thousands of dollars. By extending Dynatrace's AI-driven platform into their production environment, they gained substantive visibility and resultant business value." Ticker: FTNT Earnings commentary: "AI Security Operation was a fast-growing pillar, outpacing the overall market with 32% billings growth, accounting for 10.5% of our total business, up 2 points." Ticker: IT Earnings commentary: "We see great demand from our clients on the issues you'd expect, so like cybersecurity, how do they use artificial intelligence, data and analytics." Ticker: HUBS Earnings commentary: "Our strategy is to embed AI into every hub and across the entire platform and democratize AI for scaling companies. Since the launch, we have seen a notable increase in AI awareness, adoption and usage. AI app awareness within HubSpot grew by 13% quarter-over-quarter with two-thirds of Enterprise and half of Pro customers engaging with AI features. Copilot, our AI assistant, has resonated well, particularly with Starter customers who use it to summarize CRM data and objects, rewrite text and generate insights from their customer data. Copilot is now in public beta, and we are seeing repeat usage with 43% of users, which is a strong start." Ticker: MA Earnings commentary: "We've now boosted the product with GenAI and the outcome that we see is tremendous. This is up to a 20% lift that we see. Now these are solutions that our customers opt in to because they like those solutions, and they like the lift that they get out of that." Ticker: NOW Earnings commentary: "ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With Now Assist, we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV, including six over $5 million, and two over $10 million, and this continues to be our fastest-growing product ever, and an accelerant to our cross-enterprise expansion."

The busiest shopping week of the year has arrived, bringing with it a frenzy of questions: What to buy? Where to buy? And how much to buy? Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday mark the start of the holiday shopping season, drawing millions of consumers to stores and online platforms in search of the best deals. And, of course, there’s excitement for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade later this month. More than just a shopping extravaganza, this period serves as a critical barometer of the nation’s economic health. Retail sales during these days offer valuable insights into consumer confidence, spending habits, and the overall financial pulse of the country. This year, holiday sales are projected to reach nearly $1 trillion, a 3.5% increase over the last year, according to the National Retail Federation. To help you navigate the excitement, here’s a curated list of retailers offering deals this holiday season, whether you’re shopping for tech, fashion, or home essentials. Walmart (WMT+2.04%) shoppers have a chance to score deals on both practical items and more extravagant gifts. While Black Friday discounts are available to all customers, Walmart’s loyalty members get exclusive perks, including early access to online deals. Additionally, Walmart is introducing “deal drops” and an AI shopping assistant to assist customers. On Amazon (AMZN+3.19%), Black Friday deals are available to all customers. Prime members often get extra perks, like early access to select deals – sometimes up to 30 minutes ahead of the general public. Target (TGT-3.03%) announced price cuts on 2,000 items in October, adding to the 5,000 products it marked down in May. Target shoppers have the opportunity to snag deals on everyday essentials and higher-end items. While Black Friday discounts will be available to all shoppers, Target’s loyalty members receive additional benefits, including early access to online deals and unlimited same-day delivery. If you want to buy fancy bags from Coach, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and others, check the list here for what they have to offer. This week, investors will see a lighter schedule for earnings reports, with no announcements expected on Thursday or Friday due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The stock market will be closed on Thursday, Thanksgiving day. However, the first half of the week remains eventful. On Monday, Bath & Body Works (BBWI-1.57%) is set to release its earnings results before the market closes. Tuesday will feature a flurry of activity from major retailers. Macy’s (M-0.22%), Burlington Stores (BURL-1.53%), Best Buy (BBY-4.92%), and Kohl’s (KKS) will announce their earnings before the market opens, providing insights into consumer spending trends as the holiday shopping season kicks off. Later in the day, tech giants Dell Technologies (DELL-1.62%) and HP (HPQ-0.50%) will report their earnings after the market closes. Also on Tuesday, cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike (CRWD+0.26%) will release its quarterly results post-market. This update will be closely watched, especially after the company faced a global outage earlier this year, raising questions about its resilience and operational performance. With key sectors including retail, technology, and cybersecurity in focus, these earnings could offer valuable indicators for broader market trends ahead of the holiday break. This week’s shortened schedule due to the Thanksgiving holiday means a lighter-than-usual release of macroeconomic data. However, several significant reports are still on the docket, providing valuable insights into the economy. On Tuesday, the Consumer Confidence Index for November will be released, offering a glimpse into consumer sentiment amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Additionally, new home sales data for October will be published, shedding light on activity in the housing market. In the afternoon, the FOMC minutes meeting will be made available, potentially offering clues about the central bank’s monetary policy outlook and inflation strategy. The economic focus continues on Wednesday, starting with the release of initial jobless claims, a weekly barometer of labor market health. Also on Wednesday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, a key measure of inflation tracking changes in consumer spending on goods and services, will be published. This data is closely watched by the Federal Reserve in shaping interest rate decisions. Additionally, the GDP’s first revision for Q3 will be released, providing an updated view of the economy’s performance during the third quarter. — Francisco Velasquez and Madeline Fitzgerald contributed to this article.

Title: Commentary: Stealth firing or ethical dismissal? Why employers terminate staff for minor offences
URL: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/stealth-firing-retrenchment-layoff-worker-employee-conduct-offence-4764586
Time Published: 2024-11-23T22:00:00Z

Commentary Enforcing a hard line on employee conduct could prevent bigger lapses but may prompt claims of disguised cost savings, says Anjli Raval for the Financial Times. As companies try to rein in costs and restrict workplace initiatives that do not help profits, workers are wary of falling victim to a fresh horror: The stealth sacking. (Photo: iStock) LONDON: Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy recently told employees that a new plan requiring them to be in the office five days a week did not amount to a “backdoor layoff”. Yet his reported comments at a company-wide meeting last week did not rebut a previous suggestion from a senior manager that staff who fail to comply could look for work elsewhere. As companies try to rein in costs and restrict workplace initiatives that do not help profits, workers are wary of falling victim to a fresh horror: The stealth sacking. Alongside a string of recent publicly announced mass layoffs – by companies including Nissan, Boeing and Citigroup – there have been a series of employers quietly justifying smaller-scale dismissals because of seemingly minor violations of company policy. Here the focus is not on the size and scope of redundancy programmes, how humanely managers handled them or whether support or severance pay was offered to affected staff, but on the specific rationale behind the decisions. Facebook owner Meta, for example, sacked about two dozen staff for abusing meal credit vouchers, while EY terminated the employment of a group of workers for watching multiple training videos at once, the Financial Times has reported. Infractions that workers have probably interpreted as minor misdemeanours in the past can now be sackable offences, and may prompt questions about whether cost savings are being disguised. “As with most stories, there are two sides,” says Leo Martin, managing director of GoodCorporation, a business ethics consultancy that helps organisations design, build and improve their ethics and compliance programmes. “From the employee perspective they may have been given unrealistic deadlines, excessive work pressures or have received unclear guidance as to what is expected, while the employer will feel that abusing a perk or taking short-cuts undermines their systems, [and that] cheating in an exam or lying about training … is a fundamental breach of trust.” Part of the motivation to take a tough line on employees could be to make an example of anyone deemed to be a rule-breaker. This level of corporate discipline has been more common among heavily regulated industries, such as banking and financial services, that have huge compliance functions and the risk of hefty penalties for any conduct breaches. Amanda Rajkumar, who has held senior human-resources (HR) leadership roles at JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas, says: “Banks and financial services have always come down hard … given the robust regulatory environment and strong requirement to demonstrate exemplary, ethical behaviour related to the fiduciary nature of the industry.” Another incentive for a tough stance is that small infractions, such as taking advantage of company perks or bending minor rules, can foreshadow more serious ethical lapses. This has fuelled a “zero-tolerance” approach to policy enforcement in some sectors, as companies seek to preserve what they see as a culture of integrity. One example from the financial crisis was when Fidelity Investments fired employees for being part of a fantasy football league that went against the company’s gambling rule. Early this year, several employees at US retailer Target were sacked after they used their status as staff to buy highly coveted Stanley cups ahead of customers. “The spotlight should be on the employees’ reason or motivation for breaking the rules,” adds Rajkumar. “A deliberate misuse of company resources usually indicates low engagement or a specific gripe against the firm.” A recent trend of staff turning to online platforms to vent their frustrations about perceived mistreatment by employers or indiscriminate layoffs has also pushed some companies to recalibrate their approach. Websites such as LinkedIn and anonymous review site, Glassdoor, give workers an outlet for grievances about their bosses, which can then spread quickly and damage the reputation of employers. In one example that went viral this year, Brittany Pietsch, an employee at internet company Cloudflare, recorded her nine-minute virtual meeting with HR representatives in which she was fired, and posted it to TikTok, spawning a new “Quit-Tok” trend. In the video, Pietsch confronted her seniors about the reasons for her termination, but they had “no specific” answers or “clarity”. Aware that employee complaints about terminations are no longer confined to private HR files, some companies are aiming to reduce backlash and curb reputational risk by emphasising policy-driven grounds for firing. Recruiters, HR heads and workplace experts say whether an employer has made a clear case for dismissal is becoming as important as the manner in which a termination is conducted. “Companies have had to be more mindful when they are firing staff because people are more vocal. We are in an era where snap decisions can have big blowbacks,” says Habiba Khatoon, a director at headhunter Robert Walters. She adds that in her experience managers are so wary of dismissing workers out of turn that they are delaying action until a record has been built of repeated performance issues or behaviour that violates company policy. Khatoon says more companies are talking about so-called “ethical firing”. This refers to a transparent, rule-based approach to dismissals, where managers can point to concrete breaches in policy rather than subjective issues, such as workers being a “poor fit”. Targeting terminations in this way has some advantages for employers. Basing decisions on documented infractions can help reduce staff numbers – and cut costs – without the optics of a struggling business that come with mass layoffs. And unlike big rounds of job cuts, which often require severance packages, firings for conduct issues are typically exempt from such obligations. Lucas Shaw, an expert in hiring and retention strategies, says he has been part of a conversation in which senior staff at a company – not one of his clients – instructed their IT team to look for misconduct on an individual’s record to avoid paying a costly redundancy settlement. “It’s incredibly underhand.” Employment experts say such practices underscore the need for staff to closely read and understand company policies and codes of conduct, which are at times being followed more rigidly than in the past. The advice for employers is to provide stronger and simpler guidelines about what is acceptable and what is not. Rules and disciplinary processes must be unambiguous and fairly applied no matter how senior an employee is. “Companies need to ensure they carry out fair and thorough investigations regarding any allegation of misconduct,” says GoodCorporation’s Martin. “Not only does this ensure a proper process is followed, it can also protect an organisation from accusations that what they are doing may have an ulterior motive.” In an era when workers prioritise transparency, selective enforcement of codes of conduct can erode trust as employees might see it as an excuse to target some staff. This, in the long run, may “be more damaging to the company than the actual employee misconduct”, warns Martin.

Title: Here’s Why Super Investors are Loading Up on Brookfield Stock (NYSE:BN)

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. While it hasn’t gotten the attention of tech stocks or AI stocks, shares of alternative asset manager Brookfield Corporation (BN) have been red hot this year, surging 66.5% over the past 12 months. What’s more, 13F filings show that super investors like Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman and Third Point’s Daniel Loeb loaded up on the stock during the third quarter. Unlock your investing potential with TipRanks Premium - Now At 40% OFF! Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter I’m bullish on Brookfield based on its sterling long-term track record of delivering market-beating returns, compelling long-term vision for the future, the large positions that top investors like Ackman and Loeb are taking in the stock, and its perfect 10 rating from TipRanks’ Smart Score system. Let’s take a closer look at this $85 billion company. Brookfield Corporation describes itself as a “leading global investment firm focused on building long-term wealth for institutions and individuals.” The Toronto, Canada-based firm is an alternative asset manager that operates businesses in a wide array of industries, including asset management, real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy, private equity, and more. During the third quarter, renowned investors like Bill Ackman and Daniel Loeb accumulated significant positions in Brookfield. Loeb’s Third Point Capital, which has nearly $7.5 billion in assets under management, initiated a new position in the company, buying 4,725,000 shares for an average price of $53.15 per share, according to the firm’s 13F filing. Brookfield is Third Point’s eleventh-largest holding as of the filing. At the same time, Bill Ackman’s firm Pershing Square, which was already an investor in Brookfield after initiating a position during the second quarter, increased its stake in the company by nearly 380%. Pershing Square now owns 32,735,883 shares of Brookfield and is the fund’s largest holding, accounting for 13.5% of assets, indicating that Ackman has significant conviction in the pick and sees it as one of the best investment opportunities in the current market. Brookfield has proven itself to be a long-term winner. Over the past decade, the company has delivered a phenomenal total return of 800%. This massive total return easily outpaces that of the broader market — the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) returned 187.3% over the same time horizon. And Brookfield’s track record of generating exceptional returns goes back even further then that — the company has delivered a phenomenal total annualized return of 18% over the past 30 years. While Brookfield has an excellent long-term track record, it isn’t resting on its laurels — it says that its best days are still ahead of it and that it is now better-positioned than ever before to deliver annualized returns of 15% or more going forward. Brookfield’s management says it will achieve this by investing in good businesses, running these businesses well, wisely allocating free cash flow, aligning everyone with its long-term goals, and adapting to the changing world around them. Examples of the company adapting to the changing world include its extensive investments in the energy transition and its involvement in data centers. Brookfield management says it expects to grow free cash flow by 20% per share on an annual basis over the next five years. This means it will generate a total of $47 billion in free cash flow over this time frame, or $30 per share that it can “allocate wisely,” which is an attractive total given that shares currently trade for $57.67. Brookfield says this will help it to deliver annualized returns on invested capital of 16% over the next five years. While shares currently trade for $57.67, Brookfield believes they are worth an intrinsic value of $84 per share today and that this 16% CAGR on invested capital will bring it to a valuation of $176 per share by 2029, meaning that the share price could be more than triple over the next five years. Obviously, a lot can happen between now and 2029, and even the best plans can face unexpected challenges. There’s also certainly no guarantee the market will agree with Brookfield about the intrinsic value of its shares at that point in time. That said, even if Brookfield doesn’t reach this exact number, there is plenty of room for considerable upside between the current share price and Brookfield’s target, making this a tempting value proposition for investors. Brookfield also believes that it is well-positioned to grow earnings per share at a 20% clip over the next five years to $9.77 per share (up from $3.67 for 2024). If the company can achieve this, it is trading for a song at today’s prices. While these are lofty targets, Brookfield’s excellent track record over multiple decades lends credibility to the idea that the company can achieve many of these goals. While Brookfield has a fairly low dividend yield of 0.6%, it’s worth noting that it has still returned an impressive $20 billion worth of capital to its shareholders over the last five years through both dividends and share buybacks. With cash flow expected to increase in the years to come, as discussed above, I would expect the company to continue to reward its shareholders with considerable capital returns. Turning to Wall Street, BN earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average BN stock price target of $60 implies 2.4% upside potential from current levels. See more BN analyst ratings Adding to Brookfield’s appeal, it also achieves a Perfect 10 rating from TipRanks’ Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating, so Brookfield’s perfect rating is particularly impressive. Shares of Brookfield have posted strong gains over the past year, and the stock is catching the eye of renowned investors like Third Point’s Daniel Loeb and Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman. But you don’t have to be a hedge fund manager to gain exposure to this compelling investment opportunity; everyday investors can add Brookfield to their own portfolios. If management can execute on achieving this five-year vision, this would represent phenomenal returns for all of the stock’s investors. I’m bullish on Brookfield based on the confidence of these prestigious investors, its track record as a long-term winner, and its compelling roadmap for delivering substantial returns over the next five years.

Title: ChatGPT updates, warehouse robots, and special agents: This week's AI launches

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. OpenAI announced this week that it’s starting to roll out Advanced Voice Mode on the web browser version of ChatGPT. Paid users of ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu will be able to start a real-time conversation on the ChatGPT website. The AI startup also announced that it updated its GPT-4o model’s creative writing ability to have “more natural, engaging, and tailored writing.” The updated model can also work better with uploaded files, OpenAI said. The Allen Institute for AI announced its Tülu 3 family of open, fine-tuned models this week. The fine-tuning, or post-training, process refines models to perform specific tasks. Through Tülu 3, developers and researchers can find open-source data sets, model training recipes, code, and evaluation frameworks. The models range from 8 billion to 70 billion parameters, or the variables a model learns from training data that guide its ability to make predictions, according to Ai2. Enveda, a biotech company that uses AI to turn natural compounds into new medicines, announced an oversubscribed $130 million Series C funding round this week. The round was led by Kinnevik and FPV, and brings Enveda’s total funding to $360 million. The funding will help the company with advancing its pipeline of ten development drug candidates. Enveda is building an AI-powered platform called a “sequencer” “that combines metabolomics data with machine learning and high-throughput biological experiments to answer two fundamental questions of any natural sample at scale: (1) What are the molecules?, and (2) What do they do?,” the company said. “Some of the world’s greatest pharmaceutical breakthroughs have been derived from just 0.1% of nature’s chemistry,” Viswa Colluru, chief executive of Enveda, said in a statement. “We developed our platform to rapidly expand access to nature’s chemistry to find therapeutics at roughly four times the speed–and it’s already delivering results in the form of a deep and differentiated pipeline. This funding will help us advance multiple candidates to exciting clinical catalysts in the next year, confirming our guiding vision that life’s chemistry is an excellent source for new medicines.” Pickle Robot, which develops robotic automation systems for unloading trucks, announced a $50 million Series B funding round this week. The company, which calls itself a pioneer of physical AI, also announced that six customers have ordered over 30 production robots in the third quarter for deployment in early 2025. Pickle Robot’s physical AI technology combines a vision system with generative AI foundation models trained on millions of real logistics and warehouse operations data. “Pickle Robot customers are experiencing the value of Physical AI applied to a common logistics process that challenges thousands of operations every day,” AJ Meyer, chief executive and founder of Pickle Robot, said in a statement. “The new funding and our strategic customer relationships enable Pickle to chart the future of supply chain robotics, rapidly expand our core product capabilities, and grow our business to deliver tremendous customer value now and in the future.” Lightning AI, the company behind the PyTorch Lightning deep learning framework, announced a $50 million equity investment this week that included Nvidia (NVDA) and J.P. Morgan (JPM). PyTorch Lightning has received over 160 million downloads since Lightning AI launched a year ago. Lightning AI combines dozens of separate AI development tools on one, multi-cloud platform where developers can build, train, and deploy AI models, and host AI apps securely. “Building your own AI platform today is like building your own Slack — it’s complex, costly, and not core to your business,” William Falcon, founder and chief executive of Lightning AI, said in a statement. “The value for enterprises lies in their data, domain knowledge, and unique models — not in maintaining AI infrastructure. We have thousands of developers single-handedly training and deploying models at a scale that would have required teams of developers without Lightning.” Thoughtful AI launched its specialized AI agents for revenue cycle management in healthcare this week. The AI-powered revenue cycle transformation company’s new agents include CODY for coding and notes review, and CAM for claims processing. “Our team of AI Agents turn RCM from a bottleneck into a powerhouse, using AI and automation to tackle tedious, time-consuming tasks so that healthcare teams can optimize revenue and focus on what matters most – patients,” Alex Zekoff, co-founder and chief executive of Thoughtful AI, said in a statement. Reforged Labs, an AI-powered video creation service for mobile game studios, launched its AI-powered video ad service this week that it says can deliver tailored, cost-effective ads in less than 24 hours. The startup’s proprietary AI engine was trained with thousands of game ads, Reforged Labs said. “We want to help level the playing field for game studios with limited resources,” Robert Huynh, chief executive and co-founder of Reforged Labs, said in a statement. “With our full-service creative solution that’s tailored for game marketing, studios can benefit from proven ad templates and AI-driven production and editing, all without lengthy briefs or big budgets.”

Title: 3 underrated Netflix movies you should watch this weekend (November 22-24)
URL: https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/netflix-underrated-movies-watch-november-22-24-2024/
Time Published: 2024-11-22T21:30:29Z
Full Content:
Are you ready to get Glicked this weekend? No, I didn’t call you a dirty name, that’s the actual moniker being used for the simultaneous release of Wicked and Gladiator II. I’m not going to see either this weekend as both are expected to make tons of cash and draw in a lot of crowds in theaters over the next few days. I’m content to stay in this weekend and queue up a good movie (or three) on Netflix. Feel the same way? Well, here’s a handy list of a few underrated movies that are worth your time. You can always watch Glicked later in the year … or never, if that’s more your vibe. We also have guides to the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, the best movies on Max, and the best movies on Disney+. Sometimes, you just need to see two bona fide movie stars show off their charisma for two hours even if the movie they are in is only so-so. That’s the case with Spy Game, a 2001 action thriller from Top Gun director Tony Scott. The stars in question are Robert Redford, then entering his senior citizen heartthrob phase, and Brad Pitt, who was still in his prime, golden locks and all. It’s a pity the movie itself wasn’t any better. Redford stars as Nathan Muir, a grizzled CIA officer who is pulled into one final case involving his former protégé, Tom Bishop (Pitt). It seems Bishop has run afoul with China’s government and is set to be executed in 24 hours. Muir is the only one who can save him, but as he reflects on their complicated past and their shady spy missions in locales such as West Germany, he wonders if this isn’t the fate Bishop deserves. Spy Game is streaming on Netflix. In Good Company is just good enough, and what’s wrong with that? The 2004 comedy, which is just about to celebrate its 20th(!) anniversary, is the very definition of vanilla, with squeaky clean stars like Topher Grace, Scarlett Johansson, and Dennis Quaid all bringing varying degrees of beige to their respective roles. Yet the movie works, and Quaid in particular stands out as a star who knows how to turn on the charm to win over an audience. Dan Foreman (Quaid) is a longtime ad executive who is good at his job. That doesn’t prevent his company from undergoing severe layoffs and demoting him so he now reports to Carter Duryea (Grace), a 26-year-old business prodigy who is separating from his cheating wife. That’s awkward enough, but when Dan invites Carter over to dinner one night and his young boss begins to fall in love with his even younger daughter Alex (Johansson), things go from awkward to just plain weird fast. The movie plays this scenario largely for laughs, and it is funny to see Quaid work through the sheer absurdity of watching his twentysomething boss awkwardly try to romance his college-bound daughter. Is it also icky? Yeah, a bit, but Quaid and the rest of the cast sells it and the movie doesn’t take itself too seriously. In Good Company is streaming on Netflix. Animation is currently in a golden age of creativity. The Spider-Verse films, The Boy and the Heron, and this year’s The Wild Robot are some of the best ever made in the genre, and that’s just the non-Disney ones! One of the very best in the last decade is Kubo and the Two Strings, a stunning stop-motion animated film from the good folks over at Laika Studios, who gave the world the modern goth girl classic Coraline. This one is just as good, and features the vocal talents of Charlize Theron, Ralph Fiennes, Matthew McConaughey, Rooney Mara, George Takei, and Art Parkinson as the 12-year-old title protagonist. In feudal Japan, the one-eyed Kubo is sent by his mother to a faraway land to flee his evil aunties and find his missing father’s armor. There, he teams up with Monkey, a snow monkey charm come to life, Little Hanzo, an origami figure resembling Kubo’s long-absent dad, and Beetle, a former samurai who cannot remember his past, to travel through strange lands and battle mystical creatures in an attempt to find the armor and avoid capture (or worse) from Kubo’s wicked extended family. As typical with movies like this, what Kubo finds instead is the value of friendship and the necessity of letting go of loved ones. The film features superb animation and a stirring score by Dario Marianelli, both of which create a colorful fantasy world that would impress even the most jaded cinephile. It’s a great kids film, yes, but it’s also a great film period, and all adults should watch Kubo and the Two Strings and ignite their imaginations once again. Kubo and the Two Strings is streaming on Netflix. It's hard to believe December is just around the corner. It seems like it was only yesterday that I was watching Twisters in the movie theater and enjoying the warm summer weather. Now, I have to stress out about traveling for the holidays and shopping for loved ones. As an escape, I tend to turn to Netflix to find my next latest binge-worthy series. And the streamer's December lineup looks like it won't disappoint. From a British spy show to a black comedy about a desirable L.A. home, Netflix might be saving its best shows for last in 2024. Hulu is never going to have all of the flashy original movies that Netflix has, but it's going to have its share of box office hits now and then. This week, one of last summer's sleeper hits, Alien: Romulus, is making its streaming debut on Hulu. And that film more than earned its place on our weekly list of the three great Hulu movies that you need to stream this weekend. Our other picks include a period drama that has a great cast, as well a sports comedy from an actress-turned-talk show host. Welcome to the week of Ridley Scott. The 86-year-old filmmaker's next movie is Gladiator II, the 29th feature film in his illustrious five-decade career. The sequel to the Oscar-winning Gladiator, Gladiator II stars Paul Mescal as Lucius, the former heir to the throne and son of Maximus (Russell Crowe) and Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). After Roman forces kill his wife and force him into slavery, Lucius trains to be a gladiator and sets his sights on exacting his vengeance against the Empire. Gladiator II will definitely be an awesome theatrical experience. After seeing Gladiator II, why not revisit more projects in Scott's filmography? FAST services are hosting several of Scott's movies, including Gladiator, for free. Our suggestions include a traumatic war film, a groundbreaking road trip adventure, and an espionage thriller.

Samsung's second-tier OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of WIRED reviewer Ryan Waniata’s favorite TVs of the year. This QD-OLED panel boasts fabulously rich colors, can get slightly brighter than the LG C4, and has the perfect black levels and excellent picture quality from any angle that make OLED the dominant TV tech today. This TV has HDMI 2.1 support across all four inputs, and Samsung's Game Hub lets you stream from loads of services, including Xbox. The only obvious downside is the lack of Dolby Vision. You can find more options in our Best Early Black Friday TV Deals. Perhaps the best 4K streamer for folks who watch loads of Amazon Prime shows and movies, this Fire Stick is very easy to set up and use, supports Wi-Fi 6E for fast and stable streaming, and packs 16 gigabytes of storage. Alexa is built into the remote to help you find content or ask questions about what you’re watching. The picture-in-picture mode is handy for showing security cameras or controlling other smart home devices. There's also “Ambient Experience,” which cycles through art or nature scenes on your TV when you’re not watching something. The latest Apple Watch Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best Apple Watch you can buy. It is an excellent fitness and health tracker, brings phone notifications and calls to your wrist, and works wonderfully well in concert with your iPhone. Sadly, it lacks blood oxygen sensing, and you'll still need to charge it every night. We don't see many deals on Apple's latest wares, so this is a discount worth grabbing if you're set on an Apple Watch. The Apple MacBook Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Apple laptop. WIRED reviewer Brenda Stolyar says it offers great performance for everyday tasks, has a bright display, and provides solid battery life. This lightweight device is the MacBook pick in our Best Laptops guide. The 15-inch model is also on sale at $1,044 ($255 off) and has a bigger display, better battery life, and more speakers, but is otherwise identical. These are the best trackers for folks with an iPhone, and you can use them to keep tabs on your keys, travel luggage, bike, or whatever else you worry might go missing. The location of each AirTag is marked clearly in the Find My app. The battery should last you a year, and we have a guide on how to replace your AirTag battery. Just please don’t use them to track people. This excellent 3-in-1 charger for your iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch is one of the best MagSafe chargers around. You can fold it away to a very compact size, making it an ideal travel companion. Charging for your iPhone goes up to 15 watts via a magnetic pad that can adjust to your preferred angle. There’s another pad for AirPods or other wireless earbuds, and a fold-out Apple Watch charger on the back. A 5-foot USB-C cable and wall adapter are included. This is one of our favorite wireless chargers, but it is expensive, so this sale might be the perfect time to grab one. We recommend springing for the Qi2 version, as it will be compatible with the wave of Qi2 Android phones coming in 2025, but it also works with MagSafe iPhones (iPhone 13 models and newer support the Qi2 protocol). If you're just an iPhone person, the standard MagSafe version of this charger is also on sale for $77 ($33 off). Check out our Nomad Black Friday sale post for more deals. Tacto is an app with physical pieces that convert your iPad, Android, or Fire tablet into a game board. With Tacto Chess, your kids can learn the basics, from how the pieces move to strategies for victory. The animated app features friendly voice acting and stories, chess puzzles to solve, a move predictor, and your child can play against AI or another person. My kids had some fun with this when they were learning, and it helped them understand chess a little better. This appears in our best STEM toys for kids guide. My quest to find the best portable chargers has led me to test hundreds of power banks, but this is my current favorite. I love the look of this transparent, prism-shaped device, but it’s also extremely useful with a maximum output of 170 watts and a 24,000-mAh capacity, not to mention tough, with an IP66 rating for water resistance. It will fast-charge just about any small gadget, from phones to laptops, and the handy wee display shows battery life as a percentage, time remaining, and the input or output in watts. I have once seen it slightly cheaper, but this is a good price. As a fan of the translucent electronics craze in the 1990s, I was immediately smitten to this power bank. You can see the ports, chips, and rechargeable Samsung Li-ion batteries inside. While an even better Shargeek (now Sharge) device replaced this in our best portable chargers guide, this power bank is still great. A color display shows the voltage, current, and power flowing in or out, and you can dig deeper for more stats. The DC barrel port lets you specify voltage and current for different devices, up to 75 watts, the first USB-C supports PD PPS up to 100 watts, the second offers 30 watts and supports PD 3.0 and Quick Charge 4 standards, and the USB-A port is QC 3.0 at up to 18 watts. The Qi2 wireless charging standard was developed in partnership with Apple and features MagSafe-like magnetic alignment and speedier iPhone charging rates of up to 15 watts. This power bank can also charge other Qi2 devices (when they appear) and existing Qi devices (just more slowly). This compact power bank also has a handy kickstand, a two-way USB-C port, and an LED display that shows power and time to charge. You can attach MagSafe iPhones in portrait or landscape orientation, and it works with Apple’s StandBy mode, making it one of the best MagSafe power banks. The Anker 737 is the upgrade pick in our best portable chargers guide. With a whopping 24,000 mAh capacity, support for power delivery 3.1, and the ability to send or receive up to 140 watts, this is the only power bank you need. It weighs nearly 1.4 pounds but is fairly compact, considering how much power it holds. A smart digital display shows battery percentage, and you can tap the power button to cycle through stats, including the temperature, total output, and more. This versatile portable charger fast-charged everything I tested and can easily juice up three devices at once. The first portable power station from DJI can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and has DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can charge phones, power microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it’s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones, because it can fast-charge most models. It gets a little noisy with a lot of gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our Best Portable Power Stations guide. Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. The Mill food recycler just might be one of the most idiot-proof ways out there to dispatch food waste for those who don’t have access to municipal compost. Throw in food scraps (even meat!) and the Mill grinds and dries them into odorless, shelf-stable bits overnight. There is a subscription program where you can send the grounds off in the mail to be made into chicken feed, and you can also use your grounds in the garden. We didn’t have the greatest success with that when we reviewed it earlier this year (6/10 WIRED Review), but we did find it to be a great device overall. This is Mill’s first-ever Black Friday sale, so if you were on the fence, this is the time to give it a shot. (Mill also offers a 90-day trial with free returns if you change your mind.) —Kat Merck As seen in our guide to the Best White Elephant Gifts, this funny little tumbler holds both cereal and milk separately to be enjoyed on the go without the cereal becoming soggy. There is a learning curve—small, spherical cereal bits like Cheerios work best; you must block part of the milk hole with your lower lip lest the milk flow outpace the cereal flow; and the whole contraption tends to leak if the lid isn’t twisted on at exactly the right angle. However, it’s available in seven different colors and makes a great gag gift or stocking stuffer for someone who either loves cereal or never has time to eat breakfast. —Kat Merck The best smart shades can be awfully expensive, but this clever retrofit gadget from Eve can make one of your existing roller blinds smart. Simply check compatibility by measuring the circumference of the tube inside your roller shade. This kit works with Matter, so you can use it with your platform of choice, but you do need a home hub (with Apple HomeKit, for example, that is a HomePod mini, HomePod, or Apple TV) if you want to schedule it to open and close automatically or use voice commands. Mine works perfectly, and I love the handy pull chain as a simple control backup, but it can be a little noisy. One of the cheapest and best Govee smart lights you can buy is this affordable light strip that comes in several lengths. It is designed to be hidden behind furniture, so you just see the reflected light. We are highlighting the longest 100-foot option here, but all are segmented to display multiple colors, can be controlled wirelessly from the app or using voice controls, and support Govee’s enormous variety of lighting effects. These light strips also appear in our best smart lighting guide. This is one of the best sales we’ve seen on this boxy air purifier, which I’ve had in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove. I love that the slim profile and rectangular shape make this purifier easy to tuck away somewhere unobtrusive (though it still does need to be located 8 inches away from a wall), and that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapiro This cylindrical air purifier covers 2,745 square feet (at an air exchange rate of two times per hour, less than the recommended four, so we’d recommend a room half that size) with a 4-in-1 filter consisting of pre-filter, HEPA, activated carbon, and an antibacterial layer. Bosch came out with the Air line of Energy Star- and CARB-certified air purifiers this summer, including small, medium, and large versions. Look for this large version in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers. I’ve been using it on the 1,300-square-foot main floor of my house that has 23-foot ceilings, and the difference in smells, dust, and overall air quality has been extremely noticeable. It’s got a ring-light indicator (red = bad, blue = good) as well as a digital display that shows PM 2.5, total volatile organic compounds, temperature, and humidity. It’s also imperceptibly quiet with the fan running on the lowest speed. The only downside is the expensive filters that must be replaced every six to nine months. —Kat Merck For folks with smaller homes, the Dyson V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum. It is very lightweight, easy to maneuver, and will pack away in a small space. It is also effective at keeping your place pristine, with a wide assortment of attachments to help you get into nooks and crannies. It even has a neon-green laser to shine a spotlight on every speck of dust you may have missed. As one of the best sleep trackers, the Withings Sleep Analyzer tracks your movements, breathing, and heart rate throughout the night, sending data to the Withings Health Mate app. Each morning you can review your sleep phases, broken into awake, REM, light, and deep sleep, and get a sleep score out of 100 based on duration, depth, regularity, interruptions, time to fall asleep, and time to get up. This mat slips under your mattress, making it a great sleep-tracking option for folks who don’t like to wear watches or rings in bed. This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating, so it can be used outdoors. What makes this one of the best indoor security cameras you can buy is the face recognition. It can warn you when there’s a stranger in your home and tell you when your kids or partner get in. With HDR, the 1080p video quality is crystal clear at 30 fps, and there’s automatic night vision when it’s dark. You also get decent two-way audio and enforced two-factor authentication, which is important for an indoor camera. The big downside is that you need a Nest Aware subscription costing $8 per month ($80/year) for 30 days of event video history and familiar face alerts, but that covers all your Nest devices. There are so many good-quality, affordable security cameras on the market, and the Blink Mini 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorites. It can record 1080p footage at up to 30 fps, offers decent low-light performance, and boasts on-device person detection. The catch is the subscription at $3 per month or $30 per year for a single camera, but it nets you a generous 60-day unlimited cloud video history. This camera is ideal for sitting unobtrusively on a shelf and keeping an eye on your home when you are away. This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. Arlo ticks all the boxes with crisp 2K video, a wide 160-degree field of view, two-way audio, and a direct connection to Wi-Fi. That’s why the Arlo Pro 5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our best outdoor security cameras guide. The Arlo app is swift to load, offers excellent notifications, and supports two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face, phone permitting. The catch is a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) that’s required for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This versatile device is the pan-and-tilt pick in our best outdoor security camera guide. It’s ideal if you want a hands-off camera you can set up and leave to do its thing. The built-in solar panel keeps the battery topped off. The camera features a dual-lens system with a main lens that boasts a 135-degree field of view and records sharp video, paired with a telephoto lens that offers 3x zoom in the center of the frame (it goes up to 8x hybrid zoom). There’s also 8 GB of storage built-in to keep things local. The relatively low 15 fps frame rate is disappointing, and the two-way audio quality is not great, but there is onboard AI and subject tracking. A security camera kit is an easy way to get started with home security, and this Eufy one includes two cameras with a home hub. The upgrade pick for folks seeking a local, subscription-free system in our best outdoor security cameras guide, the EufyCam 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a lot going for it. Solar is built-in for battery top-ups, video resolution goes all the way up to 4K, and there's 16 GB of local storage (expandable up to 16 TB) on the connected HomeBase 3 hub. You also get on-device people, pet, and vehicle recognition, and this system can even recognize familiar faces, though it’s not as good at it as Google’s Nest cams. While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. Folks who receive loads of packages will appreciate Eufy’s dual camera doorbell because it provides a view of your porch floor and front step, alongside the usual picture of whoever is calling. This is the best subscription-free option in our best video doorbells guide because there’s 8 GB of built-in storage for local recording, and it can connect to a HomeBase 3 hub for more. The 2K footage is crisp and clear, and there’s on-device people, package, and even face detection, though it’s not always accurate, and this doorbell can be laggy when connecting away from home. With a pleasing range of adjustments, including seat depth, recline level, and armrest length, this dependable office chair is easy to assemble. It can serve you well, no matter what height you are, and even boasts adjustable lumbar support, which is essential for folks who sit for hours every day. This is the lowest price we have seen yet on the best office chair for most people. Use code BFCM for 15 percent off. You can find more bargains in the Branch Black Friday sale. Simple to set up and use, Amazon's Eero mesh systems are easy to recommend and can act as smart home hubs with support for Matter, Thread, and Zigbee. The tri-band Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) mesh adds the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. It’s a great choice for busy households with many devices and a 1-Gbps or faster connection. Performance is excellent, but the 6-GHz band is short-range. The Eero Plus subscription is expensive ($10 per month or $100 per year), but it includes comprehensive parental controls, advanced security, ad blocking, and even a password manager and VPN service. Folks with smaller homes and connections up to 500 Mbps should consider the Eero 6 (3-Pack) on sale at $150 ($50 off), but the more heavily discounted Eero 6+ (3-Pack) at $195 ($105 off) is a better deal if you can afford it. This TP-Link mesh will cover your whole home on a limited budget (it’s the budget pick in our best mesh routers guide). It is a Wi-Fi 6 dual-band mesh (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) that is easy to set up. It’s not the speediest mesh, but is fast enough for folks with internet connections of 500 Mbps or less. The vase-like design blends in easily on shelves or tables, and each router sports two gigabit Ethernet ports. For more than basic security and parental controls, you need Security+ at $5 a month or $36 a year, and Advanced Parental Controls at $3 a month or $18 a year). But, even with the subscriptions, the X20 is an affordable way to get reliable Wi-Fi. The Deco BE85 (7/10, WIRED Review) was TP-Link's first Wi-Fi 7 mesh. It delivers unrivaled performance, wide coverage, and is easy to set up and use. A two-pack will be enough for most folks, and each router has two 10-Gbps Ethernet ports, two 2.5-Gbps ports, and a USB 3.0 port. You need a very fast multi-gig internet connection and loads of Wi-Fi 7 devices to make this a worthwhile purchase, but it has dropped in price significantly since release. We recommended this Wi-Fi 6E system in our best mesh routers guide until it was replaced by the newer XE70 Pro, but this is still a good choice, especially with the discount. It is a tri-band (2.4-GHz, 5-GHz, and 6-GHz) mesh with impressive range and stability. Each of the three routers has three Gigabit ports. By default, the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul, but you can open it up for devices. If you have a connection of 1 Gbps or less, this mesh will serve you well. While enhanced security and parental controls require subscriptions, most folks can live without them. Topping our best routers guide, this affordable router combines a slick design with reliable performance. It’s only a dual-band (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) router, but should be fast enough for most folks and will cover an average-sized home with an internet connection of 1 Gbps or less. Ample connectivity includes four gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a single gigabit WAN port, and a USB 3.0 port on the back. The setup is simple, TP-Link’s Tether app is easy to use, and basic security and features like QoS (Quality of Service) are included. If you want the top-of-the-line mesh system from Amazon’s Eero, it’s the Max 7. This tri-band system supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard. Each router can cover up to 2,500 square feet, and they have four Ethernet ports apiece, two rated at 10 Gbps and two at 2.5 Gbps. You can mix and match Eero routers, the app is very accessible, and this system is designed to be hands-off. It also boasts comprehensive smart home connectivity, and the optional Eero Plus subscription is pricey ($10 per month or $100 per year) but bundles parental controls, enhanced security, ad blocking, a password manager, and VPN service. Eero has worked out some of the kinks since I tested the Max 7 (7/10, WIRED Review), but it’s still likely overkill for most folks and more than you need to spend unless you have a big busy household with a multi-gig internet connection. Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. Some of the best wire-free earbuds you can get for under $100, the Anker Soundcore Space A40 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) impressed WIRED reviewer Ryan Waniata with noise cancellation, detailed sound, multipoint pairing, and a wireless charging case at a very reasonable price. These earbuds are regularly discounted, but this is close to the lowest price we’ve seen. You can shrug off battery anxiety with the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless (10/10, WIRED Recommends), because this gaming headset can go for an amazing 300 hours between charges. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft said it delivers rich, booming sound, has comfortable ear cups, and boasts intuitive controls. All it really lacks is a headphone jack. Discounts are common on this headset, and it may have dipped slightly lower, but this is still a bargain worth grabbing. We think Amazon’s Audible Premium Plus is the best audiobook service, as it bundles a library of Audible Originals, audiobooks, and podcasts, with one credit per month to use on any audiobook title you fancy, and regular exclusive deals and discounts. Usually, you get one month free, after which it costs $15 per month, but any nonsubscriber can get three months for $1 until the end of the year. Remember that you get to keep titles purchased with credits, even after your subscription ends. Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap. Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano declared this uniquely shaped hair dryer as “made for curls” in our Best Hair Dryers guide. Basically a diffuser and dryer in one, it’s designed to dry curls gently while cutting down on frizz and puffiness. It doesn’t have a traditional handle, but that didn’t bother Medea. If you’re short on space in your bathroom and don’t want to have to store a hair dryer and separate diffuser attachment, this could be the solution for you. —Kat Merck As seen in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, WIRED reviewer Nena Farrell is a fan of this two-in-one tourmaline ceramic hair straightener and curler that ranges from 284 to 428 degrees Fahrenheit. The unique barrel has 88 little holes that blow cool air with the touch of a button, supposedly helping to set styles to last up to 48 hours. Nena did not find that her hair stayed curlier or straighter after using this feature, but this is still a decent deal on a unique tool for someone who may not want to have to store both a curling iron and a flat iron. —Kat Merck This OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-tos. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. I also like that it comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off for Black Friday, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. And on the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site, and while testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck There are hair straighteners that are best for thick and curly hair and hair straighteners that are best for finer, more wavy hair, but it’s rare to find one that works great for both. As the top pick in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this ceramic iron makes short work of most hair textures—former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has one she’s been using on her curls since college, and this is the iron I use on my own unruly 3a curls for daily touch-ups. I also like the maneuverability of the smaller plates and the quick one-minute heating time. —Kat Merck We love Cozy Earth’s bamboo sheets and hoodies, but this pajama set hits new comfort highs—soft and stretchy, smooth and luxurious. My wife has been wearing these pajamas to test them for an upcoming gift guide, and she says they are the best she has ever worn. The big catch with Cozy Earth clothing is the high prices, so this Black Friday sale offering up to 35 percent off is worth a look. The sale price is only on select colors of these pajamas. The Google Pixel 9 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite phones of the year. WIRED Senior Reviews Editor Julian Chokkattu raves about the camera system, smooth OLED displays, and helpful software features you won’t find on other phones. Easily one of the best Android phones you can buy right now, the Pixel 9 Pro only dropped recently, so this is a surprisingly deep and tempting discount. The Pixel 8A is also discounted at $399 ($100 off). This 10-foot cable is long enough to allow you to place your phone where you want while charging (or continue using it without having to crouch near the outlet). It is a durable braided nylon cable from Anker that comes with a lifetime warranty. It can deliver up to 100 watts to fast-charge any phone or tablet and comes with a handy cable tie. You can get it in black or white, but I like the red because it stands out, making it less of a tripping hazard. This is the best long cable in our best USB-C cables guide. The Google Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a good-looking smartwatch with accurate health and fitness capabilities. The bigger 45-mm size offers a day or more of battery life, and the Auto Bedtime Mode is handy when the day is over. This is our pick of the best smartwatches if you have an Android phone, and this is the lowest price we have seen for it yet. Discounts on Oura’s biohacking smart rings are rare, but the Oura Ring Gen3 Horizon dropped in price when the Oura Ring 4 landed, and this discount takes it even lower. This smart ring is our favorite sleep tracker and does a solid job of tracking your activity and stress levels. It packs three hospital-grade sensors: infrared photoplethysmography sensors for heart rate and respiration, a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) sensor for body temperature, and a 3D accelerometer for movement. The app is easy to use, but Oura’s $6-per-month membership is an essential extra cost to get the most from this gadget. This easy-to-build home arcade cabinet features a 17-inch color LCD screen, a light-up marquee, authentic arcade controls, and runs 14 Namco games, including every version of Pac-Man and a few extras like Galaga and Dig Dug. Whether you grew up in the arcades or not, these games still have a powerful addictive hook, and this Pac-Man arcade machine brought me closer to my teen kids. This is a decent discount that drops it to the lowest price we’ve seen. This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. REI's Half Dome tents are some of the best camping tents you can buy, according to WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson, who says this tent is reasonably priced, rugged, and simple to set up, and it offers generous living space for two with gear. The interchangeable poles make for an easy pitch, and it won't add too much weight to your pack, at just under 4 pounds. Happy campers will find more options in our Best REI Black Friday Deals post. Now is the time to procure the best face computer. The Ray-Ban Meta sunglasses are on sale across Meta, Ray-Ban, Best Buy, Target, and Amazon through December 2. I freaking love these things (possibly because I’ve been wearing Ray-Ban Wayfarers for almost two decades) and they’re so useful. You can listen to podcasts on your run! You can take pictures to text to your spouse! You can check if the food cart is open, all without taking out your phone. And as if that weren’t enough, they also shade your eyes. —Adrienne So Universal travel adapters are handy to have on your travels and this affordable adapter from Epicka works in more than 150 countries. Sliders reveal common international plugs for the EU, UK, and US, but you can rotate the pins for sockets in Australia or China. You can plug in power-hungry devices, like laptops and camera batteries, but there are also four USB-A ports on the bottom and a 15-watt USB-C port on the side for phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other small gadgets. It’s not the sturdiest option, but it's cheaper than most of the alternatives. This is the budget pick in our best travel adapters guide and is frequently discounted, but well worth buying at this price. It's described as a men’s travel backpack, but we think anyone will find this bag useful for all kinds of trips. WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe has been using it for six years and loves the storable backpack straps, padded handles, and plethora of pockets. She says it is comfortable and breathable if you're carrying it on your back, and it sports a padded compartment for your laptop, tablet, e-reader, or Nintendo Switch. This may have dipped a couple of bucks lower before. An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck This super svelte smart wallet is durable and provides easy and swift access to your cards, thanks to a trigger button that pops them out of the top. It is made from recycled aluminum and holds four regular cards easily, though you can add more cards or cash using the band around the outside. Ekster also offers a ton of optional add-ons, including a tracker card and a multi-tool. I also love the Ekster Wallet at $62 ($27 off), and the Ekster Grid Backpack for $180 ($45 off) was the perfect way to travel light on my last work trip. Read next Read next

The top 10 performing stocks in the S&P 500 index saw returns of 18% or more since Election Day, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, which analyzed returns based on closing prices from Nov. 5 to Nov. 20. Two companies — Axon Enterprise (AXON), which provides law-enforcement technology, and Tesla (TSLA), the electric-vehicle maker led by Elon Musk, an advisor to President-elect Donald Trump — saw their stocks gain more than 35%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. By contrast, the S&P 500 gained about 2% over the same period. Investors should be cautious about buying individual stocks based on short-term boosts, said Jeremy Goldberg, a certified financial planner, portfolio manager and research analyst at Professional Advisory Services, Inc., which ranked No. 37 on CNBC's annual Financial Advisor 100 list. "It's usually a bad idea," Goldberg said. "Momentum is a powerful force in the market, but relying solely on short-term price moves as an investment strategy is risky." Investors should understand what's driving the movement and whether the factors pushing up a stock price are sustainable, Goldberg said. Lofty stock returns were partly driven by Trump administration policy stances expected to benefit certain companies and industries, investment experts said. Deregulation and a softer view toward mergers and acquisitions are two "key" themes driving bullish sentiment after Trump's win, said Jacob Manoukian, head of U.S. investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Take the energy sector. Analysts expect the Trump administration will be more likely to greenlight oil and gas projects, for example. Trump has called for increasing fossil-fuel production and reversing Biden-era policies to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. He picked Chris Wright, CEO of fracking company Liberty Energy, to head the Department of Energy. More from Personal Finance:The must-have gift of the season may be a 'dupe'Could Trump reinstate the student debt Biden forgave?Most employees don't use this 'triple-tax-free' account EQT Corporation (EQT) — among the biggest U.S. natural gas producers — saw its stock surge 24% from Nov. 5 to Nov. 20, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. It's an example of a company that benefited from the "Trump momentum for energy," Goldberg said. Additionally, U.S. regulators will likely be much less stringent about allowing potential mergers during Trump's second term, experts said. Companies in the streaming ecosystem — like Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which owns the Max streaming service, and Disney+ owner The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) — may be benefactors of looser rules around consolidation, they said. For some stocks, outperformance was tied to rosy quarterly earnings results or guidance that some companies reported around or after Election Day, experts said. Many such businesses cited artificial intelligence as a growth driver. For example, Palantir Technologies (PLTR), cited "unprecedented" demand for its AI platform in the third quarter, helping deliver "exceptionally strong" earnings, Treasurer and CFO David Glazer told investors Nov. 4. Likewise, Axon beat analysts' estimates in its Nov. 7 earnings results, with officials touting its "AI era plan" and raising earnings guidance, Goldberg said. Axon and Palantir stocks were up 38% and 22%, respectively, from Nov. 5 to Nov. 20, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Some companies benefited from a combination of policy and earnings, experts said. Take Vistra Corp. (VST), an energy provider, for example. The company's stock jumped 27% after Election Day. Vistra is in talks with large data centers — or "hyperscalers" — in Texas, Pennsylvania and Ohio to build or upgrade gas and nuclear plants, Stacey Doré, Vistra's chief strategy and sustainability officer, said on the company's Q3 earnings call Nov. 7. Tech companies are building more and more such data centers to fuel the AI revolution — and need to source increasing amounts of energy to run them. And then there's the Elon Musk factor. Tesla's stock got an "Elon Musk premium" from Trump's victory, said Goldberg of Professional Advisory Services. Musk, Tesla's CEO, was one of Trump's top campaign backers. Trump tapped him to co-lead a new Department of Government Efficiency. Shares of the electric-vehicle maker soared 14% the day after the election and almost 30% by week's end. But Tesla stock has additional tailwinds, experts said. For one, Trump wants to end a $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs. Scrapping that policy is expected to hurt Tesla's EV rivals. Tesla has also been developing technology for driverless vehicles. In Tesla's recent earnings call, Musk said he'd use his influence in Trump's administration to establish a "federal approval process for autonomous vehicles." Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Justices dismiss Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data breach dispute

This morning the justices dismissed Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank as “improvidently granted” – that is, without issuing a ruling on the merits, and instead signaling that it was a mistake to grant review. The brief unsigned order leaves in place a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that allowed a securities fraud class action against Meta to go forward on the theory that Facebook’s disclosures improperly downplayed the risks of a data breach to shareholders. The company had disclosed the risk of hypothetical future data breaches, which shareholders argue violated securities law because Cambridge Analytica had already exploited the data of millions of users. When Cambridge’s misuse of user data later became widely known, Facebook’s stock price fell dramatically. At the oral argument, even the more conservative justices seemed skeptical of Facebook’s arguments, so its failure to persuade a majority to rein in the lower court is not surprising. At this point, the case will return to the lower courts, where the action will proceed against Meta.

Title: 3 Nvidia customers have each spent $10 billion on chips this year
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-customers-10-billion-ai-chips-blackwell-1851706059
Time Published: 2024-11-22T18:25:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia’s (NVDA+0.64%) path to becoming the most valuable public company in the world this year has been laid by its artificial intelligence chips and a handful of anonymous customers. Earlier this week, the chipmaker reported $35.1 billion in revenues for its fiscal third quarter, surpassing Wall Street’s expectations. According to the company’s Form 10-Q, 36% of that revenue — or $12.6 billion — came from only three unnamed customers. For the three months ended in October, Customers A, B, and C each accounted for 12% of Nvidia’s quarterly revenue, the filing said. The filing also shows that, in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, sales to Customers B and C each made up 11% of revenue, while a Customer D accounted for 12% of revenue. That means Customers B and C have each spent around $10 billion on Nvidia’s tech so far this year, while Customer D has spent almost $11 billion. Nvidia reported revenues of $26 billion for the fiscal first quarter, and $30 billion for the fiscal second quarter. The sales are primarily attributable to Nvidia’s Compute & Networking segment, according to the filing. In September, Nvidia’s 10-Q regulatory filing showed four anonymous customers made up nearly half of its $30 billion revenues for the second fiscal quarter. Sales from the four customers represented about 46% of total quarterly revenue, or $13.8 billion. “We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia said in both 10-Q filings. Although Nvidia will not disclose the customers, its top buyers are likely to include Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+0.86%), Meta (META+1.47%), Microsoft (MSFT+2.17%), and Tesla (TSLA-0.10%) — all of whom are major players in the AI boom. Nvidia’s record fiscal third-quarter revenue was up 94% from a year ago.

The credit card giant also raised its full-year EPS guidance to between $13.75 and $14.05. In addition, American Express acquired full ownership of Swisscard from UBS, marking a notable business transaction. Analyst responses to these developments have varied. TD Cowen held its rating on American Express shares while raising the price target to $268. Baird increased its price target for American Express to $240 but maintained an underperform rating due to concerns about future revenue growth. BTIG reiterated its sell rating on American Express, maintaining a $230 price target.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped between positive and negative territory, after the major gauges closed Thursday in the green. Markets are regrouping after Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings fell short of definitively settling the question of whether AI would keep boosting stocks. Some of the "Magnificent Seven" tech megacap stocks were under pressure in early trading, also dogged by the potential breakup of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).T The major gauges are still on track to close the week with wins of over 1%, despite getting it off to a lackluster start as the post-election rally stalled. Wall Street is still waiting to learn who Trump will tap for his Treasury Secretary — an announcement that could sway markets, given its importance to the economy. The President-elect tapped former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi to be the US attorney general after his prior pick, Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration on Thursday. Meanwhile, surging bitcoin continued to near the landmark $100,000 level, buoyed by growing confidence that the Trump administration will support pro-crypto policies.

Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports that Advance Magazine Publishers Inc. is offering 7.8 million shares for $145.38 to $148.54 each, which would be valued at as much as $1.2 billion.

Stocks wavered at the open on Friday, but the major averages were still on track to end the week with wins.

Title: SMCI Shares Soar 15.1% Amid Auditor Appointment and Regulatory Resolution

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Super Micro Computer (SMCI, Financial) stock price rose by 15.1% to $29.70 on November 21, 2024, following a series of significant developments. This marked a remarkable recovery and restored investor confidence despite ongoing controversies. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SMCI. The recent surge is coming into the market after SMCI cleared all the compliance issues between it and Nasdaq by appointing BDO USA as their new auditors. This action comes after a somewhat volatile time for the company, which saw its financial reports delayed and the ouster of its prior auditor, Ernst & Young. The appointment of BDO, the fifth largest accounting firm globally, alongside presenting a compliance plan, helped the company put off immediate wipe-out risks, which was a significant achievement in stabilization. The semiconductor industry has received further support from Nvidia's (NVDA, Financial) Q3, FY 2025 results, which depict a healthy demand for AI. Nvidia's results reflected strong revenue and earnings growth and placed a favorable spotlight on system partners such as SMCI. Although Nvidia shares declined on profit selling, the prolonged favorable industry fundamentals and the increase continued driving up the SMCI shares. However, coupled with these developments are some challenges that Super Micros is experiencing, some of which are the accounting fraud allegations made by Hindenburg research early this year. The ability of the company to address these issues while sustaining solid linkages is likely to continue to be an area of interest to investors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. The legendary investor reduced his stake is some very well-known companies. An incoming crypto-friendly regulatory environment for U.S. based companies has renewed optimism for certain tokens, especially XRP. Rather than feeling surprised, you should take advantage of such scenarios to scoop up solid growth stocks on the cheap. Ideally, these businesses should be growing their revenue and profits and generating positive free cash flow. Most importantly, these growth stocks should possess catalysts that help them post sustainable growth in the years ahead. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is reporting tremendous demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). It supplies these chips for gaming, data centers, automotive, and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers. All that demand is generating plenty of excess revenue for Nvidia and the company is looking for ways to put that money to good use. This eVTOL aircraft maker could have a bright future. Nowhere is that more apparent than the stunning rise of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks, a collection known for its strong ties to the technology. Billionaire investors have taken notice, and many hold positions in the Magnificent Seven stocks. Among these closely watched billionaires is Philippe Laffont, who made a name for himself by building Coatue Management into the world's best-known tech-centric hedge fund, parlaying a $50 million investment in 1999 into $27 billion in assets under management. BioLineRx (BLRX) and Ayrmid, the parent company of Gamida Cell (GMDA), announced that the companies entered into a license agreement for motixafortide, BioLineRx’s FDA-approved stem cell mobilization agent indicated in combination with filgrastim for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. Under the terms of the agreement, BioLineRx granted Ayrmid an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Aphexda across all indications, excluding solid tumo Rising costs of living and shrinking savings force millions of Americans to consider retiring overseas. Last year, data from the Social Security Administration showed that about 450,000 people received benefits outside the U.S. as of the end of 2021, ... W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC) currently sits more than 15% below its 52-week high. The weakness in its share price is a big reason the real estate investment trust (REIT) offers a dividend yield above 6%. The diversified REIT's high-yielding dividend should steadily rise in the future. Three brand-name businesses are perfectly positioned to become Wall Street's premier stock splits in the new year.

We recently published a list of 14 AI News Updates Wall Street Is Monitoring. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates Wall Street is monitoring. Merely days after Donald Trump won a tightly-contested election for the top office in the US, Elon Musk, one of his most prominent backers, received further good news as xAI, the AI startup he founded in 2023, raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion. News publication The Wall Street Journal reported that Valor Equity Partners, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz were part of the raise, while the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar also participated in the funding process. This set of investors had also backed the startup with $6 billion in funding earlier this year. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. xAI has developed Grok, one of the leading AI chatbots in the world. It rivals the performance of chatbots from tech powerhouses with far greater resources. The firm also controls Colossus, one of the most powerful supercomputers globally. The supercomputer will become fully operational by the end of this year and Musk plans on expanding the hardware at the center of this endeavor to 200,000 GPUs. Last year, the startup also released PromptIDE, an integrated development environment designed for prompt engineering and interpretability research.

On November 20, Loop Capital maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $175 price. In an investor note, the advisory noted that there has been increased noise throughout the Gen AI ecosystem of late, but analysis suggests that Nvidia’s anticipated demand trajectory remains intact. The note further detailed that GB200 NVL72 at material volume was really a July-September 2025 event, but it may not matter much as the amount of increased Hopper production may outweigh the amount of Blackwell forgone by the push out. Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI news updates Wall Street is monitoring. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Washington Post has descended into a dark abyss — here’s why
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/business/washington-post-has-descended-into-a-dark-abyss/
Time Published: 2024-11-22T12:00:00Z

The Washington Post used to be one of the best gigs in journalism. No longer. In a business where it generally sucks to be an employee (except for the NY Post, of course), the “WaPo,” as it is known in journalism circles, has really descended into the abyss, On The Money has learned. Top reporters want out of what they see as crappy new work conditions and possibly more layoffs coming. It’s a shame, of course. The paper and its journalists — think Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and their dogged pursuit of Watergate — set the gold standard for reporting. They are the reason so many went into the business, including yours truly. Sure, Woodward remains at the paper, as do many amazing reporters. But the decline of print as a viable business model, plus the leftward lurch of a new generation of ink-stained wretches that turns off readers, has decimated readership — and the paper’s balance sheet. The Post changed hands years ago from the Graham family to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He’s one of the world’s richest men, but he hates losing money, people who know him tell On The Money. That includes the tens of millions a year he’s sinking into the paper. Bezos brought in new management this year like publisher Will Lewis, a WSJ alum (the WSJ and the NY Post share common ownership), to de-woke the place and help it at the very least break even. But it’s either not working or not working well enough to satisfy Bezos’ desire to stop throwing good money after bad, people close to him say That’s why in addition to financial discipline (some recent layoffs, and possibly more in the future), Lewis is demanding some personal discipline as well. Since COVID, many reporters have been working from home. Now, the company wants them back in the office five days a week starting next June, according to an internal memo. That might also have the effect of culling staff (and cutting those losses) because reporters who live in the ‘burbs might just quit rather than come back to work in downtown DC. Resumes have been flying out of the place faster than Donald Trump can say “They’re eating the cats,” these people add.

Never miss a story. “Work is tense right now,” said one WaPo reporter. “Everyone is upset that a return-to-office policy is coming. Many don’t live in the area anymore and it’s unclear if they’ll have a job anymore.” The problem is there aren’t many places to go. Reporters are finding that they’re getting low-balled on salaries because rivals aren’t doing that much better and they see a distressed trade in the making, the Wall Street equivalent of picking up talent during a fire sale. A WaPo press official had no immediate comment.

If the future is anything like the last five years, not even a crystal ball could prepare investors for what's ahead. Anyone who had known heading into 2020 that a once-a-century pandemic was imminent likely would have unloaded all of their risk assets and braced for a years-long economic contraction. But that would have been a massive mistake, as a brief global downturn during the health crisis soon yielded to a booming economic recovery. Global markets are up around 50% in the last half decade while GDP growth has surged and US corporate earnings have risen roughly 70%. "Markets have had a 'roaring 20s' — with five years of strong performance for global equity market indices, technological breakthroughs, and stronger-than-expected US economic growth," strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management (GWM) recently wrote. Although it's impossible to predict what's next and how markets will respond, the team at UBS GWM gave it a shot in their 2025 outlook report, which was released on November 21. A key focus of the report is how the global economy may be at a pivot point, following a surge in populist sentiment that culminated in the election of Donald Trump earlier this month. While Wall Street is confident that there will be a continued boom under Trump, UBS GWM is less sure. This new political regime "might extend or end the Roaring 20s," strategists remarked. What happens may depend in large part on what happens with Trump's tariff policy. "A tariff shock could trigger a stagflationary downside scenario," UBS GWM strategists said. "At the same time, negotiations with trading partners or domestic legal challenges might mitigate their scope and impact, and tax cuts and deregulation could support a more positive market narrative." With that in mind, UBS GWM is preaching humility and portfolio diversification to its clients. After all, investors have seen how troubling global events can coincide with rallies, and vice versa. "We have to be prepared for a wide range of outcomes in the year ahead," Mark Haefele, UBS GWM's chief investment officer, said in a statement. There are four potential templates that markets could follow in 2025, in UBS GWM's view. UBS GWM thinks the most likely outcome is that the US economy will continue to grow, even as tariffs are implemented, due to deregulation and bright sentiment from business leaders. In this backdrop, the S&P 500 could rise to 6,600, provided that inflation and interest rates also fall. "The prospect of lower taxes and deregulation adding to a positive 'Roaring 20s' market narrative built on solid growth, and continued investment in AI" has led to optimism in markets, Haefele noted. An even more upbeat view is that the S&P 500 will soar to 7,000 thanks to exceptionally strong economic growth and continued excitement about artificial intelligence, all with minimal inflation. Stocks would also benefit from lower taxes, fewer regulations, and trade deals that minimize the pain that tariffs could bring. Interest rate cuts would be the icing on the cake. Investors will most likely be satisfied at the end of next year, UBS GWM believes, as the firm assigned a 50% likelihood to its base case and a 25% chance to the bull scenario. However, there's about a one in four chance that next year is marked by major market losses. A so-called "tariff shock" scenario has about a 15% chance of happening, and it could send the S&P 500 tumbling to 5,100 as a burgeoning trade war sends inflation higher while crushing global growth. In this backdrop, it's hard to see how US stocks could dodge heavy losses. "The risk scenario is that trade tariffs, excessive fiscal deficits, and geopolitical strife will contribute to higher inflation, weaker growth, and market volatility," UBS GWN strategists said. Tariffs are far from the only risk to markets. An old-fashioned recession featuring a weaker jobs market and softer consumer spending could send the S&P 500 all the way back to 4,500. Although there's no way to know which of those four outcomes will occur, UBS GWM spotlighted eight investments that are likely to appreciate. Technology stocks are among the firm's top ideas, including semiconductor firms and companies tied to artificial intelligence. Tariffs could weigh on growth, but the sector's long-term growth story is likely intact regardless of what happens on the political policy front. "AI infrastructure spending remains robust, and we expect key semiconductor components needed for AI to remain supply constrained in 2025, supporting pricing," UBS GWM strategists wrote. Utilities are also a less heralded way to ride AI momentum, UBS GWM noted, plus the group is defensive and could hold up better in a bearish scenario. "Although utilities companies with high renewables exposure could face near-term pressures, we also expect significant growth in AI data centers to fuel power demand, leading to higher power prices," UBS GWM strategists wrote. The other sector that UBS GWM highlighted is financials, which has handily outperformed the market in the last month. Strategists are confident that the group has more room to run. "We expect Fed rate cuts to lead to lower funding costs, higher loan growth, and more capital market activity," UBS GWM strategists wrote. "Following the US election, we also expect the financial sector to benefit from deregulation." In international markets, the firm is bullish on Asian stocks outside of Japan as interest rates fall in the region. Additionally, small- and mid-sized European stocks — which are relatively cheap — should benefit from solid economic growth and lower rates, though tariffs are a risk. Outside of equities, UBS GWM recommends high-quality bonds while interest rates fall. Bond yields have risen lately on the back of Trump's win, since investors now expect higher growth, inflation, and budget deficits. This may be a good time to lock in higher rates, UBS GWM said. "We believe investment-grade bonds offer attractive yields and expect mid-single-digit returns in US dollar terms," UBS GWM strategists wrote. Precious metals are also worth owning, UBS GWM said. Gold can continue to rise to $2,900 next year, in the firm's view — and copper, lithium, and nickel also appear to have upside. "In 2025, we believe gold will remain an effective hedge against key political concerns, including government debt levels, inflation, or geopolitical tensions," UBS GWM strategists wrote. Lastly, investors should have exposure to real estate, in light of lower interest rates, limited supply, and healthy demand. Residential and commercial properties both make sense, though UBS GWM specifically cited property types like logistics, data centers, and multifamily housing. Jump to

Title: Gene Munster Is Bullish, Talks About Pressure Points on Nvidia’s (NVDA) Earnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster shared his views about NVIDIA (NVDA)'s earnings call yesterday. Here is a summary of his thoughts: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s earnings report provides insight into the company’s growth trajectory, highlighting the aspects that matter and those that don’t. The company delivered $35 billion in revenue for the October quarter, meeting whisper numbers, and issued a January guidance of $37.5 billion, slightly below the whisper number of $38 billion. Gross margins dipped a bit too, but ultimately these numbers don't matter as much. The AI star lies in a boom or bust industry. Before the generative AI excitement, the company’s business declined 21% year-over-year. However, Nvidia’s market cap has skyrocketed since, driven by the extraordinary demand for its Blackwell GPUs. The true pressure point for Nvidia lies in the commentary about Blackwell, Nvidia’s generative AI architecture. Looking at the key commentary from Nvidia’s CFO, we find that demand for Blackwell will continue to exceed supply for several quarters. There have also been some supply difficulties, albeit quite small. This narrative has evolved positively compared to the October earnings call, with supply constraints expected to ease slightly earlier—from “into 2025” to “mid-2025.” Additionally, the earnings call mentions twice that the demand for Blackwell has grown even stronger over the past three months, setting up 2025 as a robust year. While this doesn’t provide complete visibility into 2026, it does base a strong foundation for continued momentum. Driving Nvidia’s growth is the principle of scaling laws. Scaling is what's effectively needed to make AI models smarter. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, likened this to Moore’s Law, where CPU speeds doubled every few years even though it was expected otherwise. The industry’s continuous innovation and adherence to scaling principles are bound to propel Nvidia’s AI computing demand, reinforcing the long-term outlook. Wall Street projects 20% year-over-year growth for calendar year 2026. Based on Nvidia’s trajectory, Deepwater anticipates this could accelerate to over 30% growth, stating that there is plenty of time for the business to appreciate. Our research director shared his views on NVDA's earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
