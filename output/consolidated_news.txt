Crypto institutional investors ramp up inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs following a swift recovery and expected price consolidation. The last seven days saw a net jump in total digital asset products alongside soaring trading volumes. As institutional sentiment spikes, traders are primed for a run above $100k, although certain macro indicators could hinder the upward drive. On-chain data shows spot Bitcoin ETFs added $1.8 billion, triggering bullish sentiments in the last seven days. This comes from renewed speculation for a massive price jump in May. Following the last dip and the recovery, which kicked off in the previous two weeks, traders began high-end accumulations seeking to break new positions. Traditional investors also caught the wave as they shifted through gears. According to SoSoValue data, net inflows topped $40.25 billion on May 2, marking the highest level since Feb 11. These products gained traction after the previous two months as the White House lowered tariff pressure. The previous week saw a much larger $3 billion inflow coming off a string of outflows. Currently, bull pressures are backed by new centralized institutions increasing their appetite for the asset class. Firms like Strategy and Metaplanet have intensified acquisitions in the same period. Last month, Cantor, Tether, SoftBank, and Bitfinex announced plans to roll out a Bitcoin acquisition firm. This influx of institutional demand has shaped trader confidence as they aim for new cycle peaks. Per pseudonymous Bitcoin enthusiast BlockChair, metrics are strengthening due to huge ETF inflows. “Institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to accelerate. With spot ETFs absorbing 6x the weekly mined supply and BlackRock dominating holdings, the supply squeeze narrative grows stronger. A 2% BTC allocation across traditional portfolios would indeed be transformative.” For most digital asset commentators, the next point is another push through the $95k price to set the tone for a larger $100k level. After swings in the past few months, this psychological level remains important for Bitcoin holders. Bitcoin price dropped 22% from an all-time high above $108k, ushering in fresh outflows in the wider market. If the price reclaims $100k this month, bulls’ projections could be in play due to skyrocketing institutional inflows and on-chain metrics. Long-term holders are back in the green zone, spiking new retail investors.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File photo Uber Technologies missed quarterly revenue estimates as growth in its ride-hailing unit slowed to its weakest since the pandemic, stirring fears of slowing demand against the backdrop of a murky economic outlook and clouding an upbeat forecast. Shares of the company fell about 8 per cent before clawing back some ground to be down 5 per cent in premarket trading on Wednesday. Total revenue rose 14 per cent to $11.53 billion in the first quarter, compared with analysts' expectations of $11.62 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Uber has struggled to match the high growth from the post-pandemic quarters and is also contending with lower ride prices with some customers seeking cheaper transport options.

Title: Facebook stole my book to train its AI. The insult wasn't the money
URL: https://qz.com/meta-facebook-ai-mark-zuckerberg-books-llama-theft-1851779221
Time Published: 2025-05-07T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
It started with an email from my literary agent. “You might’ve heard about LibGen and books being used to train AI,” she wrote. “A search of the database shows that Poe for Your Problems is on the list.” I had seen the headline, back in March, in The Atlantic: “Meta (META) pirated millions of books to train its AI,” it screamed. But to my shame, I hadn’t actually read the piece. I had been too busy writing for Quartz (as now) and chasing my four-year-old around the house. Life goes on, even when someone steals your intellectual property. Yet there it was. The story detailed how Meta employees had downloaded tens of gigabytes of pirated books from LibGen, a well-known “shadow library” that hosts roughly eight million titles. They used these files to help train LLaMA 3, the company’s most advanced language model. Internal discussions, unsealed earlier this year as part of an ongoing lawsuit, show that Meta’s engineers explicitly debated the legal risks and chose to proceed anyway, looking to save both time and money. The documents further suggest that top leadership signed off on the maneuver. “Eventually, the team at Meta got permission from ‘MZ’ — an apparent reference to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — to download and use the data set,” The Atlantic reported. In response, a group of authors including Sarah Silverman have filed a class action lawsuit, now winding its way through the legal system. Instead, I was relieved. My little book had been deemed important enough to steal! Thank goodness. The greater shame would’ve been not being pirated, considering the scale of the theft. I turned to a friend who happened to be standing nearby and said, “It’s just nice to be included.” If that seems like a perverse reaction, well, it conveys how humbling it can be to achieve your lifelong author dreams. Many people dream of publishing a book someday — I had since I was eight years old — but becoming an author is a lesson in humility, at least in my experience. You show up at a bookstore to give a reading to five people, two of whom are your dad’s cousins. You do podcast interviews in which the host greets you with, “So I haven’t had time to read your book… can you remind me what it’s about and who you are?” Like I said: humbling. But the relief quickly curdled as I remembered what it had been like to sell the book in the first place. Nonfiction is sold on proposal — which means you don’t write the book, you write a 40-page business plan for the book. I spent years on mine, rewriting it three separate times. I got upwards of two dozen rejections before it finally went to auction and found a home with a Hachette subsidiary in 2019. After that, it took another year to write the actual book. When it came out in 2021, I spent thousands of hours promoting it. My advance was $20,000 — not nothing. But that was before taxes and my agent’s 15% cut. I once calculated that I’d earned less than the federal minimum wage for writing the book. Since it “earned out” in 2023 (meaning the publisher fully made back its costs), I’ve received another $10,000 in royalties. Those checks are always welcome, but they’re also pre-tax couch change compared to the time, energy, and ambition that went into the work. It’s hard to explain just how difficult it is to land a publishing deal, especially with one of the “Big Four.” Unless you’re an Obama or a Kardashian, it’s nearly impossible. Publishing is a perpetually precarious industry, surviving year to year on breakout hits like Atomic Habits or It Ends With Us. Even the largest publishers operate on net margins of about 6%. That doesn’t leave much room for risk. So they’re understandably reluctant to bet on an unproven author with an odd idea. I got around the issue of not being famous myself by writing about someone who was: my literary hero, Edgar Allan Poe. But that didn’t make things easy. Selling a self-help book based on the life of history’s most miserable writer was, perhaps unsurprisingly, an uphill battle. And while my genre — irreverent self-help, sometimes called “anti-self-help” — is relatively common now, it wasn’t when I was knocking on doors, metaphorical hat in hand. Putting together a convincing business case was hard enough. Writing the actual book — 55,000 words of deeply researched, counterintuitive argument — was harder still. “To coin one’s brain into silver, at the nod of a master, is to my thinking, the hardest task in the world,” Poe once wrote. It’s no less true when you’re the master, too. Today, Amazon sells my book for $12.99. My cut of that is $2.25. And that’s too steep a price tag for Meta? A company worth $1.5 trillion, helmed by a founder with a $200 billion net worth? Mark Zuckerberg owns about 13% of Meta stock. He could’ve paid me $2.25 — the amount I earn per sale — almost 89 billion times. Or he could’ve just bought a single copy, which would’ve cost him 0.0000011% of his wealth. Assuming a $20 sticker price on each of the 7.5 million pirated books, actually paying for all of them would’ve cost about $150 million — not even one-tenth of one percent of Zuckerberg’s fortune. Me? I would’ve come out $2.25 better. I could’ve bought a Snickers, depending on the gas station. Surely the world’s third-richest man could swing that. If you want to understand the artist’s dilemma in the AI age, it’s this: Do something singular, something that takes years of obsessive creative labor — then watch it get stolen by someone for whom $150 million is a rounding error. In that light, it’s not just theft. It’s bullying. Exploitation. Looting on a grand scale. The stuff of Upton Sinclair. Only we don’t have robber barons anymore. We have pirate captains. Bluebeards of the human heart. And what are we supposed to fight them with? Carefully worded emails? That’s like bringing a spork to a nuclear war. Some authors think publishers should be the ones leading the charge. “I checked one of the sites,” the novelist Domenica Ruta told me, “and yes, both my former books were used to train AI. I’m furious and feel utterly powerless about what to do. My take is that publishers — who absolutely have the resources — need to be the frontline defenders against this. They need to protect their authors and our work. As individuals we have little power. A Big Four publisher has a lot more influence.” When Facebook came to power and popularity circa 2010, we at least understood the bargain: In exchange for our data, we got to post above-average-cute photos of ourselves, and learn our relatives’ reprehensible political views. The calculation has shifted since, with Meta stealing something much more intimate, deeply personal, and hard-won than data. If I’d plagiarized someone’s book, I’d be in trouble. I’d go to court, face consequences, quite likely be publicly shamed. That’s not what’s happening to Zuckerberg. Instead, he hangs out at the White House. If you walked into Barnes & Noble and stole a $13 book, you’d get the police called on you. But steal 7.5 million, and you’ll make billions. It’s an object lesson in contemporary law enforcement: the bigger the crime, the more likely you are to get away with it. By the same token, shoplift some disposable razors and you’re a menace, a criminal. Steal 7.5 million books and you’re a visionary. That’s the math now. People love to obsess about thefts of toothpaste and Tide Pods at CVS (CVS) in San Francisco, but plunder on an epic scale just slightly further south and you’ll not only walk away untouched, you’ll emerge vastly richer. It’s hard to think this wasn’t Meta’s whole calculus to begin with. Gamble big, make billions, and let the lawsuits drag on. A lawyer friend of mine put it plainly: The copyright cases are about to enter discovery in both New York and California, and Meta is likely to lose. But by then, the damage will be done. As they said, “No one loves to read more than lawyers and judges.” In the meantime, the industry is already eyeing a workaround by lobbying the executive branch directly. Here’s the part I really hate to say: I don’t think they can be stopped either, whatever the class action lawsuit does. Facebook has faced down governments. It’s currently facing down the FTC and the European Union. And beyond Facebook, vast as it is, there’s the whole AI wave we’re all riding, if unequally. Companies like Meta, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are likely to reap long-term trillions by creating AI tools and programs. I’ve covered the stock market for more than a decade and I’ve never seen economic logic so relentless. Meanwhile, artists and white-collar workers are losing their livelihoods on top of the knowledge and ingenuity that’s already been stolen from them. To coin one’s brain into silver — and watch it be scraped by AI — is enough to make you question the point of doing it in the first place. Lest I seem knee-jerk anti-capitalist, I should add that I come at all this as an author and a shareholder. Checking my Etrade (MS) just now, I see I own about $31,000 in Meta stock. That’s in a regular, non-retirement brokerage account and doesn’t include shares I own indirectly through index and mutual funds. I started buying the stock circa the IPO because I’ve long recognized the wealth-creation dynamics of our era: Hard work may or may not pay off, but invest in companies like Meta and you can ride along for the extra-legal wealth they’re likely to create. It’s the surer thing. So I don’t begrudge Meta its $16.4 billion quarterly profit, not necessarily. But as a shareholder, I don’t want it earned through theft. And as a writer, I feel the same way. You want so badly to enter the cultural DNA. But if it means you get erased, robbed, exploited? Not so much. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Life goes on, even when someone steals your intellectual property. Yet there it was. The story detailed how Meta employees had downloaded tens of gigabytes of pirated books from LibGen, a well-known “shadow library” that hosts roughly eight million titles. They used these files to help train LLaMA 3, the company’s most advanced language model. Internal discussions, unsealed earlier this year as part of an ongoing lawsuit, show that Meta’s engineers explicitly debated the legal risks and chose to proceed anyway, looking to save both time and money. The documents further suggest that top leadership signed off on the maneuver. “Eventually, the team at Meta got permission from ‘MZ’ — an apparent reference to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — to download and use the data set,” The Atlantic reported. In response, a group of authors including Sarah Silverman have filed a class action lawsuit, now winding its way through the legal system. Instead, I was relieved. My little book had been deemed important enough to steal! Thank goodness. The greater shame would’ve been not being pirated, considering the scale of the theft. I turned to a friend who happened to be standing nearby and said, “It’s just nice to be included.” If that seems like a perverse reaction, well, it conveys how humbling it can be to achieve your lifelong author dreams. Many people dream of publishing a book someday — I had since I was eight years old — but becoming an author is a lesson in humility, at least in my experience. You show up at a bookstore to give a reading to five people, two of whom are your dad’s cousins. You do podcast interviews in which the host greets you with, “So I haven’t had time to read your book… can you remind me what it’s about and who you are?” Like I said: humbling. But the relief quickly curdled as I remembered what it had been like to sell the book in the first place. Nonfiction is sold on proposal — which means you don’t write the book, you write a 40-page business plan for the book. I spent years on mine, rewriting it three separate times. I got upwards of two dozen rejections before it finally went to auction and found a home with a Hachette subsidiary in 2019. After that, it took another year to write the actual book. When it came out in 2021, I spent thousands of hours promoting it. My advance was $20,000 — not nothing. But that was before taxes and my agent’s 15% cut. I once calculated that I’d earned less than the federal minimum wage for writing the book. Since it “earned out” in 2023 (meaning the publisher fully made back its costs), I’ve received another $10,000 in royalties. Those checks are always welcome, but they’re also pre-tax couch change compared to the time, energy, and ambition that went into the work. It’s hard to explain just how difficult it is to land a publishing deal, especially with one of the “Big Four.” Unless you’re an Obama or a Kardashian, it’s nearly impossible. Publishing is a perpetually precarious industry, surviving year to year on breakout hits like Atomic Habits or It Ends With Us. Even the largest publishers operate on net margins of about 6%. That doesn’t leave much room for risk. So they’re understandably reluctant to bet on an unproven author with an odd idea. I got around the issue of not being famous myself by writing about someone who was: my literary hero, Edgar Allan Poe. But that didn’t make things easy. Selling a self-help book based on the life of history’s most miserable writer was, perhaps unsurprisingly, an uphill battle. And while my genre — irreverent self-help, sometimes called “anti-self-help” — is relatively common now, it wasn’t when I was knocking on doors, metaphorical hat in hand. Putting together a convincing business case was hard enough. Writing the actual book — 55,000 words of deeply researched, counterintuitive argument — was harder still. “To coin one’s brain into silver, at the nod of a master, is to my thinking, the hardest task in the world,” Poe once wrote. It’s no less true when you’re the master, too. Today, Amazon sells my book for $12.99. My cut of that is $2.25. And that’s too steep a price tag for Meta? A company worth $1.5 trillion, helmed by a founder with a $200 billion net worth? Mark Zuckerberg owns about 13% of Meta stock. He could’ve paid me $2.25 — the amount I earn per sale — almost 89 billion times. Or he could’ve just bought a single copy, which would’ve cost him 0.0000011% of his wealth. Assuming a $20 sticker price on each of the 7.5 million pirated books, actually paying for all of them would’ve cost about $150 million — not even one-tenth of one percent of Zuckerberg’s fortune. Me? I would’ve come out $2.25 better. I could’ve bought a Snickers, depending on the gas station. Surely the world’s third-richest man could swing that. If you want to understand the artist’s dilemma in the AI age, it’s this: Do something singular, something that takes years of obsessive creative labor — then watch it get stolen by someone for whom $150 million is a rounding error. In that light, it’s not just theft. It’s bullying. Exploitation. Looting on a grand scale. The stuff of Upton Sinclair. Only we don’t have robber barons anymore. We have pirate captains. Bluebeards of the human heart. And what are we supposed to fight them with? Carefully worded emails? That’s like bringing a spork to a nuclear war. Some authors think publishers should be the ones leading the charge. “I checked one of the sites,” the novelist Domenica Ruta told me, “and yes, both my former books were used to train AI. I’m furious and feel utterly powerless about what to do. My take is that publishers — who absolutely have the resources — need to be the frontline defenders against this. They need to protect their authors and our work. As individuals we have little power. A Big Four publisher has a lot more influence.” When Facebook came to power and popularity circa 2010, we at least understood the bargain: In exchange for our data, we got to post above-average-cute photos of ourselves, and learn our relatives’ reprehensible political views. The calculation has shifted since, with Meta stealing something much more intimate, deeply personal, and hard-won than data. If I’d plagiarized someone’s book, I’d be in trouble. I’d go to court, face consequences, quite likely be publicly shamed. That’s not what’s happening to Zuckerberg. Instead, he hangs out at the White House. If you walked into Barnes & Noble and stole a $13 book, you’d get the police called on you. But steal 7.5 million, and you’ll make billions. It’s an object lesson in contemporary law enforcement: the bigger the crime, the more likely you are to get away with it. By the same token, shoplift some disposable razors and you’re a menace, a criminal. Steal 7.5 million books and you’re a visionary. That’s the math now. People love to obsess about thefts of toothpaste and Tide Pods at CVS (CVS) in San Francisco, but plunder on an epic scale just slightly further south and you’ll not only walk away untouched, you’ll emerge vastly richer. It’s hard to think this wasn’t Meta’s whole calculus to begin with. Gamble big, make billions, and let the lawsuits drag on. A lawyer friend of mine put it plainly: The copyright cases are about to enter discovery in both New York and California, and Meta is likely to lose. But by then, the damage will be done. As they said, “No one loves to read more than lawyers and judges.” In the meantime, the industry is already eyeing a workaround by lobbying the executive branch directly. Here’s the part I really hate to say: I don’t think they can be stopped either, whatever the class action lawsuit does. Facebook has faced down governments. It’s currently facing down the FTC and the European Union. And beyond Facebook, vast as it is, there’s the whole AI wave we’re all riding, if unequally. Companies like Meta, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are likely to reap long-term trillions by creating AI tools and programs. I’ve covered the stock market for more than a decade and I’ve never seen economic logic so relentless. Meanwhile, artists and white-collar workers are losing their livelihoods on top of the knowledge and ingenuity that’s already been stolen from them. To coin one’s brain into silver — and watch it be scraped by AI — is enough to make you question the point of doing it in the first place. Lest I seem knee-jerk anti-capitalist, I should add that I come at all this as an author and a shareholder. Checking my Etrade (MS) just now, I see I own about $31,000 in Meta stock. That’s in a regular, non-retirement brokerage account and doesn’t include shares I own indirectly through index and mutual funds. I started buying the stock circa the IPO because I’ve long recognized the wealth-creation dynamics of our era: Hard work may or may not pay off, but invest in companies like Meta and you can ride along for the extra-legal wealth they’re likely to create. It’s the surer thing. So I don’t begrudge Meta its $16.4 billion quarterly profit, not necessarily. But as a shareholder, I don’t want it earned through theft. And as a writer, I feel the same way. You want so badly to enter the cultural DNA. But if it means you get erased, robbed, exploited? Not so much. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Business FILE PHOTO: Dark clouds are seen over the building of the European Central Bank (ECB) before the ECB's monetary policy meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, June 6, 2024. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo LONDON : The rush to cut interest rates at major central banks slowed to a trickle in April, as policymakers faced uncertainty on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the wake of escalating trade tensions. Two of the five central banks overseeing the 10 most heavily traded currencies that held meetings in April - the European Central Bank and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand – lowered interest rates by a cumulative 50 basis points. Rate setters in Australia, Japan and Canada left benchmarks unchanged, while central banks in Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, Britain and the United States did not meet in April. In February, half of the G10 central banks cut interest rates. The main focus now shifts to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which concludes its rate setting meeting later on Wednesday.

Title: IBIT acquires 5,613 BTC worth $530M in one day – Details and effects!

Is BlackRock triggering the next crypto bull run? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has reignited investor momentum with a powerful streak of 15 straight days of inflows. This has simply underscored renewed institutional confidence in Bitcoin [BTC]. On 5 May alone, the asset manager acquired 5,613 BTC, valued at approximately $530 million – Solidifying IBIT’s dominance in a week where most other ETFs saw flat or negative flows. With total inflows since inception now surpassing $44 billion, BlackRock’s aggressive accumulation reinforces its outsized influence on the broader crypto ETF landscape. It also means that institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure remains strong. Remarking on the same, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas took to X and noted, “Deja vu in the weekly flows w/ $VOO and $IBIT in the top spots, just like last year when ‘beta with a side of bitcoin’ was the big theme. $IBIT now 8th in YTD flows (was out of Top 50 at one point) with +$6.4b. Been hoovering up btc like a madman ever since the decoupling.” In the thread, he further added, “One interesting note also is $IBIT taking in SO much more then the rest of them (altho 10 of them have seen inflows). Usually there’s much more parity tho. Why is this? My theory, return of the HF basis trade and some big fish biting after the decoupling and subsequent rally.” Additionally, Bitcoin’s stability above the $90,000 threshold, even after a modest 0.42% dip in the last 24 hours, alluded to growing confidence in the asset’s long-term trajectory. This price level, once seen as highly ambitious, now might be a stepping stone towards the psychological $100,000-mark. Notably, key technical indicators such as the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) were in bullish territory at press time. This reinforced the idea that short-term dips may be part of a healthy consolidation phase, rather than a reversal. Source: Trading View Additionally, BlackRock’s IBIT has been seeing renewed investor appetite for quite some time too. Even on 24 April, IBIT recorded massive inflows worth $442 million. Needless to say, Blackrock’s success is not just limited to Bitcoin. Even in the case of Ethereum [ETH], Blackrock’s ETHA has been the reason behind the cumulative inflows spot ETH ETFs have been getting. The scale of institutional influx is a sign that market participants may be positioning for another leg up. It also further strengthens the case for a sustained rally in the coming weeks.

Title: Spiritans accused of putting own interests before those of abuse victims

The Spiritan congregation has been accused of putting its own interests, needs and concerns before survivors of abuse in schools run by them. The Restore Together advocacy group for survivors of abuse in Spiritan-run schools has said: “Our experience is that the Spiritans have failed at every stage, from the time of the abuse onwards, to put the interests and rights of victims/survivors first. The Spiritans have invariably put their interests, needs and concerns and those of the institution first.” The accusation is in a lengthy letter written on behalf of the group by survivor Philip Feddis, who attended Blackrock College. Last month it was sent to past pupils’ unions at Blackrock College, Willow Park, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College, all in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. Easter, it said, was “a time for Spiritan priests to reflect on the adequacy of their response to child sex abuse”. The “victim/survivor experience” involving Spiritans was “not one of compassion”, it said. “Victims/survivors feel frustrated, disappointed, angry and worse. The ongoing delay in implementing the comprehensive restorative programme has increased the suffering of victims/survivors in many ways. It is not compassionate, it is cruel.” It pointed out that “a comprehensive, victim-centred redress scheme and a testimony-gathering (truth-telling) project has still not been delivered and the Spiritans have made no commitment to a start date for either. This is completely unacceptable to victims/survivors; most of us are over 60, who have already waited far too long for justice.” [ Spiritans have paid €8.8m in settlements to 125 abuse survivors since 1998Opens in new window ] Because of the age factor, “urgent delivery is vital for the success of these redress and testimony programmes”, the letter said. “A constant refrain is that victims/survivors are tired. We are tired of being ignored and marginalised. We are tired of feeling betrayed and abandoned by institutions that were supposed to protect and care for us as children.” It noted how “Restore Together recently called on the Spiritans to finalise the redress scheme without further delay and have it up and running no later than June 1st this year. The Spiritans have not responded to this call. We in Restore Together have been more than patient.” Survivors, the group said, are “tired of having to fight and push the Spiritans every step of the way to fully and comprehensively face up to the issue of child sex abuse in their schools and `do the right thing’. We are tired of being told we will have to wait.” The “historic power imbalance that we as victims/survivors experienced as children and which facilitated our abuse is still present and underpinning the current situation. This compounds the suffering of victims/survivors and has to be ended for once and for all. The Spiritans must take all immediate steps to bring justice to victims/survivors without having to be pushed every step of the way to do so,” it said.

Title: A county pension fund in Pennsylvania just became the first known to cease purchasing new Tesla stocks

A swing county in Pennsylvania has decided it will no longer purchase new Tesla stock, citing CEO Elon Musk's political activities and the company's declining shares. Lehigh County, which is toward the east of Pennsylvania and has a relatively affluent population, has a county pension board that oversees $500 million in assets. It's the first known US pension fund to stop purchasing new Tesla stock. "Elon Musk's choice to become a political figure rather than a customer-focused leader has compromised the Tesla brand," Mark Pinsley, the Lehigh County controller who first introduced a motion to cease Tesla investments, said in a joint statement with organizers of Tesla Takedown. "Tesla's earnings are down 71% from a year ago, their auto revenues have dropped 20%, and profitability has taken a sharp dive," Pinsley added. "We owe it to our retirees and taxpayers to take a hard look at whether these are wise investments at this time." On Tuesday, the board not only voted to hit the brakes on new Tesla investments in a 4-2 decision, but it also directed the county's investment manager to draft a report outlining options to divest its passively managed funds from Tesla. The Lehigh County Controller's Office and Tesla didn't immediately respond to requests for comments. Pinsley and the retirement board of Lehigh County aren't the only ones concerned about pensions invested in Tesla. In March, a group of 51 New York State legislators called on the state to divest its $1 billion in Tesla holdings. A top contender in the New York City comptroller race has pledged to pull the city's $300 billion pension portfolio out of Tesla if elected. Brad Lander, the current New York City comptroller, has also been vocal about his dissatisfaction with Musk's leadership, but he stopped short of calling for a divestment in his office's latest response to Business Insider in April. The city's five public pension systems held more than 3 million Tesla shares worth about $1.26 billion on December 31, yet this figure had shrunk to $831 million by March 28, according to the comptroller's office. In April, eight state treasurers wrote a joint letter to Tesla's board to express concern over Musk's lack of focus on Tesla, and the American Federation of Teachers is pressing major asset managers — including BlackRock and Vanguard — to consider divestment. Beyond the US border, the Netherlands' largest pension fund offloaded its $600 million stake in Tesla in January. Denmark's $20 billion pension fund, AkademikerPension, followed suit in March. Recently, Canada's largest public-sector union also urged national pension funds to cut ties with Tesla, though divestments have yet to happen. Tesla has been facing growing pressure over Musk's governance of the company and his political activity. The Tesla Takedown movement that emerged in protest of Musk's involvement in the White House DOGE office is looking to evolve beyond demonstrations. The movement's next goal is to help cities and states develop resolutions to divest in "all things Musk," according to a statement on April 22 after Tesla reported earnings. As of Tuesday, Tesla stock has declined more than 27% since the beginning of 2025, and its Q1 revenue missed expectations. Musk announced during the latest earnings call that he would be stepping back from his political activities at the White House. Marketing experts previously told BI that Tesla had alienated its core customer base and that rebranding efforts might require significant concessions from Musk. "To some degree, Musk can say, 'I don't care because I'm so rich and I've got so many other entities that I could afford to lose a lot of money.'" David J. Reibstein, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School, previously told BI. "But for the other shareholders who are bailing on the company, that's problematic." Jump to

Title: Grant Cardone Says, 'America About To Have Greatest Resurgence In Its 250-Year History,' Thanks Trump For Encouraging Big Tech To Come Home

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Entrepreneur Grant Cardone is celebrating what he calls the beginning of America’s biggest comeback ever, thanks to President Donald Trump’s push to bring tech manufacturing back to the U.S. Cardone posted on X after Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang joined Trump at the White House on Wednesday to announce a massive new chip investment. “America is about to have its greatest resurgence in its 250 year history. Thank you President Trump for ‘encouraging' big tech to come home,” Cardone wrote, sharing a video of Huang’s remarks. Don't Miss: Mode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. Earning Opportunity for All Smartphone Users Mode EarnPhone State-of-the-art smartphone device includes built-in earning features. EarnOS Proprietary earning software turns smartphones into EarnPhones. During the event, Trump introduced Huang as “the founder, CEO and president of NVIDIA,” and said he was producing up to $500 billion worth of the most powerful AI chips over the next four years—all to be manufactured in the U.S. for the first time ever. Huang said, “NVIDIA reinvented computing for the first time after 60 years,” noting that modern computer design hasn’t changed much since IBM’s System/360 in the 1960s. But the new AI chips are a big leap forward. “That GPU—that’s one GPU unit—it’s 70 pounds, 60,000 parts, 10,000 watts,” Huang said. “Just to test a superchip requires a supercomputer.” Trending: Donald Trump just announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal — here's how you can invest in the entertainment market's next big disruptor at $2.25 per share. Huang credited Trump for pushing manufacturing to happen in the U.S. “Without the president’s leadership, his policies, his support, and very importantly, his strong encouragement … manufacturing in the United States wouldn’t have accelerated to this pace,” he said. He emphasized that making these chips isn’t about cheap labor—it’s about advanced tech, robotics, and AI. Nvidia will also use its Omniverse digital twin technology to help build cutting-edge factories on U.S. soil. “This new industry is a manufacturing industry in itself,” Huang said. “We now have the backing of the administration, the backing of President Trump, to support the creation of a whole new industry.” See Also: Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary called Missing Ring his biggest mistake — Don't repeat history—invest in RYSE at just $1.90/share. Huang said the AI infrastructure being built in the U.S. will power breakthroughs in healthcare, financial services, drug discovery, education, and more. “This computer is the engine of a whole new industry,” he said. “Electricity goes into this machine and incredible tokens come out—artificial intelligence.” Nvidia’s partnership with the Trump administration may be shaping up to be a key turning point in bringing high-tech manufacturing back to the U.S., and Cardone believes it could mark the beginning of a historic economic transformation.

Wednesday, 07 May 2025 NEW YORK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors sifted through a wave of corporate earnings while looking ahead to developments on trade talks and the outcome of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which began earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 389.83 points, or 0.95 percent, to 40,829.00. The S&P 500 dropped 43.47 points, or 0.77 percent, to 5,606.91, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 154.58 points, or 0.87 percent, to finish at 17,689.66. Nine of the eleven S&P 500 sectors ended in negative territory, led by healthcare and consumer discretionary, which declined 2.76 percent and 0.85 percent, respectively. Utilities and energy were the only sectors to post gains, up 1.23 percent and 0.10 percent. Stocks seesawed on Tuesday following a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, their first formal negotiation session since Carney recently took office. During the meeting, Trump dialed back earlier optimism about impending trade agreements, stating bluntly, "We don't have to sign deals." The remark marked a sharp reversal from his Sunday comments, when he suggested multiple deals could be finalized as soon as this week. Investors are now turning their attention to the Federal Reserve, which is not expected to change its benchmark interest rate this week. However, markets are eagerly awaiting Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Wednesday, particularly his views on how the Trump administration's tariff policies may be influencing the broader economic outlook. "Despite external pressure to lower rates, the Fed will likely hold strong on the current pause until we see greater clarity on the major economic factors impacting the economy," said Steve Rick, chief economist at TruStage. "As the impacts of tariffs settle in, we still broadly expect the economy to continue to shift towards a slower pace of growth than in recent months." Earnings reports drove notable stock movements on Tuesday. Palantir plunged 12.05 percent, making it the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, despite meeting first-quarter earnings expectations and providing a positive forecast. In contrast, Constellation Energy surged 10.29 percent after beating revenue estimates, fueled by rising electricity demand linked to AI infrastructure growth. Ford Motor gained 2.65 percent after surpassing quarterly profit estimates, though it withdrew its full-year guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty. Mattel also climbed 2.78 percent as it suspended its outlook and announced price hikes in response to tariffs. Large-cap tech stocks, which had recently driven much of the market's rally, faced selling pressure. Tesla and Meta Platforms both declined by about 2 percent, while Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Broadcom, Apple and Nvidia also lost ground. Thank you for your report!

Title: Supermicro Stock Drops as Server Maker Lowers Its Revenue Outlook

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) cut its full-year revenue outlook, sending shares lower in extended trading Tuesday. The server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner said it now expects fiscal 2025 revenue of $21.8 billion to $22.6 billion, down from its prior range of $23.5 billion to $25 billion. Supermicro shares fell over 6% in after-hours trading following the release. For the fiscal third quarter, Supermicro posted revenue of $4.6 billion, up nearly 20% year-over-year and at the high end of its significantly reduced forecast. Adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share fell from 66 cents per share a year earlier. Supermicro said it anticipates fourth-quarter sales of $5.6 billion to $6.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 40 cents to 50 cents. CEO Charles Liang said some Supermicro clients delayed making product decisions during the period, which pushed sales beyond the fiscal third quarter. “We do expect many of those commitments to land in the June and September quarters, reinforcing my confidence in our ability to meet our long-term targets, however economic uncertainty and tariff impacts may have a short-term impact,” Liang said. Supermicro shares have seen significant volatility this year as concerns about the company's accounting practices and delayed filings raised worries it could be delisted from the Nasdaq. The company ultimately met the exchange’s deadline to file its delayed reports in February, but still faces challenges, including uncertainty around how it could be affected by shifting tariff policies.

Title: The 7 Best Diaper Bags, According To Moms Who’ve Tested Over 20 Styles
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-diaper-bag/
Time Published: 2025-05-06T20:52:55Z
Full Content:
Before I had my first baby, I don’t think I truly understood how many things I would need to carry around with them whenever we left the house. The best diaper bags have the space to stow all those baby essentials like wipes, diapers, bottles, spare clothes, burp cloths and toys. They’re also comfortable and easy for parents to use, so you’re not digging through the diaper bag abyss to find that elusive pacifier. After testing over 20 diaper bags among several testers, we found the Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack to be the best—it’s made of high-quality materials and has dedicated pockets for all the essentials. Our top value pick, the popular Skip Hop Forma Diaper Bag Backpack, is lightweight, roomy and has remained durable through years of testing. The best diaper bags hold and organize everything you need for your little. Here are all of our winners after testing over 20 diaper bags: When choosing a diaper bag, consider the size and style you want. If you have multiple kids, you may need a larger bag—but be careful not to overload it. Additionally, many parents prefer a backpack or belt bag, so they can have their hands free. “A comfortable, well-designed and ergonomic diaper bag that meets your specific needs can improve quality of life as you navigate the daily demands of motherhood,” says Amy McCormick, an occupational therapist who leads the postpartum rehabilitation program at UNC Rex Holly Springs Hospital in North Carolina. Continue reading for an in-depth look at all of our top picks for the best diaper bags along with more information on our testing process and what to look for when you’re shopping for a diaper bag. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 13.4 x 6.7 x 13.8 inches | Weight: 1.3 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: A 100% guarantee on hardware and fabric defects for two years | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: With 10 total pockets, the Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack makes it simple to find a spot for all your baby items and then some. From a discreet felt-lined electronics pocket to stretchy diaper pockets and an insulated bottle pocket, there’s a place to put everything. The large main compartment zippers all the way down, which helps with packing the bag and finding things that may have fallen to the bottom. A strap on the back that attaches to rolling luggage makes it a great option for travel, too. It’s also the lightest diaper bag backpack that we tested. The Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack is just the right size for essentials. Many of the more stylish diaper bags I’ve tested are either uncomfortable or have fabrics that are difficult to maintain and clean. That isn’t the case with this bag. Depending on the style you choose, the outer material is either vegan leather, coated canvas or vegan leather with cable-stitch textured embossing. The styles are classic and professional, making this a good option to bring to work if you’re pumping or simply want to continue to use the bag after your baby is older. Though the bag isn’t machine washable, the materials are easy to wipe clean. Our tester intentionally spilled a blueberry pouch on the bag and left it to sit overnight. In the morning, it wiped up effortlessly. The included changing pad is machine washable, so there’s no need to worry about messy diaper changes. The comfort of this bag is a huge plus, too. It’s a backpack-style bag, which many of our experts recommend. The padded straps are nice and comfortable. “When worn properly, with both straps well positioned, [backpack bags] can help minimize risk of injury and reduce stress on the back, abdominals, and pelvic floor,” says McCormick., Though I laud the bag for its ample pockets, you can’t pack quite as much in this bag as some of our other top picks, like the Skip Hop Forma or the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag. When I try to put too many things in the bag, it becomes lumpy and awkward because there isn’t much give to the material. Our tester also found that the side water bottle pocket was difficult to pack when there were too many things in the main compartment. However, that limit on space is a good thing in some ways. “More space just means more stuff crammed inside—and trust us, you don’t need to carry everything but the kitchen sink,” says Laura Hunter, a licensed practical nurse and cofounder of Moms on Call, a parenting resource brand. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 16 x 8 x 14 inches | Weight: 1.4 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: Limited warranty | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: The value of the Skip Hop Forma Diaper Bag Backpack is unmatched. My husband and I have used it as our main diaper bag for over five years, and it’s still in excellent shape. The bag has two padded straps and it’s a backpack bag, making it the ideal ergonomic option. Because it’s a backpack bag that’s incredibly lightweight, this is a good option for parents have back problems or moms who may struggle with core strength, pelvic floor strength or who are recovering from a c-section or tear. “Postpartum moms should consider their core and pelvic health when choosing a diaper bag. After a vaginal birth, weakened pelvic floor muscles and potential back pain mean a lightweight, evenly distributed bag (like a backpack style) is ideal to reduce strain. For c-section recovery, avoiding heavy shoulder bags that put pressure on healing abdominal muscles is crucial,” says John Gallucci Jr., a doctor of physical therapy and CEO of New York-based Jag Physical Therapy. The Skip Hop Forma is a great value option that's durable and easy to pack. I like packing this bag more than some of the more stylish or boxy bags because the material has some give to it. There are nine total pockets, plus two packing cubes. Pockets include two bottle pockets, a main compartment, two stretchy interior pockets, two front zipper pockets and more. The bag also comes with a changing pad. The side bottle pockets have plenty of room to hold water bottles for parents and caregivers or babies. The storage cubes are great for packing things on-the-go, too. If I want to leave the larger diaper bag in the car, I can put a bottle, diaper and some wipes in a packing cube and significantly lighten my load. McCormick likes the option of using removable storage cubes, too, as they make it easy to add and remove items based on the specific outing or activity. The fabric is water-repellent, and our tester found it easy to clean a spilled baby food pouch and water. In addition to being able to wipe down any spills, I’ve also found that it’s easy to clean out crumbs and messes at the bottom of the bag because the fabric has enough flexibility to it that I can turn the bag inside out. Dagne Dover Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 9.5 x 5.6 x 12.3 inches (small), 11.8 x 6.5 x 12.8 inches (medium, 12.3 x 7 x 13.8 (large) | Weight: 3 pounds (small), 3.5 pounds (medium), 4 pounds (large)| Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: Limited guarantee for 1 year | Cleaning instructions: Hand wash Best for: Skip if: The Dagne Dover Indi Diaper Backpack comes in small, medium and large sizes, so parents can find the right option for their carrying style. In addition to the many interior and exterior pockets, including a wipes and insulated bottle holder, it also comes with extras like a storage pouch and a shoe bag. A luggage sleeve on the back makes this a good option for travel, too. Other extras include a changing mat and stroller clips, though we don’t recommend using stroller clips due to the potential danger of tipping the stroller. If you tend to overpack your bag, you might want to get the size larger than you think you’ll need. Our tester found that when she had the main compartment of the bag packed full, it was difficult to use the exterior zipper pockets. The fabric on the Dagne Dover Indi is so comfortable and soft. Many people love the look and feel of the Indi. The neoprene material is 100% vegan, and it’s available in a variety of aesthetic colors, some of which are gender-neutral. From the outside, it looks more like a regular backpack than a diaper bag. The fabric is soft, not stiff, and the nicely padded straps make it comfortable to wear. Our tester found that the fabric stretches easily to accommodate items that you throw in the bag. If you (or your kids) tend to spill things a lot, this may not be the best bag for you. When our tester spilled water and a tot food pouch on the bag, it initially cleaned up well, but in the long-term, she found some stains lingered on her camel-colored bag. Béis Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 12 x 7.75 x 15 inches | Weight: 4 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 45-day return policy | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: Some people like to overstuff their diaper bag (guilty as charged). Whether you’re packing for twins like me or just need extra space, the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag gives you the room you need. The top of the bag opens wide so you can pack and find the things you need, and there are a good number of pockets. Our tester found that the exterior bottle pockets were large enough to hold her water bottles, which wasn’t the case with every bag she tested. Inside, you can tighten the insulated bottle pouch so your baby’s bottle doesn’t get lost in the main compartment. Because it’s such a big bag and it already weighs 4 pounds, be careful not to overpack it. “Extremely large or heavy bags may encourage overpacking, making it hard to reach items and adding unnecessary strain to the back, abdominals and pelvic floor,” says McCormick. Though the bag can get heavy if you stuff too much in it, our tester found it comfortable with nicely padded straps. My favorite thing about the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag is that it’s obvious it was thoroughly designed with babies and parents in mind. The included changing pad has a pouch to store diapers, wipes or diaper rash cream. In the bag, you’ll find a pacifier pouch and a teething ring. There is also an odor-proof pouch, which is ideal for storing soiled clothes or for parents who use cloth diapers to store dirty diapers until they get home. Another included extra is stroller clips, though we do not recommend using these as the weight of the bag can tip your stroller. Our tester loved all of these extras as well as how easy the bag is to clean. The stain-resistant fabric can be wiped down. She had no problem cleaning up the food pouch that she intentionally spilled on the bag. The high-quality and easy-to-clean material makes this a great pick for families with multiple kids or those who want a durable bag that can stand up to extensive everyday use. Caraa Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 12.3 x 12 x 5 inches (medium), 13 x 12.8 x 5.8 (large) | Weight: 2.5 pounds (medium), 3 pounds (large) | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 21 day return period, manufacturing defects are assessed on a case by case basis | Cleaning instructions: Machine washable (black), clean with mild neutral soap mixed with warm water and a clean microfiber cloth (all other colors) Best for: Skip if: Becoming a parent doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice your style or your love for luxury products. The Caraa Baby Bag is made with parent and baby in mind, with so many thoughtful features. Forbes Vetted editor Margaret Badore found that this bag had the best features of all the high-end bags she tested. She particularly likes the hot/cold pocket and the fully removable diaper caddy. The caddy has four pockets for storing wipes, diapers and other essentials, and it’s a helpful feature for packing a few things on the go. “The removable organizer is also extremely useful; when packed with diaper change essentials, I could take just that part out and head to the bathroom with baby for a change,” says Badore. Unfortunately, the bag does not come with a changing pad to complement the diaper caddy. One of my favorite baby-friendly features: the black version of the bag is machine washable, which isn’t a common feature in diaper bags. No matter the spill, you can throw it in the wash for quick cleanup. For other color options, you need to clean with mild neutral soap mixed with warm water and a clean microfiber cloth to maintain the color. The Caraa Baby Bag can be worn as a backpack or a cross-body bag. The bag is available in a medium or large size, and the versatility is key. You can choose to wear the bag as a backpack or as a crossbody bag by attaching a shoulder strap. When you wear it this way, you can tuck the backpack straps out of the way. The bag also comes with stroller hooks, but we don’t recommend using them because hanging a bag on your stroller can cause it to tip. This bag has so many pockets. From insulated bottle pockets to a phone pocket to hot/cold pockets and pockets with magnetic closures, you’ll certainly find a spot to put everything. When you’re traveling, simply slide the bag onto your luggage with the attached luggage sleeve. Badore has used this bag for about two years, including on family trips and as a carry-on, and has found virtually no signs of wear. The profile of this bag is a bit wider than many others, so that’s something to consider if you need your bag to fit into a compact area. State Bags Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 16.5 x 13 x 5.9 inches | Weight: 1.9 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 1 year for material or manufacturing defects | Cleaning instructions: Spot clean with a damp cloth Best for: Skip if: A gender neutral diaper bag is ideal if you’ll be sharing the bag with other caregivers—or perhaps you simply prefer that look and style. From the outside, the State Lorimer Diaper Bag doesn’t scream diaper bag, and it’s available in five colors, including the several gender-neutral picks like an olive, black and navy. You can personalize the bag with up to three characters and two symbols or patches. The padded straps are nice, and Badore found the bag comfortable even when it was loaded up. When traveling, you can also attach the bag to your luggage with a built-in luggage slip. The fabric is easy to clean. In our tests, water ran right off the nylon parts, and our spilled pouch wiped up no problem. Badore appreciates all of the pockets in this bag, which include two main compartments, a front zipper pocket, side water bottle pockets, an insulated bottle pocket and more. With so many places to put things, it’s less likely you’ll lose something at the bottom of the bag. It also includes a washable changing pad and a padded laptop sleeve that fits laptops up to 15 inches. For parents who sometimes have to work while taking care of their kids, this can be a huge plus. Though there is plenty of room for all of the essentials, the large size of this bag could encourage you to pack too much, which could put extra stain on your back. This can also be dangerous if you use the attached stroller clips as a heavy diaper bag could tip a stroller. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 6.5 x 7 x 4 inches | Weight: 2 pounds | Bag style: Belt bag | Warranty: Limited warranty for 1 year | Cleaning instructions: Machine washable Best for: Skip if: I really couldn’t ask for much more in a compact diaper bag. The Colugo On-The-Go Organizer is sleek, comfortable and highly adjustable. According to Hunter, small and compact is the way to go. “Moms on Call recommends smaller, well-organized bags that keep only the essentials at your fingertips. Some other features we can do without,” she says. The bag has enough room for the basics like diapers and wipes. It has six pockets plus two bottle holders, so you can keep your items organized, too. Our tester was surprised at how many things she could fit in the bag. It also had room for her son’s sweatshirt. The Colugo On The Go Organizer is ideal for staying hands-free while carrying all the essentials. My favorite thing about this bag is that it can double as a stroller organizer. While hanging larger, heavier bags from a stroller is unsafe due to the potential for tipping, I don’t worry about that with such a small bag. In fact, the bag is designed to be a stroller organizer first, diaper bag second. It’s nice to be able to just grab the bag and go when you need to park your stroller or leave it somewhere unattended. The versatility makes the price just right, too. You’re getting two products in one. I appreciate machine-washable diaper bags like this one, because with three kids, sometimes I don’t realize a spill happened until well after the fact. It wipes down easily, too. Our tester spilled the majority of a water bottle in the bag and found that it dried easily and didn’t get things stored in other pockets wet. The bag is simple to adjust and comfortable. I don’t have to fiddle with the straps too much to get them where I want them. Other crossbody or belt bags that I’ve tested feel too boxy or bulky, but I didn’t find that with this one. The strap also has a pretty wide range, meaning it can work for caregivers of various sizes. Over several years, we’ve tested more than 20 diaper bags among three mom testers. We included our favorites in the guide and continue to test additional bags as they become available. Here are the others we’ve tested: Freshly Picked Classic Diaper Bag: I’ve had this bag for years, and I really like the style and look of it. However, it’s pretty boxy, and it doesn’t offer as many organization options as other bags. Another tester also found that it started to fray almost immediately, which made us question the high price tag. BabbleRoo Diaper Bag Backpack: This is a budget-friendly diaper bag that is available in many colors and styles. It also has a lot of useful pockets, like a pacifier pouch and three insulated bottle pockets. It wasn’t as comfortable as some of the other bags we tested, and our tester found it difficult to pack the bag with everything she needed. Ruvalino Diaper Bag Backpack: This popular bag is well-loved for its low price. However, it’s somewhat bulky and stiff. It was also a bit more difficult to clean than many other bags we tested. We enjoyed the variety of pockets and were able to pack a lot into the bag. Herschel Baby Strand Sprout Shoulder Bag: Though this is more of a minimalistic bag, there is plenty of space inside. Our tester really liked the included changing pad. Unfortunately, it lacks many of the features of our top picks and our tester wasn’t able to find a comfortable way to carry the bag. Eddie Bauer Cascade Back Pack Diaper Bag: There are plenty of features packed into this diaper bag like a wipes pocket, insulated bottle pocket and changing pad. However, it’s not as user-friendly as we’d like. It can be difficult to reach the bottom of the main compartment and our tester found that the diaper pockets weren’t wide enough. Béis The Diaper Pack: This bag has some nice features like a changing pad and a convenient wipes pocket. It’s also pretty spacious for a belt bag. However, I found it too boxy and bulky. The main dealbreaker was that when worn as a belt bag, I couldn’t get the straps small enough. Parents and caregivers with slim frames may struggle to get the bag tight enough to stay on. Dagne Dover Ace: Those searching for something extra minimalistic might like this fanny pack diaper bag—but it just didn’t have enough features or space for us. Storq Quick Change Fanny Pack : Though this bag is a good size for a belt bag, it doesn’t have the organization features necessary to store the amount of baby gear you can fit in a bag. We like that it’s lightweight and machine washable. Ditty Co. Small Diaper Bag: This belt bag is comfortable and machine washable with an affordable price that matches it size. It might work for some families who prefer to pack light, but we wanted more space. Luli Baby Monaco Sling Bag: This sling bag has nice features given its smaller package, such as a pacifier holder and a phone pocket. It’s more complicated to adjust and get items out of than other bags we tested, though, and when you’re juggling babies and all their things, you don’t want a bag that makes things more difficult. State Jordan Diaper Bag: We were able to fit plenty of things in this bag and liked the organizing pouches and changing pad. However, we didn’t find the shoulder strap very comfortable, especially when compared to backpack style diaper bags. BagSmart Walker 25L Featherlight Travel Diaper Backpack: There are a lot of features in this bag that we appreciated, like the large insulated bottle pocket and the waterproof laundry pouch. What our tester didn’t like was that many of these features don’t quite work the way they should. For example, the insulated bottle pouch didn’t fit many popular bottle brands, and it was hard to get diapers to fit into the diaper pouches. JuJuBe B.F.F. Diaper Bag: You can wear this bag as a backpack, messenger bag or shoulder bag—but our tester didn’t find it comfortable to wear, and it wasn’t quite big enough to fit all of our supplies. We also tested the Petunia Pickle Bottom Mini Bag and the Kibou Fanny Pack Diaper Bag. The Petunia Pickle Bottom Mini Bag is no longer in stock, and though the Kibou Fanny Pack Diaper Bag was our previous pick for the best diaper belt bag, the bag has since been discontinued. What we’re testing next: We’re continuing to test two No Reception bags, two Calpak diaper bags, including the Calpak Diaper Backpack With Laptop Sleeve, and plan to consider the new Away diaper bag collection as well as Uppababy’s Changing Backpack, among others. We’ve spent years testing diaper bags and between myself and two other testers, we’ve tested over 20 bags. For this round of testing in 2025, myself and baby and kids gear editor Margaret Badore tested a combined 11 bags, and some bags have been tested by multiple families. We tested the diaper bags in real-world situations, like daycare drop-offs, family outings and trips to the pediatrician’s office. Here’s a peek at what we looked for when we tested bags: The best diaper bags make it easier for you to get out and about with your kids. Here are some factors to consider when shopping for a diaper bag. The three most common types of diaper bags are backpack, fanny pack or belt bags and shoulder or tote bags. Many parents and caregivers want a diaper bag that fits their style as it can become an extension of themselves for quite a few years. Don’t forget to consider the preferences of your partner or other caregivers, too. While you might love a stylish floral print bag, another caregiver you’ll be sharing the bag with might not. Ergonomics are incredibly important, particularly for new moms. After delivery, moms might face weakened abdominal muscles and a weakened pelvic floor. They might also be recovering from a c-section or a perineal tear. For any parent or caregiver, an ergonomic diaper bag can help reduce the risk of developing back, neck and shoulder pain. Some ergonomic features to look for include wide, padded backpack straps that allow you to evenly distribute weight, structured bags that maintain their shape while wearing them and adjustable straps. Choosing a lightweight bag and limiting how much you pack can be beneficial, too. “It’s important that all moms choose a diaper bag that is lightweight and adjustable to safely distribute weight and support healing of the pelvic floor and abdominals that are often compromised from the strain endured during both pregnancy and childbirth,” says McCormick. “Moms experiencing postural changes or diastasis recti should prioritize ergonomic designs that prevent excessive forward hunching,” adds Gallucci. “Ultimately, a well-balanced, adjustable bag can help reduce discomfort and support postpartum recovery.” Diaper bags can have many features. Some helpful ones include insulated pockets, changing pads, diaper pockets, wipe pockets, device pockets, storage cubes or pouches and clips for keys and toys. “Durable and easy-to-clean materials can hold up to everyday use, make messes quick to resolve with less stress, and prevent caregiver fatigue by allowing the bag to be set down without concern for damage,” says McCormick. While some bags are machine washable, most are water-resistant and can be wiped clean. I’m a parenting writer, product tester and mom to three, and I cover baby and kids gear for Forbes Vetted. I’ve been testing baby, kids and parenting products for seven years, and I’ve tested many diaper bags on this list, some of which I’ve used for years. I test a wide range of products, from the best toys for 6-month-olds to the best strollers. In addition to testing products for this article, I also spoke to other parents and testers about which diaper bags they liked, conducted in-depth research, compared features of the diaper bags and interviewed four experts. Those experts include: At its core, a diaper bag is simply a place to carry baby essentials while you’re out and about. You can use a purse, backpack or any other type of bag as a diaper bag. However, many diaper bags have convenient features such as insulated bottle pockets, wipes pouches and elastic diaper storage pockets. They’re designed to carry all your baby essentials and often come with built-in changing pads, too. Prices of diaper bags can range from around $20 to over $200. Many durable and comfortable diaper bags fall in the $75 to $100 range. You might pay a bit more for something that’s more stylish or made of higher-end materials. When it comes to a diaper bag, the lighter, the better. As you add more things into the bag, it can get heavy, causing back and neck strain. Most diaper bags are 4 pounds or less with some belt bags weighing under a pound.

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(Millions except per share amounts and percentages) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(Millions) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(Millions) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.SELECTED CORPORATE DATA(Millions) (Unaudited) (1) The Company operates as three operating segments, Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded segments.The Data Center segment primarily includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators, server microprocessors (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerated processing units (APUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers.The Client and Gaming segment primarily includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks, and discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services.The Embedded segment primarily includes embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. All Other category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments, such as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturer and restructuring charges. (2) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, inventory loss at contract manufacturer, acquisition-related and other costs, and restructuring charges. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. (3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.

Title: $330B Bitcoin Corporate Surge? Why BTC Bull Token Could Be Poised to Benefit
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/330b-bitcoin-corporate-surge-btc-bull-token-to-benefit/
Time Published: 2025-05-06T20:00:07Z
Full Content:
Bernstein predicts that corporate treasuries could hold $330B worth of Bitcoin by 2029. That prediction indicates an ongoing change of heart from Wall Street — and could prime BTC Bull token to explode in 2025. Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, used to be a Bitcoin critic. Now, Blackrock offers $IBIT, the largest Bitcoin ETF on the market, controlling $55B of the $116B Spot Bitcoin AUM (assets under management). Bernstein’s latest report projects a staggering $330B in corporate Bitcoin holdings by 2029, a figure that underscores the growing role of $BTC in mainstream finance. According to Bernstein’s research, companies worldwide could allocate up to 5% of their treasuries to Bitcoin by 2029, translating to an estimated $330 billion inflow. That trajectory – Bitcoin as a strategic asset, rather than just another kind of tech stock – marks a dramatic turnaround. If sovereign wealth funds sink 3-5% of their assets into Bitcoin, the crypto’s price could reach astronomically high levels; $700K, per an earlier Fink prediction. The question remains: are funds buying Bitcoin? Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) certainly is. It continues to amass Bitcoin at a prodigious rate. After snapping up another 1,800+ Bitcoin, the company holds 555,450 $BTC. There will eventually be only 21M Bitcoin, so Strategy already holds a little over 1 out of every 42 potential tokens. Put another way, the stated goal of the US Bitcoin Treasury is to purchase 1M Bitcoin. Saylor’s already halfway there by himself. Strategy’s stock has grown 2,476% since buying its first Bitcoin in August 2020, validating Saylor’s increasingly aggressive approach to purchasing Bitcoin. The key to Bitcoin’s success will be if it continues to decouple from equities. And if Bitcoin gets even close to that $700K mark, then another group of crypto investors will have already made huge gains – anyone who owns BTC Bull token, one of the best crypto to buy now. How can average investors compete with institutions that can drop billions into Bitcoin treasuries? With BTC Bull token ($BTCBULL), there’s a way. $BTCBULL is designed to give everyday crypto enthusiasts leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s market movements, without the complexity of managing futures or options. $BTCBULL uses two simple tokenomics tools to tie $BTCBULL’s performance to Bitcoin’s growth. Both tools are triggered whenever Bitcoin reaches key price milestones. Those milestones occur every time Bitcoin’s price reaches an all-time high, in $25K increments up to $250K. Of course, if Bernstein’s prediction is correct, then the team behind BTC Bull might have severely undershot with their project’s goals. Regardless, $BTCBULL token holders gain three ways to earn from the project: The project has already raised $5.3M, with a current token price of $0.0025. Our analysis shows that the token price could reach $0.06467 by the end of the year, with the potential for even greater gains if Bitcoin accelerates rapidly. Learn how to buy BTC Bull token, and visit the presale page today. As institutional Bitcoin adoption grows, retail investors seek vehicles that maximize their upside potential. $BTCBULL is perfectly positioned to fill that gap, offering amplified returns tied directly to Bitcoin’s price movements. And the better Bitcoin does, the better the outlook for the best altcoins, which will also benefit from market momentum. Always do your own research. This is not financial advice, and the crypto market remains highly volatile. With bullish momentum across the market and growing mainstream acceptance, projects like BTCBULL could become key players for traders aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin’s next growth cycle.

LipoJaro Ingredients Breakdown Exploring the Natural Compounds That Power LipoJaro LipoJaro’s formula is built on a blend of natural ingredients selected to support the body’s fat metabolism, appetite regulation, and digestive balance—without the use of stimulants. This focus aligns with 2025’s clean-label movement and the shift toward non-GMO, plant-based supplements for weight management. Below is a closer look at each of the key ingredients in LipoJaro and how they may contribute to a more sustainable wellness routine. While individual results will vary, the inclusion of these compounds is grounded in a combination of traditional use and emerging scientific research. Disclaimer: The following ingredient descriptions are for informational purposes only and are not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease. Consult your healthcare provider before beginning any supplement. Glucomannan Glucomannan is a water-soluble dietary fiber derived from the root of the konjac plant. Once ingested, it expands in the stomach by absorbing water, which may create a sensation of fullness and reduce overall calorie intake. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) CLA is a type of fatty acid found in meat and dairy products, though LipoJaro uses a plant-derived version. CLA has been studied for its potential to promote fat oxidation and preserve lean body mass. Green Tea Extract Green tea extract contains catechins—especially EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate)—that are associated with fat-burning and antioxidant support. Garcinia Cambogia Derived from a tropical fruit, garcinia cambogia contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which has been explored for its potential role in suppressing appetite and reducing fat storage. Chromium Chromium is a trace mineral that may play a role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Black Pepper Extract (BioPerine®) Black pepper extract is often added to enhance nutrient absorption. It improves bioavailability, making other ingredients in the formula more effective. Additional Botanicals and Synergistic Compounds While the primary ingredients carry most of the functional benefits, LipoJaro may also include supportive compounds such as: These additions are designed to round out the supplement and enhance its total impact over time. Designed for Ingredient Transparency LipoJaro’s formulation avoids artificial additives, preservatives, and synthetic fillers. Each capsule reflects the brand’s focus on quality, third-party testing, and manufacturing in GMP-certified facilities. Disclaimer: Effects are not guaranteed and may vary depending on the individual. Always verify ingredient labels for allergies or contraindications. No more jitters. Just results. Shop LipoJaro today and start your journey to better appetite control and metabolism—risk-free for 60 days! Reported Side Effects and Safety Considerations What to Know Before Starting LipoJaro While LipoJaro is marketed as a non-stimulant, natural weight management supplement, understanding its potential side effects and overall safety profile is important for informed use. Based on the formulation and user-reported feedback, most individuals tolerate the product well when taken as directed. That said, it's essential to explore how the body might initially respond to the active compounds, especially for first-time users or those with underlying health conditions. LipoJaro is formulated without common stimulants like caffeine or synephrine, which are often responsible for jitteriness, rapid heart rate, or sleep disturbances in traditional fat burners. Instead, it relies on a combination of fiber-rich and fat metabolism-supportive ingredients such as glucomannan, green tea extract, and CLA. These are generally considered gentle on the system, but they may cause mild digestive changes for some users during the adjustment period. Possible Mild Reactions Reported by Users Some individuals may experience: These effects are typically transient and tend to subside after the first few days of consistent use. Drinking adequate water when taking LipoJaro is essential for optimal fiber expansion and to prevent gastrointestinal discomfort. Disclaimer: These potential side effects are not experienced by everyone. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any new supplement, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, have a medical condition, or are taking prescription medications. Who Should Avoid Taking LipoJaro? Although LipoJaro is generally well-tolerated, there are cases where it may not be advisable. It may not be appropriate for individuals who: Because the supplement works partly by expanding in the stomach to help control appetite, it’simportant to take it with at least 8 oz of water. Taking it dry or without adequate hydration could result in discomfort or choking risk. A Clean-Label Alternative for Sensitive Users Compared to many over-the-counter weight loss products, LipoJaro offers a gentler approach—free of synthetic stimulants, harsh laxatives, or artificial colors and preservatives. This makes it appealing to those who have experienced side effects from stimulant-heavy formulas in the past or who prefer a cleaner supplement experience. As with any supplement, the best approach is to start slowly, listen to your body, and maintain open communication with a healthcare provider. LipoJaro's formula is designed for daily use, but it’s always smart to monitor how it fits into your personal health routine. Ready to ditch the crash diets?

Real User Results: What People Are Saying A Closer Look at the Lived Experience Behind the Label When evaluating a supplement like LipoJaro, it's not enough to simply review the ingredient list—real-world feedback from actual users offers some of the most valuable insight into what the product can or cannot do. Many people considering a non-stimulant fat burner want to know: Does LipoJaro actually work? What kinds of results can I expect? Are users satisfied with their outcomes? Across public reviews, feedback platforms, and testimonials shared on the official website, user impressions of LipoJaro show a mix of positive momentum and realistic expectations. While individual results vary, many users report benefits such as improved portion control, reduced cravings, more balanced energy levels, and modest but noticeable body composition changes when paired with healthy habits. Reported Positive Outcomes Common positive experiences include: For some individuals, the impact was not dramatic in the first few days, but became more noticeable with consistent use over two to three weeks. This gradual shift aligns with the supplement's intended purpose—supporting long-term metabolic and appetite regulation rather than forcing aggressive short-term weight loss. “After struggling with portion control for years, I finally feel like I’m in charge of my hunger instead of the other way around. LipoJaro made a big difference for me.” — Verified User Review “I wanted something without caffeine or jittery side effects. LipoJaro didn’t give me a quick fix, but it helped me stay consistent and avoid the late-night snacking that always ruined my progress.” — Verified Buyer Experience Realistic Expectations and Moderate Feedback While many users express satisfaction, some note that LipoJaro did not deliver drastic results on its own, especially without any dietary or exercise adjustments. A few reviewers mention needing to increase their water intake or adjust meal timing to better coordinate with the supplement. Others express the desire for quicker visual results, though they acknowledge the formula's stimulant-free nature and emphasis on sustainability over speed. Key Takeaways from User Feedback Disclaimer: Testimonials reflect individual experiences and are not guarantees of specific results. Supplement effects vary based on individual physiology, activity levels, and adherence to a healthy lifestyle. By analyzing user responses, it becomes clear that LipoJaro is built more for reliability and balance than extreme fat loss. Those looking for a clean-label, stimulant-free addition to their routine may find it a helpful tool on the journey to better metabolic health. Your metabolism deserves better. LipoJaro supports sustainable fat loss—no harsh stimulants. Order today and save up to $780 instantly! Common Complaints and How They’re Handled Addressing the Concerns Behind the Feedback While many LipoJaro users report positive experiences, it’s important to acknowledge and evaluate the most common concerns shared by customers. A transparent supplement review doesn’t just highlight benefits—it also takes into account areas where users may have encountered friction or unmet expectations. Like any widely distributed wellness product, LipoJaro receives a range of feedback. Most complaints are not about the formulation itself but revolve around order fulfillment, expectations for rapid results, or communication with customer service. Understanding these concerns—and how the company addresses them—can help potential buyers make a more informed decision. Most Frequently Reported Complaints Disclaimer: Experiences vary by customer. For all support issues, it’s best to retain order confirmation emails and communicate directly with the official support team to ensure accurate service. How LipoJaro’s Brand Responds LipoJaro’s website features a clear returns policy and states a 60-day satisfaction guarantee. To back this, they provide a dedicated customer service email to handle refund requests, product inquiries, and shipping updates. While this policy is in place, like any supplement company, response times can fluctuate based on volume. The company also encourages buyers to use the product consistently for at least 30 days before judging its effectiveness—especially because it is not formulated with fast-acting synthetic stimulants that might mask true metabolic shifts. Transparent Business Practices Matter Although no product is universally loved, a brand’s willingness to address concerns head-on and stand by its refund policy reflects positively on its business model. Customers are encouraged to review all terms of service, usage instructions, and return guidelines before purchasing. Disclaimer: Always refer to the official website for the latest return policy, terms of use, and customer service contact information. Business policies are subject to change. Who Should Consider LipoJaro? Identifying the Ideal User Profile LipoJaro is designed for individuals seeking support in managing weight-related challenges using a non-stimulant, plant-based approach. While it is not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle, it may offer meaningful support for people who struggle with appetite control, cravings, and slow metabolism—especially those looking to avoid harsh ingredients or quick-fix gimmicks. Based on the ingredients and reported effects, LipoJaro may be a good fit for the following groups: Why the Stimulant-Free Approach Appeals to a Broader Audience Many people avoid traditional fat burners due to side effects such as anxiety, heart palpitations, or disrupted sleep. LipoJaro’snon-stimulant formula allows for daily use without triggering the nervous system or interfering with natural energy cycles. This makes it an attractive option for those seeking gentle, sustainable weight management rather than short-term energy spikes. Additionally, the inclusion of fiber-based ingredients like glucomannan and digestion-enhancing compounds such as black pepper extract can appeal to people dealing with bloating, irregularity, or sluggish digestion—factors that can all contribute to weight retention. Disclaimer: LipoJaro is not intended for individuals under 18, those with swallowing difficulties, or anyone diagnosed with a medical condition without physician approval. Always speak with a qualified healthcare provider before beginning any new dietary supplement. Who Might Not Benefit While LipoJaro is formulated to be accessible and well-tolerated, it may not suit everyone. Individuals expecting rapid fat loss, or those who are not committed to making lifestyle adjustments alongside supplement use, may not achieve optimal outcomes. Similarly, anyone requiring a medically supervised weight loss program should not use over-the-counter supplements without direct approval from a medical professional. Supporting the Right Expectations LipoJaro works best as a complement to balanced nutrition, hydration, and movement. It is not a magic bullet, but rather a support tool for those who are ready to improve consistency and reduce self-sabotaging habits like emotional eating or erratic hunger patterns. When used as directed, it may help users feel more in control of their eating, experience gradual improvements in body composition, and support their long-term weight wellness goals. Natural weight loss starts here—LipoJaro is trusted by thousands. Shop today for powerful appetite support with no side effects! How to Use LipoJaro for Maximum Benefit Following the Suggested Routine for Effective Results To get the most from any dietary supplement—especially one designed for non-stimulant metabolic support—consistency and proper timing matter. LipoJaro is formulated with ingredients like glucomannan, CLA, and green tea extract that work best when taken regularly and in conjunction with balanced lifestyle habits. According to the manufacturer, the recommended usage is to take two capsules per day, ideally 30 minutes before your two largest meals of the day, such as breakfast and lunch. This allows the ingredients to interact with food intake and support satiety before eating begins. Taking the capsules with at least 8 ounces of water is essential, particularly because glucomannan expands in the stomach to promote a sense of fullness. This hydration step is critical—not just for effectiveness, but for safety. Disclaimer: Never take LipoJaro dry or without sufficient water, as this could pose a choking hazard. Individuals with difficulty swallowing should not use this product. Tips for Integrating LipoJaro Into Your Daily Routine To optimize your experience with LipoJaro, consider the following best practices: What to Avoid While Taking LipoJaro Although LipoJaro is generally well-tolerated, it may be best to avoid pairing it with other fiber-heavy products or additional appetite suppressants without guidance from a healthcare provider. Overdoing fiber can lead to bloating or discomfort, especially if not spaced out properly. Additionally, combining LipoJaro with stimulant-based fat burners could be redundant and may offset its balanced, gentle effects. Disclaimer: Always read ingredient labels when combining supplements. If you are currently using other weight management products, consult a healthcare professional before adding LipoJaro to your routine. A Support Tool, Not a Standalone Solution LipoJaro works best when it's part of a bigger strategy that includes healthy meals, mindful eating, and light to moderate activity. While the supplement may help reduce calorie intake by encouraging smaller portion sizes and minimizing cravings, it is not intended to replace food, medication, or professional health guidance. When used with intention and discipline, LipoJaro may provide valuable support in staying on track, particularly for individuals prone to overeating or struggling with energy dips that derail consistent habits.

Science & Clinical Support The Research Behind LipoJaro’s Ingredient Strategy While LipoJaro as a branded supplement has not been subjected to its own clinical trials, several of its key ingredients are supported by independent studies and scientific literature that examine their potential roles in appetite control, fat metabolism, and digestive health. The formulation reflects a common evidence-informed strategy used in modern weight management supplements: targeting multiple metabolic pathways without relying on synthetic stimulants. Below is a breakdown of some of the research associated with LipoJaro’s core ingredients, including how they may function in the body to support weight wellness. Disclaimer: The following summary includes third-party research on individual ingredients. These studies do not imply guaranteed results from LipoJaro. Always consult with your healthcare provider before relying on supplements for clinical support. Glucomannan and Appetite Regulation Glucomannan is one of the most studied soluble fibers in the context of weight management. According to a 2005 study published in the International Journal of Obesity, participants who took glucomannan before meals showed greater reductions in body weight compared to a placebo group, primarily due to improved satiety and reduced calorie intake. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) and Fat Oxidation CLA has been examined for its possible impact on body composition. A meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reviewed 18 studies and found that CLA supplementation produced modest fat loss over time in overweight individuals. Green Tea Extract and Thermogenic Support Green tea extract—particularly its catechins like EGCG—has shown potential in increasing energy expenditure and supporting fat oxidation. A study in the Journal of Nutrition found that green tea extract enhanced fat burning during exercise. Garcinia Cambogia and Craving Control Garcinia cambogia contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which has been examined for its effects on appetite and serotonin levels. Some studies suggest it may reduce calorie intake by promoting a sensation of fullness. Chromium and Blood Sugar Support Chromium has been studied for its role in improving insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation. Maintaining stable blood sugar can influence hunger patterns and help reduce cravings for sweets or processed carbohydrates. BioPerine® (Black Pepper Extract) for Absorption BioPerine is frequently added to enhance the bioavailability of other nutrients, ensuring the body absorbs and utilizes ingredients more efficiently. This compound does not directly affect fat loss but may improve the overall efficacy of the supplement. LipoJaro’s ingredient profile reflects an alignment with clinical research, focusing on appetite control, energy utilization, and digestive health—all without harsh stimulants. Though more research is always needed on supplement synergy and long-term use, the product is formulated in a way that mirrors many successful strategies in modern wellness science.

Expert Opinions: What Health Professionals Say How Today’s Wellness Experts View LipoJaro’s Ingredient Strategy While LipoJaro has not been formally endorsed by a specific medical organization or clinical board, many of its individual ingredients reflect trends and strategies endorsed by integrative nutritionists and holistic health professionals. These experts often encourage a whole-body, stimulant-free approach to metabolic wellness—an approach that mirrors LipoJaro’s formulation. Given the increasing awareness of gut health, fiber intake, and blood sugar regulation in weight management, many professionals now emphasize the importance of dietary support that does not rely on chemical stimulants or extreme restriction. Supplements like LipoJaro that combine soluble fiber, thermogenic botanicals, and absorption-enhancing compounds offer a balanced alternative for individuals seeking gentle assistance in their health journey. Disclaimer: The opinions shared below reflect general statements from professionals on key ingredients used in LipoJaro. These are not direct endorsements of the product and should not replace individualized medical advice. Nutritionist Insight on Glucomannan Functional nutritionists often highlight glucomannan as a leading ingredient in natural appetite support. By expanding in the stomach and slowing digestion, it may help reduce overeating, especially when consumed with adequate water before meals. According to registered dietitians, soluble fiber like glucomannan plays a dual role: it supports satiety and improves digestive health. These benefits are particularly important for those who struggle with energy dips caused by blood sugar spikes after large meals. Professional Support for CLA and Green Tea Extract In the field of sports nutrition and weight management coaching, CLA and green tea extract are often used for individuals who need metabolic support without the overstimulation of caffeine-based products. These ingredients are praised for their ability to complement regular activity and healthy eating, not replace it. Practitioners point out that green tea catechins, in particular, may assist with mild thermogenesis and antioxidant defense, both of which are relevant for long-term wellness and recovery. Emphasis on Safe and Gentle Supplementation One key message echoed by many professionals is the importance of realistic expectations and personalization. Most experts agree that fat burners are not magic solutions—but when used with structure and discipline, a well-designed formula like LipoJaro may be a reasonable option for individuals needing support with consistency, especially in the areas of appetite control and daily routine management. They also value formulations that avoid harsh chemicals or artificial additives, which aligns with LipoJaro’s clean-label promise and manufacturing standards. As public understanding of metabolism, digestion, and long-term weight regulation continues to grow, more health professionals are embracing tools that gently support the body's natural systems rather than override them with temporary, high-intensity effects. LipoJaro fits this emerging philosophy by focusing on balance, sustainability, and ingredient integrity. LipoJaro vs Other Weight Loss Supplements How LipoJaro Stands Out in a Crowded Market With countless weight loss supplements competing for attention, it can be difficult for consumers to distinguish between products that offer real support and those built around marketing hype. LipoJaro differentiates itself by embracing a non-stimulant, clean-label approach that caters to individuals looking for sustainable weight management support without sacrificing long-term health. Unlike many traditional fat burners that rely heavily on caffeine or synthetic ingredients to trigger short-term effects like rapid energy bursts or dehydration-induced water loss, LipoJaro offers a plant-based formula that works gradually with the body to help regulate appetite, optimize digestion, and support fat metabolism. Comparison Factors to Consider 1. Formulation Strategy 2. Intended Use and User Sensitivity 3. Transparency and Clean Labeling 4. Customer-Centric Policies Disclaimer: All supplement comparisons are made based on available product information as of the time of writing. Individual product effectiveness and user satisfaction may vary. Always refer to official sources before making purchase decisions. Ideal for a Wellness-Focused Audience LipoJaro is better suited to consumers who value long-term health and are not seeking dramatic overnight transformations. It aligns with 2025 trends in personalized nutrition, gut health optimization, and non-stimulant metabolic support. Those who are already practicing mindful eating and incorporating regular movement may find it particularly helpful in curbing excess hunger and reinforcing dietary structure. By contrast, more aggressive fat burners may appeal to competitive athletes or short-term transformation seekers—but often at the expense of tolerability or holistic health.

Taken before meals with water, it expands in the stomach to help reduce calorie intake and cravings throughout the day. How do I take LipoJaro for best results? For optimal results, take two capsules daily—one before each of your two largest meals, ideally breakfast and lunch. Take the capsules with at least 8 ounces of water to activate the glucomannan fiber and promote satiety. Consistency is key, so daily use alongside balanced eating and movement is recommended. Can LipoJaro help me lose weight without diet or exercise? LipoJaro is intended to support healthy weight management when used as part of a comprehensive lifestyle plan. While some users may experience benefits like reduced appetite or fewer cravings, it is not a replacement for proper nutrition or physical activity.

Title: Adobe Premiere Pro vs. Apple Final Cut Pro: Which Video Editing App Should You Use?
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/video-editing/29704/adobe-premiere-pro-vs-apple-final-cut-pro-which-video-editing-app-should-you-use
Time Published: 2025-05-06T18:36:26Z
Full Content:
Apple's Final Cut Pro gives you a wealth of powerful video editing tools in a relatively simple interface, making it well worth the one-time price for professionals and serious hobbyists alike. VS Adobe Premiere Pro is an expansive, professional-level video editing program with top-notch editing tools, swift rendering speeds, useful collaboration features, and a well-designed interface. Adobe Premiere Pro requires a Creative Cloud subscription. You have three main options: an annual plan you pay up front ($263.88), an annual plan you pay monthly ($22.99 per month), or a month-to-month plan ($34.49 per month). Adobe also offers more affordable plans for students and pricier ones for businesses. If you want the entire Creative Cloud suite, which includes Audition, Photoshop, Illustrator, and a raft of other Adobe creative software, you need to pay $59.99 per month. The subscription model not only gets you program updates, which Adobe delivers semiannually, but also 100GB of cloud storage for syncing media. Any of these plans entitles you to activate the software on just two computers. A perpetual license for Final Cut Pro costs $299.99. It works out to be cheaper than Premiere Pro after just a year and a half, and you still get feature updates. Final Cut Pro is available from the Mac App Store, which eases the process of downloading updates and lets you install the program on multiple computers as long as you sign into the same Apple account. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro runs on both Windows and macOS. The online user guide states that it is the company's policy "to support the current and the most recent previous version of each operating system." For the moment, that means Windows 10 (64-bit) version 22H2 (or later) or Windows 11 with: On macOS, you need version 12 or later with: Premiere Pro runs on Apple silicon–based Macs natively. As you might expect, Final Cut Pro runs only on Macs. It requires macOS 14.6 or later, 8GB of RAM (it recommends 16GB), and a Metal-capable graphics card for Intel-based computers. For VR headset support, you also need SteamVR. Final Cut Pro runs smoothly on Apple silicon–based Macs as a native application. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro stays true to the tradition of high-end, professional-level software. Ease of use and simplicity of interface are not paramount among its goals. That said, there's no reason that a determined amateur with time to devote to learning the software couldn’t use it. Adobe has other products more appropriate for hobbyists, including Premiere Elements. Apple makes the upgrade path from its consumer-level video editor, iMovie, very smooth. The latest version of Final Cut on the desktop also makes it easy to import projects you started on an iPhone or iPad. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro uses a traditional nonlinear editor (NLE) timeline with tracks and track heads. It calls your timeline content a sequence, and you can create nested sequences, subsequences, and subclips to keep everything organized. The timeline has tabs for multiple sequences, which can be helpful if you're working with nested sequences. Longtime video editors are likely more comfortable with this setup than with Apple's more inventive trackless Magnetic Timeline. Adobe's system also fits with some pro workflows in which the tracks are in an expected arrangement. It works differently from consumer video editing apps, however, because it automatically separates a clip's audio track from its video. The timeline is very scalable and offers the usual razor, ripple, roll, slip, and slide tools. The interface is extremely configurable, letting you undock any and all panels. You can show or hide FX badges, keyframes, thumbnails, and waveforms. You get seven preconfigured workspaces (including Assembly, Editing, Color, and Titles) compared with Final Cut's mere three. Apple's innovative trackless Magnetic Timeline is easier on the eyes than the traditional timeline interface, and it offers several editing advantages, such as connected Auditions, clips, and roles (descriptive labels such as Dialog, Effects, Music, Titles, and Video). Auditions let you designate optional clips or takes for a spot in your movie, and you can group clips into compound clips—roughly the equivalent of Premiere's Nested Sequences. Instead of tracks, Final Cut Pro uses lanes, with a primary storyline that everything else attaches to. This makes keeping everything in sync easier than in Premiere. Final Cut Pro's interface is less configurable than Premiere's. You can't split panels off into windows, except for the Preview window, which is very spare in the control department—the only options are Play and Pause. Premiere offers a lot more here, with buttons for Export Frame, Extract, Go to In, Go to Previous Edit Point, Lift, and Step Back. As mentioned, Final Cut offers just three prebuilt workspaces (Color & Effects, Default, and Organize). Winner: Tie Like a traditional NLE, Premiere Pro lets you store related media in bins, which are similar to folders. As with folders, you can have bins within bins. You can also apply color labels to assets, but not keyword tags. The Libraries panel lets you share assets among other Adobe applications, such as After Effects and Photoshop. Apple's program organizes your media through events, keyword tagging, libraries, and roles. The library is the overarching container that includes your projects, events, and clips, and it keeps track of all your edits and options. You can also manage storage targets and perform batch clip renaming. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro works with pretty much any media format of any level of professionalism, as well as media type for which you installed codecs on your computer. That even includes Apple ProRes. The software supports working with native (raw) camera formats, including those for ARRI, Canon, Panasonic, RED, and Sony. There's not much video you can create or import that Premiere can't handle. It even supports XML documents you export from Final Cut Pro.Final Cut Pro works with the HEVC codec that many 4K video cameras and Apple's iPhones use. Like Premiere Pro, Final Cut supports native formats from all the major video camera makers, including ARRI, Canon, Panasonic, RED, and Sony, as well as many video-capable still cameras. It, too, handles XML file imports and exports.Winner: Tie After Effects, Premiere's stablemate in the Creative Cloud ecosystem, is the industry-standard motion graphics tool. It dovetails smoothly with Premiere Pro but is more difficult to master than Apple Motion, which now has many of the same capabilities. Regardless, After Effects is the tool to learn if you want to pursue professional video editing as a career. The app costs $263.88 per year. Apple Motion is also a powerful tool for creating effects, titles, and transitions. It supports custom templates, logical layers, and a rich plug-in ecosystem. Motion is probably a better fit if you use Final Cut Pro as your primary editor. Even if you don't, it's just a one-time, $49.99 purchase.Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro The latest generative AI feature to land in Adobe's video software is Generative Extend, which creates extra video frames (including 4K) from the surrounding content for cases in which a clip isn't quite long enough to fit the rest of your timeline. Other Premiere Pro features include AI speech-to-text with automatic translation, color management that recognizes raw and log footage and automatically color-corrects it, and Media Intelligence, which recognizes clip contents to help you find them. Apple's pro video editor is playing catch-up with Premiere Pro. It now includes auto-captioning from speech in videos, but still lacks both text-based editing and video generation capabilities. It does, however, integrate with macOS's Image Playground to generate cartoon-like still images, for what that's worth. Magnetic Mask (apply effects just to fine-tuned masked areas) and Scene Removal round out some of the other recent AI tools in the app. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro includes the Lumetri Color tools. These are pro-level color grading features that were formerly part of the standalone SpeedGrade application. The Lumetri tools support 3D lookup tables (LUTs) for powerful and customizable looks. The tools offer a remarkable amount of color manipulation, along with a great selection of film and HDR looks. You can adjust black point, contrast, exposure, highlights, shadows, and white balance—all of which you can activate with keyframes. Faded Film, Saturation, Sharpen, and Vibrance adjustment presets are also available. Most impressive are the Color Wheel and Curves options. The Lumetri Scope view is also especially cool; it shows the current frame's proportional use of red, green, and blue. As mentioned, Premiere Pro includes a dedicated workspace for color editing. To compete with Adobe's impressive Lumetri Color tools, Final Cut has a Color Wheel tool that's impressive in its own right. Color Wheels show a puck in the middle that lets you move an image toward green, blue, or red; the result appears to the side of the wheel. You can also adjust brightness and saturation with the wheels, separately control everything (with the Master wheel), or adjust just shadows, midtones, or highlights. It's a remarkably powerful and intuitive set of tools. If wheels are not to your taste, the Color Board option shows a simple linear view of your color settings. The Color Curves tool lets you use multiple control points to adjust each of the three primary colors for very specific points on the brightness scale. Luma, RGB Parade, and Vectorscope monitors give you incredible insight into your movie's color usage. You can even edit a single color value using a dropper. Final Cut now supports color LUTs from camera manufacturers such as ARRI, Canon, Red, and Sony, as well as custom LUTs for effects. You can combine these effects with others in a stacked arrangement. Color scopes adapt to HDR editing, as do the color editing tools. Supported formats include Rec. 2020 HLG and Rec. 2020 PQ for HDR10 output.Winner: Tie Premiere offers Photoshop-like control over title text formatting, with a vast number of adjustments and fonts such as kerning, leading, rotation, shadow, stroking, and tracking, just to name a few. But for 3D manipulation, you need to head to After Effects. For captions, Premiere Pro is a hard act to follow: It not only creates captions from spoken words in your video, but, as mentioned, it also lets you edit based on the captions. As a result, you can take out ums and uhs in the video simply by removing the text from the caption. Premiere can then automatically translate the captions into 27 international languages and display multiple language tracks at once. Final Cut Pro includes strong 3D title editing with keyframe motion options. You get lots of control over title overlays, with dozens of animation templates. You edit text and position and size the titles right in the video preview; there's no need for an external title editor. Final Cut Pro's 3D Titles offer eight basic templates and four more cinematic ones, including a cool 3D Earth choice for sci-fi projects. There are 20 font presets, but you can use any style and size you like. Materials such as concrete, fabric, and plastic give your titles any texture you desire. You also get a bunch of lighting options. For maximum control, you can edit the 3D titles in Motion. Extrude 2D titles into 3D by tapping the 3D Text option in the Text Inspector, and you can then position and rotate the text to taste on three axes. Apple's software can now automatically transcribe spoken words in clips to text captions, but Premiere Pro goes way beyond that, identifying separate speakers, translating, and allowing text-based timeline editing. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro lets you play 360-degree VR footage and change the field of view and angle. You can watch this content in anaglyphic form, which is a fancy way of saying you can see it in 3D using standard red-and-blue glasses. You can also have your video track a head-mounted display's view. You can't use Premiere Pro (or Final Cut Pro) to edit 360-degree footage unless you stitch it into equirectangular format. Corel VideoStudio, CyberLink PowerDirector, and Pinnacle Studio can all open 360-degree footage without this conversion. You can't see the spherical view alongside the flattened view in Premiere like in those apps, but you can easily toggle between them if you add the VR button to the preview window. Helpfully, Premiere lets you tag a video as VR so that Facebook or YouTube can tell it's 360-degree content. Apple's pro video editor now has better 360-degree features, including support for Apple's VisionPro and the HTC Vive (sorry Meta Quest users). It offers 360-degree titles, some effects, and a nifty Patch tool that removes the camera and tripod from your movie. With the standalone Compressor app ($49.99), you can share 360-degree video directly to Facebook, Vimeo, and YouTube. You also get stabilization for 360-degree video. Winner: Tie Premiere Pro's Audio Mixer shows balance, mute/solo, clipping indicator, pan, volume unit (VU) meter controls for all timeline tracks. You can use it to make adjustments as the project plays. The app automatically creates new tracks when you drop an audio clip in the timeline, and you can specify types, such as 5.1, adaptive, mono, standard (which can contain a combination of mono and stereo files), and stereo. Double-clicking the VU meters or panning dials returns their levels to zero. The audio meters next to Premiere's timeline are resizable and let you solo any track. The program also supports hardware controllers and third-party VSP plug-ins. If you have Adobe Audition, you can round-trip your audio between that and Premiere Pro for advanced techniques such as adaptive noise reduction, automatic click removal, compression, parametric EQ, and studio reverb. Audio editing is a strength of Final Cut Pro. It can automatically fix hum, noise, and peaks, or you can manually take care of these problems. Over 1,300 royalty-free sound effects are available, as are a long list of plug-ins. One impressive trick is the ability to match separately recorded tracks. For example, if you shoot HD footage with a DSLR and record sound simultaneously on another recorder, the Match Audio feature aligns the sound source (Premiere Pro has a similar feature). Support for Apple Logic Pro plug-ins gives you even more powerful sound editing options. Finally, you get a surround-sound mixer to animate or locate 5.1 audio, as well as either a 10- or 31-band equalizer.Winner: Tie Premiere Pro offers more export formats than you are ever likely to need. You get even more options via the Media Encoder app, which can target Blu-ray, DVD, Facebook, Twitter, or Vimeo formats. Encoder lets you batch encode to target multiple devices in a single job, such as mobile phones, iPads, and HDTVs. Premiere can also output media using H.265 and the Rec. 2020 color space. Adobe's updated Export interface mode makes the process simpler yet more powerful; it lets you choose multiple social targets. Final Cut Pro's output options are comparatively limited unless you add the companion application, Apple Compressor. The base app can, however, export to XML and produce HDR, wide-color-space output including Rec. 2020 Hybrid Log Gamma and Rec. 2020 HDR10. Compressor adds the ability to customize output settings and perform batch output jobs. It also adds support for Blu-ray and DVD menus and chapter themes. You can even package movies in the format necessary for iTunes. Winner: Tie Like most modern video editors, Premiere Pro uses proxy views of your video content to speed up apparent performance, and I didn't encounter any lag while testing normal editing operations. The software takes advantage of graphics CUDA and OpenCL hardware acceleration and multicore CPUs with its Adobe Mercury Playback Engine. Premiere Pro locks the app during exporting by default, though you can get around this behavior by choosing Queue in the Export dialog via the Media Encoder app. One of the primary goals of Final Cut Pro is to take advantage of 64-bit processing and the newer Apple silicon chips. Conveniently, exporting in Final Cut happens in the background, so you can continue working in the program. I test export time by creating a 5-minute movie consisting of four clips of mixed types with a standard set of transitions. My test media files include some 8K and more 4K source clips. I render it to H.264 1080p, 60fps, using H.264 High Profile. The audio is AAC 192Kbps. For testing, I use a MacBook Air with an M1 processor and 8GB of RAM running macOS Sequoia. It's on the low end of power for video editing, so it shows differences more distinctly than more expensive hardware. Premiere Pro easily bested Final Cut Pro. The former completed the task in 170 seconds, while the latter required 205 seconds. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe maintains a large ecosystem of creative apps and services to support Premiere Pro. Aside from the Creative Cloud apps that work smoothly with Premiere, including After Effects, Audition, and Photoshop, Adobe offers the Premiere Rush mobile app, from which you can import projects. Adobe Express and Firefly, both of which you get with a Premiere subscription, include powerful AI video generation capabilities. Another app, Adobe Capture, lets you snap images for use as colors, shapes, and textures in Premiere Pro. Adobe's support for Frame.io collaboration and cloud storage is important for professional use. Other lesser-known Creative Cloud apps include Adobe Character Animator, a nifty app that produces animations based on live actors' faces and body movements, and Animate, which does the same for illustrations. You can bring both types of projects into Premiere Pro. Finally, the Adobe Stock integration comes in handy for those times you need B-roll or other stock media. Unfortunately, Stock is not part of a Premiere Pro subscription; plans start at $29.99 per month. It's a snap to import projects from iMovie on an iPhone or iPad into the pro editor, as mentioned. And that goes for the newer Final Cut Camera app, available on iPhone and iPad. The Final Cut iPad app ($4.99 per month) allows multicam shooting, as does the Camera app. The already-mentioned Motion and Compressor sibling applications, along with Apple's high-end sound editor, Logic Pro, extend the program's capabilities, but that collection of apps can't compete with Premiere Pro's. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro PC hardware is nice, but it’s not much use without innovative software. I’ve been reviewing software for PCMag since 2008, and I still get a kick out of seeing what's new in video and photo editing software, and how operating systems change over time.

Title: Best Dividend Stocks for Steady Passive Income

If you want your money to work for you, dividend stocks are one of the smartest ways to build steady passive income over time. Many investors, from beginners to retirees, rely on dividends to supplement their income without having to sell their shares. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about the best dividend stocks, how to choose them, and which ones to consider adding to your portfolio in 2025. Contents Dividend stocks are shares of companies that regularly return a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. These payments are typically made quarterly, though some companies pay monthly or annually. Unlike growth stocks that reinvest most of their earnings to expand the business, dividend-paying companies are usually more established and focus on rewarding shareholders. Key Features of Dividend Stocks: Dividend investing is popular for many reasons: When searching for the best dividend stocks, you need to look beyond just the dividend yield. Here are some key metrics: This is the annual dividend per share divided by the stock’s current price. A higher yield means more income, but extremely high yields can be a red flag. This measures how much of a company’s earnings are paid out in dividends. A lower payout ratio is generally better, suggesting the company has room to grow or weather downturns. Look for companies that consistently increase their dividends year after year. This shows financial strength and shareholder commitment. Stable earnings mean the company can maintain or grow its dividend even in tough economic times. This is the cash left after operational expenses and capital expenditures. It’s a more accurate indicator of dividend sustainability. These are well-established companies with reliable dividends and strong financials. Think Procter & Gamble or Johnson & Johnson. Companies that have increased dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Firms with 50+ years of consecutive dividend increases. These are required to pay out 90% of their income as dividends. Examples include Realty Income and American Tower. Stable and regulated businesses that provide consistent dividends. Now let’s dive into some of the best dividend stocks to consider for steady passive income. If you’re more risk-tolerant and looking for higher income, consider these: Spread your investments across different industries to reduce risk. Use DRIP plans to compound your returns over time. Hold dividend stocks in Roth IRAs or tax-deferred accounts to avoid unnecessary taxes. Don’t just chase high yields—balance them with companies that offer stability and growth. Keep an eye on earnings reports, dividend announcements, and economic conditions. If picking individual stocks feels overwhelming, dividend ETFs are a great alternative. Even strong companies can reduce or eliminate dividends during tough times. Stock prices can fluctuate, even if the dividend remains steady. If dividend growth doesn’t keep up with inflation, purchasing power may decline. Rising interest rates can hurt utility and REIT stocks. Investing in the best dividend stocks can be a game-changer for anyone looking to earn steady, passive income. With a little research, patience, and diversification, you can build a dividend portfolio that supports your financial goals now and in the future. Whether you’re saving for retirement, supplementing your income, or just want your money to work smarter, dividend stocks offer a reliable path to financial independence.

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. While the U.S. added more jobs than expected last month, other labor market indicators are not so ... More optimistic. As part of my job, I spend quite a bit of time each week speaking with job-seekers and perusing job boards to see who is hiring and for what positions. In the last month, one thing has been—at least anecdotally—clear: More job postings are popping up. Friday’s job numbers confirmed this trend. The U.S. added 177,000 new jobs in April, higher than analysts’ expectations, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Wages also rose 3.8% year-over-year to a record average of $36.06 an hour for nonfarm employees. But economists are warning against too much optimism from Friday’s report. For one, the private sector added only 62,000 jobs in April, less than half of what analysts expected as employers held tight in the face of the expected impact from tariffs, marking the slowest job growth in the sector since July 2024. “Unease is the word of the day,” Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP said in the company’s national employment report. Then there are the layoff numbers. While unemployment remained flat at 4.2%, layoffs increased by 63% compared to last April, though they decreased month-over-month. DOGE-related cuts accounted for almost half of all layoffs, either by directly cutting government positions or by the downstream effects of such cuts. And increased hiring numbers could be a result of companies’ front-ending against tariff and macroeconomic impacts, preparing themselves for tougher times. Still, President Trump was optimistic, celebrating “strong employment” numbers. We’ll be keeping our eyes out to see how things shake up, especially as the class of 2025 joins the market. Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter. When the roles are flipped, how should you deliver bad news to your boss? In the world of hypercommunication, here is how to make sure you’re communicating effectively. An increasing number of workers are taking microretirements to prevent burnout. Watch out for these signs that you could be the first cut in a layoff. News from the world of work. AI startups are increasingly requiring their employees to work six or seven days a week, Forbes’ Richard Nieva reports. While hustle culture has always been glorified in Silicon Valley, this could be the first time companies are brazen enough to advertise the long-hour expectations. The Philippines is the latest country to offer a digital nomad visa for remote workers. The requirements are quite standard, including proving you are able to generate sufficient income outside the country. Feeling understaffed? It’s not just your company. The Wall Street Journal found that while corporate America isn’t massively laying off workers, many have paused hiring and are leaving more jobs unfilled. Turns out laying off employees and replacing them with AI is not as easy—or effective—as it looks. A new survey found that 55% of leaders who let go of workers as a direct result of deploying more AI functions admit they made the wrong decision. Under President Trump, the IRS has shed more than 11% of its workforce, and more cuts are on the way, Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb reports. Layoffs at the agency have impacted workers across the country, including Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, with tax auditors being the hardest hit.

Title: Trump says pharmaceutical tariffs are coming. Here's what to expect
URL: https://qz.com/trump-tariffs-pharma-companies-astrazeneca-gsk-1851779389
Time Published: 2025-05-06T17:53:00Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are headed to the medicine aisle next. On Monday, Trump announced his plans to place tariffs on pharmaceutical imports “within the next two weeks,” signing an executive order designed to boost drug companies’ manufacturing in the U.S. While the exact tariff rates haven’t yet been specified, the president has suggested they could be as high as 200%. “We don’t want to be buying our pharmaceuticals from other countries because if we’re in a war, we’re in a problem, we want to be able to make our own,” Trump said in a fact sheet. “As we invest in the future, we will permanently bring our medical supply chains back home. We will produce our medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and treatments right here in the United States.” The president’s executive order gives U.S. agencies a clear message: Move faster. Trump has directed the FDA to speed up approvals for domestic manufacturing facilities while promising more surprise inspections of overseas plants and raising inspection fees for foreign drugmakers. Meanwhile, the EPA is being told to fast-track construction permits for pharmaceutical facilities. The White House has estimated that it can take five to 10 years to build manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals, which it says is “unacceptable from a national security standpoint.” The Commerce Department launched a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports in April, paving the way for these tariffs. That’s the same provision the Trump administration previously used to justify sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018. “Pharma companies are going to come roaring back, they’re coming roaring back, they’re all coming back to our country, because if they don’t, they got a big tax to pay,” Trump said in his original “Liberation Day” tariff announcement on April 2. But the president’s move to promote U.S. manufacturing by placing tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry could backfire. Pharmaceutical companies are already navigating tight margins and global competition. Broad tariffs on imported drugs could lead to higher prices for patients and supply disruptions in a system that’s already under strain. Drug companies had previously enjoyed favorable trade terms, particularly under a 1994 World Trade Organization agreement that set low or zero tariffs on finished products and key active ingredients. In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $200 billion of pharmaceutical products — and about 73% came from European countries that have long served as manufacturing hubs for the industry. Ireland, Germany and Switzerland were the top three jurisdictions for U.S. pharmaceutical imports, according to consulting firm PwC. And many of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in medicines that are sold in the U.S. are made abroad, particularly in India and China. The tariffs’ implications could be significant for companies based in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The U.K. exported $8.1 billion in pharmaceuticals (one of the sovereign state’s top imports) to the U.S. in 2023, with around $4.1 billion originating from U.K.-based production. Global giants GSK (GSK+1.80%) and AstraZeneca (AZN+0.03%) are both based in the U.K., making them vulnerable to any proposed import taxes. Both companies plan to lobby hard to shield the sector from such tariffs, joining a group that successfully secured temporary exemptions for pharmaceuticals from a 10% baseline tariff that Trump previously levied on many other foreign goods. But with the president’s tariff announcement looming, the pressure is on for these companies to either relocate manufacturing to the U.S. or risk facing a hefty price tag. A 2023 analysis conducted by Ernst & Young found that a 25% tariff on pharmaceutical imports could lead to an increase of up to $51 billion a year in drug costs, potentially raising prices for consumers by as much as 12.9%. Giovanni Barbella, the global head of strategy and supply chain at the Swiss generic drugmaker Sandoz (NVS-0.56%), told The Guardian that tariffs would lead to supply disruptions and price increases, hitting U.S. patients hardest. “We are producing products on a very tight margin,” Barbella said. “That’s the nature of our industry. So ultimately, higher production cost, including the cost of tariffs, will lead to higher prices.” The Association for Accessible Medicines warned in February that tariffs could strain cash-strapped generic drugmakers and distributors, potentially leading to increased costs for patients and disruptions in the supply chain. “There can be even more supply disruption, because some players can leave the [U.S.] market and focus on markets where they can make more business,” Barbella added. “So ultimately, the risk is that the U.S. patient will suffer the most.” The U.S. is already battling a record number of drug shortages, from cancer medications to antibiotics. Nearly 270 drugs were on the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists’ official list of active drug shortages as of early 2025. Many of these shortages stem from global supply chain issues, including reliance on single-source manufacturers overseas. Tariffs could worsen the situation by discouraging imports or driving up costs to unsustainable levels. For patients, this could mean delayed treatments or forced switches to less effective alternatives. And for hospitals and insurers, it could translate to higher costs and more administrative headaches. Mark Samuels, the CEO of Medicines UK, which represents Britain-based generic drugmakers, told The Guardian that, “in an insurance-based system as the U.S. has, if medicine costs increase and insurance runs out, then that does increase the risk that people either can’t afford to complete their cancer treatments or pay for it altogether.” Those comments — and the substantial risks rising drug costs pose — were echoed by Gareth Sheridan, the CEO of the Irish-founded pharmaceutical company Nutriband. “These types of treatments can’t afford a disruption in the global supply chain,” Sheridan told the BBC. “As a comparable situation: tariffs on automobiles. You can’t afford a BMW? Buy a Ford and you can still get to work. If you have a 25% hike on chemotherapy and you can’t afford your treatment any more, what’s the alternative? I mean, ultimately, people are going to die.” Some major pharmaceutical companies are already trying to adapt, announcing major investments in U.S.-based manufacturing. To insulate themselves from any potential tariffs, Swiss pharma giants Roche (RHHBY-0.05%) and Novartis are committing $50 billion and $23 billion, respectively, to U.S. investments over the coming years. In November, AstraZeneca announced a $3.5 billion investment and recently confirmed it will shift production of certain U.S.-bound drugs from Europe to the U.S. Meanwhile, U.S.-based Eli Lilly (LLY+0.74%), the producer of diabetes and weight-loss medications Mounjaro and Zepbound, is allocating at least $27 billion to build four new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-0.53%) plans to invest $55 billion in U.S. manufacturing and research over the next four years. The company, which has its headquarters in New Jersey, could be especially affected by any new U.S. tariffs due to its extensive production footprint across Europe, including operations in the U.K., Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, and Belgium. But even with these moves, shifting production on a large scale is neither quick nor easy. Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s (PFE+1.72%) CEO, said on the company’s first-quarter earnings call that the New York-based firm could undertake “tremendous investments” in the U.S. if there were clearer trade policies and if tariff threats were removed. The company’s chief financial officer, Dave Denton, said that the already existing tariffs are expected to cost the company around $150 million in 2025. And analysts say that’s a real risk: If costs go up and regulatory uncertainty grows, drugmakers may delay projects or pass costs onto consumers. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%), the Danish company behind blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, could also feel the squeeze. While it has a growing U.S. presence — including a major site in North Carolina and more than 10,000 U.S.-based employees — it imports some finished products and components from Europe. Still, Novo Nodisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in an interview with Bloomberg TV that the company’s operations in the U.S. would be sufficient “to a large degree. ... The base case is that this is something we can handle.” Trump has yet to formally specify a rate for these pharmaceutical tariffs. The full consequences of the administration’s policy will unfold as pharmaceutical companies adjust their strategies in the coming months. With significant stakes at play for both the U.S. economy and global health systems, it remains to be seen how the president’s approach will ultimately shake out. For now, drugmakers and consumers alike must prepare for what could be a bumpy road ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Vornado Realty Trust Earnings Beat Estimates in Q1

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Vornado Realty Trust posted better-than-expected earnings results for the first quarter of 2025, and provided more details on its massive 70-year lease with New York University (NYU), sending its stock higher by more than 3 percent on Tuesday afternoon. The real estate giant reported quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $126.2 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, above the 55 cents per diluted share reported for the same period last year and topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents per share. Net income for the first quarter was $86.8 million, or 43 cents per diluted share, above the net loss of 5 cents per diluted share for the first quarter of 2024. Revenue was $461.5 million for 2025’s first quarter, exceeding the $436.3 million reported for last year’s first quarter. It also beat the Zacks estimate by 3 percent. Vornado attributed its strong quarterly performance to the $350 million sale of a portion of Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo’s flagship store at 666 Fifth Avenue in Midtown, the ground rent at its Penn 1 building being set nearly $11 million lower than Vornado expected — although at a price which is still under litigation — and strong leasing activity in Manhattan. “Manhattan continues to be the best real estate market in the country, especially so for office, but also for apartments and retail,” Steven Roth, CEO of Vornado, said on the company’s earnings call. “In the 180 million-square-foot Class A better building market in which we compete, demand continues to be robust.” On Monday, Vornado announced the completion of the 1.1 million-square-foot, 70-year master lease at 770 Broadway with NYU, which it first mentioned in November. The university made a prepaid lease payment of $935 million to Vornado and will make annual lease payments of $9.3 million for the entire life of the lease, Vornado said. Vornado was facing a hole in the property after Facebook parent Meta said it would drop 275,000 square feet once its lease expired, but NYU swooped in to take over the entire building. “We use a portion of the prepaid rent payment to repay the $700 million mortgage loan, which previously encumbered the property, and $200 million to increase our cash balances,” Roth said on the call. “Though, this transaction is a lease … it is treated as a sale.” Vornado had an active quarter of leasing activity across the retail and office space for the 2025 first quarter. The company leased 1.04 million square feet across its portfolio — 709,000 square feet of that in New York City — and commanded starting rents of $95 per square foot, Roth said. That includes the 337,000 square feet Universal Music signed at Penn 2. At the start of the earnings call, Roth acknowledged that the current macroeconomic environment is very different from its fourth-quarter earnings call in February. Still, despite political and economic uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Roth has a positive outlook going forward, saying tariffs could “make a big dent in getting our federal budget deficit under control.” “Notwithstanding the tactics, reducing government bloat has to be a good thing,” Roth said. “I am agnostic, whatever the outcome. I believe that this global kerfuffle will be resolved more quickly than you think.” Amanda Schiavo can be reached at aschiavo@commercialobserver.com.

Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) CEO Jensen Huang said AI has revived a dying San Francisco that many thought wouldn’t recover from the pandemic. “It’s because of AI that San Francisco is back,” Huang said while speaking to Jacob Helberg, Trump’s undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, at The Hill & Valley Forum. “Anybody who lives in San Francisco, you’ll know what I’m talking about. Just about everybody evacuated San Francisco,” he said, “Now it’s thriving again. It’s all because of AI.” A 2024 article from The San Francisco Standard called AI companies San Francisco’s “most desired tenants.” It cited a JLL (JLL-1.68%) report that found AI companies leased north of 1.7 million square feet of office space since 2022, when ChatGPT was released. Chris Pham, senior analyst at JLL, predicted a continued AI boom in the city, likening it to the invention of electricity, instead of just another new industry. In his remarks with Helberg, Huang acknowledged that as AI progresses, “new jobs will be created, some jobs will be lost, and every job will be changed.” “It’s not AI that’s going to take your job. It’s not AI that’s going to destroy your company,” he said, encouraging widespread adoption of the technology. “It’s the company and the person who uses AI that’s going to take your job. And so that’s something to internalize.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

May 06, 2025 12:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, May 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The U.S. kids beverage market is projected was valued at US$ 18.84 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 30.24 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 5.53% during the forecast period 2025–2033. The United States kids beverage market has spent the past thirty-six months in a trial-and-error cycle that is rapidly reshaping category leadership. IRI panel data for 2024 show that 61% of households with children bought at least one “limited-time” flavor over the last year, up from 38% in 2021. Brands that capitalized early—Capri Sun with Strawberry Kiwi Splash, Gatorade Zero Kids with Glacier Freeze, and Honest Kids with Super Fruit Punch—saw unit velocities climb 9–14% even as shelf facings remained flat. Fruit blends now account for 42% of all juice-box UPCs, overtaking single-flavor apple offerings for the first time since records were kept. Within enhanced waters, blue raspberry and cotton-candy variants—once regarded as novelty items—have crossed the 5% share threshold, a milestone usually associated with sustained repeat purchases. Download Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/united-states-kids-beverages-market Flavor churn is, however, only half the story; manufacturers are leveraging real-time social listening to identify micro-trends before they hit mainstream retail in the kids beverage market. PepsiCo’s Stingray dashboard, for example, flags elementary-school lunchbox mentions on TikTok every four hours, feeding that intel to R&D teams that can turn around pilot batches in under ten weeks. The payoff is visible: “Dragonfruit Burst” appeared in Walmart end-caps nationwide just 94 days after first trending online. At the same time, legacy players are pruning underperforming classics—Orange Tang was delisted by two major grocers in Q3-2023—to make room for Gen-Alpha-friendly mashups like mango-peach and watermelon-lime. Stakeholders should therefore view flavor leadership not as a static mantle but as a rolling sprint governed by data-backed agility and nimble co-packer partnerships. Key Findings in United States Kids Beverage Market Functional hydration products reshape wellness narratives for school-aged consumers today in the Kids Beverage Market Wellness claims have become table stakes, but functional hydration adds a science-backed edge that resonates with parents scanning ingredient lists. The 2024 Kids’ Beverage Attributes Survey from SPINS reveals that 47% of U.S. guardians now look for electrolytes, B-vitamins, or prebiotics when purchasing drinks for children aged six to twelve. Propelled by this interest, brands such as Prime Hydration Kids, BODYARMOR Flash I.V., and Pedialyte Sport Junior grew combined unit sales by 28% year over year. Notably, products with 100 mg or less sodium per serving doubled their shelf presence, underscoring a “clean-label electrolyte” narrative that appeals to pediatricians and school administrators striving to curb excess salt. Energy modulation is the second pillar driving functional launches in the United States kids beverage market. Caffeine remains off-limits for under-13s, so formulators are leaning on L-theanine, magnesium, and plant-derived adaptogens to support focus without jitters. DSM-Firmenich reports a 300% surge in requests for water-stable L-theanine emulsions suitable for 6-ounce pouches. Meanwhile, Nestlé’s Boost Kids Essentials fortified drink introduced 4 g of prebiotic fiber to address digestive health, and early ACV scanner data indicate a 12% repeat-purchase rate within eight weeks—an impressive signal for a premium-priced SKU. Parents, buoyed by pediatric health-influencer endorsements on Instagram, appear willing to pay a 35 ¢ per-unit premium if the beverage promises immunity or cognitive benefits validated by peer-reviewed studies. Decision makers should therefore embed clinical substantiation into marketing narratives and consider partnering with children’s hospitals for longitudinal trials, as evidence-based storytelling is rapidly becoming the currency of consumer trust in this evolving segment. Plant-based and dairy-alternative beverages gain traction among allergic children nationwide Food-allergy prevalence among U.S. minors now stands at 8%, according to the CDC’s 2024 summary, fueling demand for plant-based drinks that circumvent common allergens. Soy once dominated the conversation in the kids beverage market, yet Oatly’s 2023 nationwide placement of single-serve oat-milk cartons sparked a 92% velocity increase across K-5 cafeterias operated by Chartwells Schools. Almond and coconut lines remain niche in elementary settings due to tree-nut concerns, but pea-protein formulas—Ripple Kids, for example—have captured a 19% share within the shelf-stable “milk substitutes” aisle. Nutrient density, especially a 50-% higher calcium content versus skim dairy, is a key purchase driver cited by 63% of surveyed parents. Beyond nutritional parity, sustainability messaging bolsters category legitimacy in the kids beverage market. Life-cycle-assessment firm HowGood notes that oat-milk boxes yield 45% lower greenhouse-gas emissions than equivalent UHT cow’s-milk cartons—data now called out via QR codes on pack fronts. Retailers are responding: Kroger expanded its “Plant-Powered Kids” set from eight to twenty-four facings in 2024, while Target’s Good & Gather launched an organic chickpea-milk line at $3.99 per four-pack. Flavor remains critical; chocolate leads, but strawberry oat-milk earned an impressive 4.8-star rating on the Walmart Marketplace within three weeks of debut. As brands explore sunflower-seed bases and fermented rice options, clear allergen statements and school-compliance certification will determine acceptance, underscoring the necessity for rigorous cross-contact controls and transparent labeling strategies. Sugar reduction strategies influence consumer behavior and parental purchase criteria With pediatric obesity rates touching 19.7% in 2023 (CDC), the United States kids beverage market faces relentless scrutiny over added sugars. The FDA’s updated voluntary guidance encourages manufacturers to limit kids’ drinks to 6 g of total sugar per 8 oz serving, down from 10 g previously. Consequently, 72% of new UPCs launched in 2024 utilize high-intensity sweetener blends—stevia-allulose or monk-fruit-erythritol—to achieve a 35–50% caloric cut. Kraft Heinz’s Capri Sun Reformulation 3.0 removed 2.5 billion grams of sugar from U.S. circulation between 2020 and 2024, a stat widely cited in retailer sustainability scorecards. Consumer sentiment validates the shift in the kids beverage market: an Ipsos poll of 1,500 U.S. parents found that 58% are willing to switch brands if sugar grams exceed classroom guidelines, even when price parity does not exist. However, taste remains uncompromised territory; 41% of children aged eight to ten reported “off” aftertaste with first-generation stevia drinks, pushing brands toward next-gen Reb-M and fermented sweeteners that mimic sucrose perception curves. Shelf tags now carry traffic-light icons—green for <5 g, yellow for 5–7 g—implemented by Albertsons in 327 stores, nudging parents at point of sale. Looking forward, tooth-friendly certifications from the American Dental Association and on-pack glycemic-index scores could become differentiators, suggesting that cross-functional R&D teams must synchronize sensory science, regulatory affairs, and marketing to safeguard repeat purchase in an increasingly sugar-averse retail environment. Value-based pricing tiers evolve alongside private label and premium launches Inflationary pressure hit family grocery budgets hard in the kids beverage market, yet the kids beverage category proved resilient by stretching across multiple price ladders. NielsenIQ 52-week data to March 2024 show that unit volumes in the sub-$3 six-pack tier rose 5%, led by Walmart’s Great Value Fruit Punch and Dollar General’s Clover Valley Juice Drinks. Conversely, $1.99 “better-for-you” single-serve bottles—think GoodSport Kids Electrolyte Water—registered a 17% upswing, illustrating K-shaped growth where value and premium both flourish. Notably, private label moved beyond me-too offerings: H-E-B’s Splashers+ includes 30% real fruit and 100% daily vitamin C, competing head-to-head with branded options at a 20% discount. Premiumization thrives on experiential cues in the US kids beverage market. Recyclable aluminum stubby bottles priced at $2.49 each, pioneered by PathWater Kids, signal both quality and eco-values. Parents surveyed by Mintel assign a “social currency” rating of 7.8/10 to premium packs visible in lunchboxes, indicating willingness to trade up for perceived status. Dynamic pricing analytics used by Kroger Precision Marketing reveal that promotional elasticity is two-times higher in households with annual incomes above $120 k, encouraging personalized digital coupons rather than across-the-board discounts. Operators should therefore deploy granular shopper-affinity data: spotlight rock-bottom value packs in food-insecure ZIP codes while upselling functional glass-bottle SKUs through Instacart in affluent suburbs. This bifurcated approach guards margin integrity while preserving volume, a balancing act essential for decision makers aligning portfolio breadth with the diverse economic realities of 2024. Innovative packaging boosts convenience, safety, and recycling participation rates nationwide Packaging has evolved from mere container to value-adding feature in the United States kids beverage market. Tetra Pak’s 2024 School Edge report notes that 54% of administrators now require tethered caps to reduce litter—technology first scaled by Kool-Aid Bursts Reload. Breathing valve pouches, such as those used by Slammers Chill’n, cut choking risk and meet ASTM F963-17 toy safety standards, a specification now embedded in Walmart’s Supplier Playbook. In parallel, spouted pouches with 30% post-consumer recycled (PCR) content have surged 41% in distribution; they not only reduce pack weight by 70% versus PET but also appeal to eco-conscious Gen-Alpha who routinely learn about recycling in school curricula. Smart packaging amplifies consumer engagement in the kids beverage market. Yakult Kids rolled out NFC-enabled labels that deliver augmented-reality games teaching gut-health facts, driving 2.3 minutes of average dwell time per scan. Meanwhile, Boxed Water Is Better Kids prints QR codes linking to carbon-offset certificates, reinforcing transparency as a brand pillar. Operationally, flat-bottom pouch formats achieve 12% higher pallet density, cutting freight emissions and enabling cost savings passed along in the form of bundle promotions—three packs for $5, a hit at Costco. Looking ahead, compostable high-barrier films from Futamura and Mold-Tek’s in-mold label cups promise to marry shelf life with circularity. Packaging engineers should therefore collaborate early with recycling-stream stakeholders to ensure that novel substrates are recognized by U.S. material recovery facilities, safeguarding claims and avoiding greenwashing accusations that can erode parental trust.

Amazon reigns online with a 46% share of digital kids-drink dollars, but brand-owned sites are scaling: Hint Kids Water grew its subscription base 55% YOY, boasting a churn rate below 6%. Grocery curbside pickup also matters—Albertsons’ DriveUp & Go logged a 23% lift in multipack flavored waters, fueled by “buy again” one-tap algorithms that simplify replenishment for busy parents. Last-mile efficiency underlies profitability in the kids beverage market. C-store delivery via DoorDash and Gopuff accounted for 11% of single-serve juice unit sales during post-school “3 p.m. spike” windows, an untapped exposure point for trial. Cold-chain integrity tech, like Vericool’s plant-fiber insulation, maintains 34–38 °F for eight hours, expanding the viable radius for perishable smoothies. Retail media networks (RMNs) close the loop: Kroger’s DSP can target ads to households that previously bought toddler purées, then measure incremental basket lift within 48 hours—capability that convinced Danone to double RMN spend in 2024. For decision makers, marrying DTC margins with omnichannel scale demands SKU rationalization: offer flavor variety packs online where digital shelf is unlimited, yet focus brick-and-mortar slots on velocity leaders to avoid out-of-stock fines. Seamless inventory visibility, order-management systems, and in-app loyalty hooks will determine who captures the at-home convenience dollar in the next growth wave.

Title: Germany's new chancellor: Who is Friedrich Merz?

He has never held a top position in government, yet he has become Germany's tenth chancellor. DW takes a look at the life of Friedrich Merz. Friedrich Merz has made it to the chancellery after a bumpy start. He needed an unprecedented second vote to secure the necessary majority in the Bundestag in what was a historic debacle in German politics. Now Merz's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) the regional Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) will be working together as Germany's new government. For Merz, it is a big step in an unusual career. Merz, who is 69 years old, has never held a top governmental office with significant leadership responsibilities. He has never been a federal minister, or a state premier, or even mayor of a small town. He is the oldest chancellor to take office since Konrad Adenauer, the first post-war German head of government (1949–1963). The previous weeks were also the first time he had ever taken part in negotiations aimed at forming a government coalition. The media, as well as some unnamed representatives from the negotiation teams, have at times held this against him. The SPD leaders, Lars Klingbeil and Saskia Esken, and the head of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), Markus Söder, all have experience in this particular kind of wrangling. But as the would-be head of government, Merz hopes to lead a coalition between the CDU and these parties, and mediate between their interests. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video According to the German business magazine Wirtschaftswoche, Merz is a "trans-atlanticist, friend of Europe, and reformer." This, it wrote, could mean he was "exactly the right person for the current times." From 1989 to 1994, Merz was a member of the European Parliament. This was followed by 15 years in the Bundestag, between 1994 and 2009, during which he rose to become head of the CDU's parliamentary group, only to lose out to Angela Merkel in a struggle for the party leadership. Over these years, he took a particular interest in Germany's relationship with the United States. A commercial lawyer, Merz hails from Sauerland, an area of North Rhine-Westphalia, east of the Ruhr, where he still lives. It's predominantly a middle-class, rural region, popular with tourists, that tends to espouse conservative, Catholic values. Merz was clearly more traditionally conservative than his East German rival, the quantum chemist Angela Merkel. Early in his career, he was a close confidant of the now-deceased veteran CDU politician Wolfgang Schäuble, who was a member of the German parliament for more than 50 years. Merz chose not to stand for parliament again in 2009, and went on to pursue a career in business. From 2016 to 2020, he was chairman of the supervisory board of the German arm of BlackRock, currently the world's largest asset management company, and during this time he was often in the United States on business. It wasn't until 2021 that Merz ran again for the Bundestag, and was elected. In fleshing out his plans for government, he has been more outspoken than his taciturn predecessorOlaf Scholz, Merz frequently makes a point of mentioning that, for several months now, he has been in regular contact with European heads of government: dinner with France's President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace, bilateral talks in Berlin or Brussels. He also intends to travel to the US before the summer recess to meet Republican President Donald Trump. In a particularly striking example, Merz gave an hour-long TV interview to the German political talk show Caren Miosga eight days before the Easter weekend, in which he spoke about continuing military aid to Ukraine, going significantly beyond the "red line" repeatedly drawn by Chancellor Scholz. Merz raised the prospect of Germany delivering Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv. These long-range, high-impact weapons would be of great assistance to Ukraine, and could seriously pressure Russia. He added that the UK, France, and US had already been supplying cruise missiles, and if the weapons supply was coordinated with its allies, "Germany should also participate." He commented that the Ukrainian army "has to get out of the defensive position — all it does is react." It needed to "be able to exert some control over what's happening." Merz even explicitly mentioned the possibility of Ukraine destroying the Crimean Bridge, a key strategic link between Russia and the unilaterally annexed Crimean peninsula. With this rhetoric and level of detail, Merz has positioned himself in direct opposition to Scholz, who consistently opposed Taurus deliveries and warned against any further escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Continued support for Ukraine is only one element of the broader political upheaval in Germany that has resulted from the policies of the new US administration — an upheaval that at times has caused Merz's standing and credibility to plummet. For months, both in the Bundestag and on the campaign trail, Merz and other conservative politicians emphasized the importance of adhering to Germany's debt brake, and called for fiscal discipline. This abruptly changed with the start of the exploratory talks between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. By mid-March, both of Germany's legislative chambers had approved a historically unprecedented decision: From now on, there will be no cap on defense spending. A package worth €500 billion ($570 billion) is also being introduced, aimed at improving Germany's crumbling infrastructure. This entails easing the debt brake to which, during the election campaign, the CDU and CSU had initially promised to adhere. Meanwhile, Merz — and all the mainstream parties — have the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) pressuring them from behind. Observers say the AfD's gains in the most recent election have prompted the future coalition partners to include stricter immigration policies and a greater focus on internal security in the coalition agreement. Just days before the federal election, Merz sparked controversy and confusion, both at home and abroad, by effectively weakening the "firewall" that he, along with all the other mainstream parties, had pledged to maintain against the AfD. Merz accepted the AfD's backing in several parliamentary votes on migration policy, in a bid to help the CDU/CSU and pro-business Free Deomcratic Party (FDP) defeat the remaining red-green votes, which by then no longer held a majority. This move triggered a wave of outrage among politicians and in German civil society. Now, Merz says he wants to boost the confidence of the German people. "We are a great country of more than 80 million people, who live and work here and take care of their families," he said. He wants to show "that the effort is worth it."

Title: Trump’s Tariff Threat To Hollywood Sparks More Questions Than Answers
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2025/05/06/trumps-tariff-threat-to-hollywood-sparks-more-questions-than-answers/

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. The Hollywood Sign seen in 2023 President Donald Trump declared Sunday night that his latest tariff target is the film industry. A post on his social network Truth Social said, “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” adding other countries’ incentives for filming movies—which often draw production to other shores—constitutes “a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” Trump’s directive: Authorizing the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative to “begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” Most people involved in the entertainment industry responded the same way: With a big question mark. It’s not clear what Trump is targeting: Films for U.S. audiences shot on location elsewhere? Foreign films with global distribution, like South Korea’s Parasite, the 2020 Best Picture Oscar winner? And are these just films for theatrical release or would it include movies and series made for streaming networks? Where and how would this tariff be applied? If enacted, this kind of tariff could deeply impact the film industry. Many of the last decade’s top grossing movies were made outside of the U.S. Investors sharply pulled back as markets opened on Monday, with Netflix initially seeing its stock drop 4% and losing $20.4 billion market capitalization—almost the total current value of Warner Bros. Discovery. The stock market closed with smaller losses for Netflix and other entertainment companies, including Disney and Paramount Global, but no more clarity on these potential tariffs from the White House. Not often one to agree with Trump, California Gov. Gavin Newsom entered the discussion Monday with his own proposal: The state would collaborate with the federal government to enact a $7.5 billion incentive program to help domestic movie production. It’s unclear if the White House will discuss the matter with Newsom. On Monday, Trump called Newsom a “grossly incompetent governor that allowed” the movie business to go to other countries. And it also remains to be seen if this proposal will advance. (After all, the Truth Social post that started the discussion was made half an hour after Trump used the social media platform to endorse reopening San Francisco’s Alcatraz as a federal prison, which got this response from Newsom to CBS Sacramento: “You can’t even come up with a more colossally bad fiscal idea.”) What it does show are two different approaches to the common goal of building domestic industry. Trump is reaching for tariffs, while Newsom is proposing incentives. Each has benefits and drawbacks, not least of which is the immediate response from industry and investors. How the issue plays out—if at all—will show the way policy and business intermingle, and what truly works today. Protecting data and advancing cybersecurity isn’t just the CIO’s responsibility, especially given how vital that information is to making future projections—and how costly data breaches can be. I talked to Abhesh Kumar, chief technology officer at financial advisory firm Springline Advisory, about how CFOs and CIOs can come together. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. A trader looks at different stock indexes on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at the ... More opening bell in New York City, on May 6, 2025. Last week, the markets fully recovered from the “Liberation Day” tariff announcement crash, with the S&P 500 seeing its longest winning streak since 2004. Investors were encouraged by better job growth than expected—177,000 non-farm jobs added from March to April, beating expectations of 133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics—and better-than-expected earnings reports from Big Tech, including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Inflation in March also moderated, according to Commerce Department data released last week, with the personal consumption expenditures index up 2.3% from last year, and core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—matching estimates of 2.6% in March. Even though these are positive metrics, they don’t necessarily indicate a recovering economy. While stocks have recovered from their low point in early April, markets are still down since Donald Trump’s presidency began in late January—the S&P is now 5% lower. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s first 100 days in office have been the worst for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 since President Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973. While there was more job growth than expected, a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that layoffs are way up—April’s cuts were up 63% compared to a year ago, and the more than 600,000 layoffs so far in 2025 are 87% higher than at this point in 2024. The firm found that 48% of the layoffs were tied to cuts made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci found troubling signs for employment underneath the strong job creation numbers. Worker confidence is down: 11.8% of the unemployed had left their jobs, down from 13.2% in January. Payroll numbers only increased by 0.3%, though inflation is much higher. Long-term unemployment is on the rise—1.9% of unemployed people have been without work for 15 weeks or longer, up from 1.4% in January. The economy as a whole also contracted significantly in the first quarter. According to the Bureau of Economic Research, GDP was down 0.3% compared with the last three months of 2024. That’s a drop from steady previous growth—GDP was up 2.4% in Q4—and the weakest growth since Q1 of 2022. Much of the drop in GDP came from fewer imports, as sweeping tariffs loom. And while the Trump administration has touted deals in progress—including talks to reduce a 145% tariff on China—nothing has been announced and Beijing says it is evaluating whether to negotiate. Tariffs are already reducing the amounts of goods shipped to the U.S. from China, setting the stage for fewer items on shelves in coming months, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Last week, the Trump Administration also eliminated the de minimis trade exemption, which allowed low-cost items from online retailers, including Temu and Shein, to be shipped to the U.S. duty-free. Now, items from those retailers are seeing a 145% tariff, more than doubling prices for U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, several companies anticipating a negative impact from tariffs for the rest of the year have reduced their estimates or pulled guidance. Pedestrians walk past the American lifestyle and performance footwear brand Skechers store in Hong ... More Kong. Skechers, the U.S.’s third-largest footwear company by sales, will be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital in a deal worth $9.4 billion. The deal will take the publicly traded company private, and is expected to close later this year. CEO and cofounder Robert Greenberg will remain in that role and continue to lead the company’s strategy, but he and his family will make $1.1 billion on the sale, writes Forbes’ Jemima McEvoy and Matt Durot. Last week, as part of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, Skechers signed a letter to Trump saying that tariffs posed an “existential threat” to the footwear industry, arguing that U.S. consumers would be unable to bear increased costs for shoes and that tens of thousands of industry jobs were on the line. A source close to the deal told CNBC that the timing and nature of the acquisition have nothing to do with tariffs and the current situation; 3G Capital has had its eye on Skechers as an acquisition target for some time. A sign outside of IRS headquarters in Washington, DC. The Trump Administration’s deep cuts to federal government employees have removed 11% of the workforce at the IRS so far, according to a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. The cuts are not spread evenly across the agency. Nearly a third of all revenue agents—usually CPAs who audit tax returns—who were there in January have been cut. About 18% of revenue officers, who focus on collections, are no longer there. About half of employees who are no longer at the IRS worked with small businesses and self-employed entities. Springline Advisory CTO Abhesh Kumar In today’s business world, data and cybersecurity threats are always multiplying. Abhesh Kumar, chief technology officer at financial advisory firm Springline Advisory, sees one way to strengthen both a company’s use and understanding of data and its security: Having finance and data or technology leaders work together on it. I talked to him about why this is an important partnership and how to make it work. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. What can help fill gaps in knowledge about data between CFOs and CIOs? Kumar: Both CTOs and CFOs need to take joint ownership as stewards of data assets. While technology [departments have] always taken the role of protecting all the data, in forward-leaning organizations such as Springline, CFOs are now embedding cybersecurity and data protection as part of their financial risk management. This is now getting recognized that the reputational risk, the compliance risk, and, frankly, the financial risk that could arise out of a lack of data protection could greatly cross even some of the more traditional forms of risk. This awareness comes back to the CTO or CIO and CFO working very closely and collaboratively as joint stakeholders in data protection and vulnerability management. There’s a cultural angle to it. Often CTOs and CFOs exist in siloed worlds. Leading by example and making joint appearances at the board level, where you’re seen as co-equal stakeholders in being the stewards of managing the protection of data assets, also drives a behavior down the chain of working in tandem and building that cohesion, which eventually reduces the blind spots for everybody. Some of the other things from a practical perspective will be proactive monitoring of threats and a proactive approach toward training and developing skill: Anti-phishing training, anti-social engineering trainings, deploying cybersecurity not as a one-off measure but embedding it into your business processes so that you are designing the system with cybersecurity at the front-and-center of your approach. With increased communication and collaboration, the chances of security being seen as a trade off between collaboration or innovation starts to blur, and a middle part starts to emerge where you can actually have the best of both words. You can be fairly agile and nimble in your business processes without really compromising or taking on non-compliance risk. A recent study from KPMG looking at the dynamic between CFOs and CIOs found that they both claim ownership of things dealing with data and tech, but have different viewpoints on what it’s for and why they’re doing it. Do you see this kind of difference of perception as an impediment to working together? I do not necessarily see it as an impediment. I actually see it as an opportunity to bring two diverse points of view together on a problem that will have collective impact on both stakeholders. The CFO and the CTO, it’s given that they have slightly different KPIs. Once they double-click and triple-click on some of the approaches towards protecting data assets, they will realize there’s rich and fertile ground for collaboration in elevating the data protection together. Technology risk can manifest itself in financial risk and damage, and financial risk can certainly bring down the technology pillar of the organization. I see it as a shared interest—even though both parties bring different points of view, but also different strengths and motivations to essentially do the right thing for the organization as a whole. That’s how I see it as an opportunity for collaboration. In fact, it’s all the more reason they should be collaborating, because the impact is greater on the whole than individuals. What advice would you give to a CFO to start working with their CIO or CTO in this manner? First, convince yourself that this is important, and talk to your CTO. Build that awareness of what the lack of good cybersecurity or data security procedures translates into dollar terms. CFOs understand dollar terms very clearly, and CTOs have to step up and be able to translate that risk. This is part of that collaboration: They need to make it easy for the CFO to understand because it is not just the loss of data. It’s the value of that data, plus reputational risk, compliance risk, disclosure risk for your clients. The CFO must understand the actual dollar impact of this risk, and then lead by example. CFO could be seen as a champion of cybersecurity by taking on an executive sponsor role for some of these defense mechanisms like training. That sends a message across the organization that this is something at the very senior level that’s being taken by the CFO. In return, the CFO gets enhanced security, enhanced visibility of the data and a close partnership with the technology department that protects their crown jewels. Legendary Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett unexpectedly announced over the weekend he would be stepping back from leading the firm at the end of the year, and plans to hand the company’s reins to Berkshire Hathaway Energy CEO Greg Abel. 1965: Year Buffett became Berkshire’s CEO 19.9%: Berkshire’s compounded annual gain from 1965 to 2024, nearly doubling the S&P 500’s 10.4% annual return ‘Just keep making the most of it’: Buffett’s advice to Berkshire shareholders, telling them they are already fortunate to be part of the U.S. It’s National Small Business Week, and this size of enterprise has many financial rules and regulations to comply with. In this week’s Forbes Tax Breaks newsletter, senior writer Kelly Phillips Erb goes over what small businesses need to know, and where they can learn more and get advice. If used properly, AI can make you a better leader and take on tasks ranging from complex analytical calculations to improving communication with employees. Here are some ways it can help many aspects of your business leadership. Which health insurance company announced last week it was leaving the Obamacare individual coverage business next year? A.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President Donald Trump’s tariffs rollout is frustrating U.S. companies’ planning for the rest of the year, preventing some corporate giants from telling investors what to expect and scrambling the broader outlook for stocks. Mattel and Ford each suspended their 2025 financial forecasts on Monday. The toy giant told investors that “given the volatile macroeconomic environment and evolving U.S. tariff landscape, it is difficult to predict consumer spending and Mattel’s U.S. sales in the remainder of the year and holiday season.” The company said that Barbie and Hot Wheels, its two flagship brands, were mostly manufactured outside of China, which faces a 145% effective tariff rate from the Trump administration. Still, CEO Ynon Kreiz told CNBC on Tuesday morning that Mattel was considering hiking prices for U.S. consumers to offset the costs of tariffs, which it estimated could come to about $270 million. “Where necessary, we will be taking pricing action in the U.S.,” Kreiz said. Mattel shares have declined by about 25% since February, when Trump first began discussing tariffs in greater detail. By comparison, the broader S&P 500 fell about 8% over the same period. “The shape of the toy industry has really changed,” said Brian Benway, senior tech and gaming analyst at the market research firm Mintel, who noted that Mattel’s products are increasingly sold in big-box retailers that are vulnerable to supply-chain snarls. The company said during its earnings call that it was prepared to increase direct imports to help stores keep shelves stocked. “Could we spin up more U.S.-based production? Yes. Will it be in the next five to 10 years? Probably not,” Benway said. Ford, too, put its outlook for the year on hold this week, citing lack of clarity about potential retaliatory tariffs from other countries, as well as how consumers may react to price increases. It joined other automakers including Dodge and Ram maker Stellantis, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz in pulling its annual guidance. Ford CEO Jim Farley warned the company’s hit from tariffs would be “huge.” Ford builds several models in Mexico that are sold in the U.S., including the popular electric Mustang Mach-E, Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport. Trump has softened his stance on tariffs somewhat, but so far no trade deals have materialized. That has left large and small companies alike facing tremendous uncertainty over how much the trade duties could hit their bottom lines. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to downplay the potential impact to consumers from tariffs despite campaigning on immediate economic relief. He told NBC News’ Kristen Welker on Sunday that Americans should in some cases be making do with less. “I’m just saying [Americans] don’t need to have 30 dolls, they can have three,” he said. “They don’t need to have 250 pencils,” he said. “They can have five.” Other companies are issuing multiple forecasts that take into account different economic scenarios. United Airlines said last month that “a single consensus no longer exists, and therefore the Company’s expectation has become bimodal — either the U.S. economy will remain weaker but stable, or the U.S. may enter into a recession.” Most other major airlines, including American, Delta and JetBlue, also either warned of lower earnings or suspended some guidance. Even some tech companies, many of which were thought to be largely immune from tariffs, signaled they could no longer forecast near-term financial results. That includes Snapchat parent Snap, which declined to issue guidance for the second quarter. But so far, stock investors have been relatively sanguine about the growing chorus of companies admitting they cannot navigate the current environment. Last week, the S&P 500 returned to the level it had reached before Trump gave his “Liberation Day” speech on April 2, after suffering weeks of heavy losses, though the index ended Monday in the red and was off to a rough start again Tuesday. “This is a tricky time for investors,” Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius said in a recent note to clients. “While the economy has held up a touch better than expected so far, it’s very early.” All things considered, he said, the recent rally is likely to dissipate in the face of what are likely to be “significant price hikes, supply chain disruptions, and job losses.” Other major companies reporting earnings this week include Disney, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International, Warner Bros. Discovery and Uber. Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. J.J.

ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Asian equities were mixed overnight as Hong Kong and Mainland China returned from holiday refreshed and in good spirits (similar to how I feel post-vacation), and Indonesia outperformed while Thailand underperformed. Japan was closed for Greenery Day, a holiday “dedicated to appreciating nature and expressing gratitude for its blessings.” South Korea was closed for Vesak Day, which is also Buddha’s Birthday. Hong Kong and Mainland China were driven higher by green shoots in U.S.-China trade talks last Friday and over the weekend, as well as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s positive comments yesterday. Asian currencies have made monster moves versus the U.S. dollar. The Taiwan dollar is up +7.29% and the offshore CNY (CNH) is up +0.96% since April 28. The Chinese people were on the move during the May Day holiday, with 101.7 million railway passengers and 11.15 million airline passengers, while 10.896 million foreigners visited China, according to Mainland media sources. According to the South China Morning Post, people opened their wallets, with 60,000 auto trade-in subsidy applications. Meanwhile, home appliance sales during the holiday were up +15.5% year-over-year, auto sales were up +13.7% YoY, communication equipment sales were up+10.5% YoY, and home and apartment sales data appear strong in the top 30 major cities. The April Caixin Services PMI was 50.7 versus expectations of 51.8 and March’s 51.9 as the month-over-month indicator declines from tariff front running. Hong Kong soft technology (internet), airlines, hotels, restaurants, and Macau casino stocks outperformed overnight. Hardware technology stocks, including biotechnology, and semiconductors, underperformed, led by index heavyweight Xiaomi, which was down -2.92%. Mainland investors bought a healthy $1.7 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs today as Meituan and Alibaba saw an inflow, while Tencent saw a small outflow. From a breadth perspective, Mainland China had a very strong day led by growth stocks, with 4,677 advancing stocks and only 396 declining stocks. Unlike Hong Kong, hard technology stocks had a very strong day, led by electronic equipment, semiconductors, software, and travel and consumer plays, such as airlines. Hopefully, the positive momentum continues! Investor’s Business Daily had an insightful article over the weekend titled, “The Trade War Comes Ashore,” providing a timeline of the coming tariff tsunami effect on store shelves and retail employment. Maritime consulting firm Drewry anticipates 2025 cargo volumes will decline for only the third time since 1979. The only two declines were the 2009 Global Financial Crisis and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Apollo Global Management believes that domestic freight and retail companies will begin layoffs by early June as “most retailers will have run through their stockpiled inventory.” Companies anticipating inventory issues mentioned in the article include Amazon, Target, and Walmart, though the list is far more expansive. Even if the U.S. and China governments make significant progress over the next few weeks, the American people will likely discover how reliant and intertwined our two economies are. I suspect most Americans don’t want their kids working in low-end manufacturing versus high-end manufacturing and innovation industries (brain versus brawn industries). Obviously, there are things that should be made here in the U.S. for national security reasons, but the vast majority of what is made in China and Asia more broadly and sold in U.S. stores doesn’t fit that criteria. Ultimately, not even politicians can overpower economic laws, just as President Hoover and Senators Smoot and Hawley learned nearly a century ago.

Editor Empire Canadian Patriot, Cynthia Chung There has been a great deal of criticism against the recent developments with the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison’s agreement to sell its Panama Canal ports, Cristobal and Balboa, to BlackRock. A sale that has been loudly backed by the Trump Administration. There has been especially a great deal of criticism by Trump and his administration over the operation of the Panama Canal claiming China has taken over control of this vital trade chokepoint and is causing the US to pay more than others for the use of the canal. There have even been accusations within the Trump Administration, including by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, that they are certain China plans to block America’s use of the Panama Canal completely. The accuracy of these accusations will be reviewed and discussed in detail in this series. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino earlier this year had made a public statement, in response to Trump’s accusations that China was controlling the Panama Canal, and published a strongly worded statement “wholly rejecting” Trump’s words and saying the canal would remain Panamanian. President Mulino added that no nation was interfering with the canal’s administration and that dialogue was the best way to resolve the issues Trump raised. He also disagreed with Trump’s characterisation of the US returning the canal to Panama.[1] “The canal wasn’t given by anyone, it was the result of a generational fight that culminated in 1999,” Mulino wrote on X.[2] However, after Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama after less than one month as US Secretary of State (Panama was first on the list of visits by Rubio, followed by El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic) he proudly stated in his interview with FOX News that Panama was the first country to exit from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and that he expects other Latin American countries to follow suit. Trump has repeatedly stated that the US built the Panama Canal and thus has the right to “reclaim it”. These developments and the history of US-Panamanian relations will be discussed in this series. China has been heavily criticized for the deferral of the BlackRock purchase, who has filed an anti-monopoly investigation launched by China’s State Administration of Market Regulation. This move has ignited accusations that China is overreaching in its legal reach. The accuracy of such accusations will be reviewed in this series. BlackRock’s role globally as well as domestically will also be reviewed in detail, and especially its direct role in influencing the economy and well-being of Americans. In addition, BlackRock’s role along with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) will be reviewed in what they are in fact proposing as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, along with an overview of BRI’s activities thus far. Through A Glass Darkly On matters of geopolitics, counterintelligence, revisionist history and cultural warfare. By Cynthia Chung As Trump has recently stated “China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.” Trump, in his first speech of his second term, denounced the so-called “deal” the US made decades ago to turn over the Panama Canal to Panamanians. “We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should never have been made,” Trump said during his inaugural speech. “And Panama’s promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.” In the weeks ahead of his inauguration, he threatened to have US reassert control of the Panama Canal, including possible military action the day after Christmas on his Truth Social platform. As has already been briefly mentioned, the President of Panama Jose Mulino disagreed with this statement by Trump that the Panama Canal was “given” to the Panamanians by the Americans but that this was the culmination of a long fight – a long fight for Panama’s sovereignty that is. Trump went on to state “Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous.” Trump also stated that “It was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else,” Trump said. “We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!”[3] Mulino dismissed these criticisms as well as Trump’s threats to retake the Panama Canal, stating “Every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama,” he said on a video posted on X. Mulino also stated “The canal has no direct or indirect control from China, nor the European Union, nor the United States or any other power,” Mulino continued “As a Panamanian, I reject any manifestation that misrepresents this reality.”[4] It should be noted here that President Mulino is a right leaning conservative and had very good relations with the US up until these recent accusations. Let us go over whether there is any validity to Trump’s statements and accusations. In a recent speech Trump claimed that the Panama Canal had left 38,000 Americans dead. He stated “The United States, I mean think of this, spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.” This is not remotely true. Rather, it is estimated that 25,000 people died that were French and Jamaican, during the first construction period, that were mostly from mosquito-borne viruses. Virtually none of those deaths were American.[5] Author Matthew Parker who wrote the book “Hell’s Gorge: The Battle to Build the Panama Canal” said that during the US period of construction from about 1904 to 1914 about 6,000 died, mostly all who were Bajans, i.e. from Barbados, with about 300 Americans who died in the effort.[6] These figures are largely in line with other estimates of the death toll in the efforts to build the canal, which was completed in 1914. That during the 1880s more than 22,000 workers from France died (many from malaria and yellow fever). Thus, it appears it is the French who have by a large margin the highest death toll in the construction of the Panama Canal. It should be noted that the Panama Canal was engineered by the same French engineer as the Suez Canal, it was not engineered by an American. Thus, the Panama Canal was engineered and largely built by the French, though it was the Americans who had colonised the territory (more on this history later in this series). It is curious as to where Trump got the number 38,000 and how he came to the conclusion that these were American deaths. Trump has also recently stated that “China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” Panama has been controlling the Panama Canal since 1999 after a treaty transfer. It is controlled through the Panama Canal Authority, an 11-member board that oversees the waterway’s maintenance and security. CK Hutchison won a bid in 1997 (thus before Panama even took control over the Panama Canal from the United States!) that allowed Chinese companies to operate in ports at the ends of the canal. But China is not the only one, the United States and Taiwan also have companies who are operating ports along the canal which is open to commerce from all countries. Only two out of the total five ports adjacent to the Panama Canal are owned by the Hong Kong company CK Hutchison. President Mulino has stated that the passage rates are determined by market conditions. There has been no evidence of unfair treatment in China’s favor as the BBC and Financial Times also acknowledge. It is also acknowledged by the BBC and Financial Times that there is no evidence that Chinese soldiers are positioned at these ports as Trump has claimed. For those who may still think there is credit to what Trump has been accusing China of concerning the Panama Canal. I suggest the reading the following excerpt from this article “The Chinese Interests in the Panama Canal Including Updates” published by the Newsroom Panama, here is an excerpt to which I would like to particularly highlight from their article: ‘The truth, nothing but the truth. Our family, friends, coworkers and acquaintances rely on our words and that is why we have to be as accurate as possible. To help in this effort of citizen diplomacy, here are the truths we must understand in order to share them with the world. False statement: “The United States gave the canal to Panama for one dollar ” Answer: In 1903, Panama authorized the United States to build a canal and gave permission to use land and water. Panama was severely limited in its own development, at a high human and economic cost. The canal was not free; we Panamanians had paid for it in advance and in full. False statement: “The Panama Canal charges excessively and represents a high cost to the United States economy. ” Answer: The Panama Canal toll represents 5% of the value of freight between Asia and the United States. 2.7% of world trade passes through the Canal ($33 trillion in 2024), but the Canal only generated revenues of about $6 billion. So it is not a cause of inflation but rather a huge subsidy to the economy of one of the most developed countries in the world. False statement: “38,000 U.S. citizens died during the construction of the Canal.” During the construction of the Panama Canal (1904-1914) 350 American citizens died, according to data contained in the Roberto F. Chiari Library of the Panama Canal. False claim: “The US Navy pays too much to cross the canal and is discriminated against by Panama.” The US Navy has free [i.e full access] passage through the Panama Canal, so there are no lines or reservations required. [In other words, the passage of the US Navy is prioritised through the Panama Canal.] Between 2015 and 2024, the US Navy only paid approximately $17 million in tolls to cross the Panama Canal. That’s less than $2 million a year. False claim: “The Chinese government controls the Panama Canal.” Answer: Panama controls, manages, supervises, regulates, cares for and maintains the Panama Canal. There are no Chinese military personnel stationed in Panama, instead, the Panama Canal Advisory Board is chaired by retired Admiral William J. Flanagan, who was head of the U.S. Southern Command. False claim: “The Chinese company that operates two ports at the entrances to the Panama Canal can close them whenever the Chinese government orders it.” Answer: The ports of Balboa and Cristobal are owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchinson. This company has 53 ports in 24 countries, including the United States, and by 2023 it had handled more than 81 million containers or the equivalent. This company is not included on any United States government list of restricted companies, as are other Chinese companies. It is important to understand that all ships entering and leaving the Panama Canal are captained by Panamanian Canal pilots, including ships going to the ports of Balboa and Cristobal. So at all times those ships are commanded by a Panamanian Panama Canal collaborator. Go ahead, take what is said here, put it into your own words and share it with the whole world. Only the truth and national unity will lead us to a safe harbor.’ Thus, the US does not appear to be receiving unfair treatment afterall. Rather the US pays more than any other country for the use of the Panama Canal because it accounts for 75% of the canal traffic in the fiscal year 2024, with China coming in at second with 21%. In other words, the passage rate is determined by the number of ship/cargo that is going through, thus, the US pays more since they have more ships/cargo going through. To claim that this is unfair treatment is a dishonest statement. As with Trump’s tariff war – threatening international companies to set up their factories in the US or face sky-high tariffs, in order to artificially boost the US economy without creating American jobs and manufacturing – it appears Trump is also upset with the Panama Canal simply because the United States is expected to pay for the use of a canal “they built” (no mention of the French ever…). There is no unfair treatment. There is no evidence of Chinese manipulation to restrict US access. The US simply does not want to pay, period. And they are using China as an excuse for why they feel justified in reclaiming an imperialistic agenda towards Panama. Think about it for a moment. The United States is doing the very thing that they have been trying to scapegoat China’s BRI on, that because the US “built” the Panama Canal when Panama was a colony of theirs, that means it is theirs forever and they get to do with it as they wish despite Panama being a sovereign country now?!? Isn’t that exactly what they were accusing China would eventually do, but actually hasn’t? Is the US going so far as to justify that it needs to become an imperialistic empire in order to defend the world from China’s business? Sounds awfully similar to Churchill’s NSC-75 when the United States was dragged into defending Britian’s colonial interests worldwide in order to so-called save the world from Soviet communism. Yes, subject countries were told they had to continue being British colonies in order to fight communism…. One wonders if that is what spurred Trump’s recent musings to actually join the British Commonwealth while in the presence of King Charles. So there does not really seem to be any Chinese coercion after all. Rather, it appears that Trump simply does not want to pay Panama for the use of the canal, while other countries would be expected to do so. And the way the wind is blowing, it looks like it is rather the US who wishes to cut China out of the use of the Panama Canal, one of the most strategic trade routes globally. And the US apparently feels justified in this, all because they apparently built and gave the Panama Canal to the Panamanians – which is a very dishonest account of this history which will be reviewed in detail later in this series. However, for now, if you wish to know more about the real role the United States played in Panama you can watch this Oscar winning documentary “The Panama Deception” (1992) for free on youtube here which goes over the real reasons for the US invasion of Panama in December 1989. When President Mulino had made his public statement that “Every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama” Trump directly responded to this statement by Mulino on his Truth Social platform with “We’ll see about that!” and posted shortly after an image of the American flag with “Welcome to the United States Canal!”. This was reposted by Elon Musk with “2025 is gonna be so lit” laughing emojis. The level of hypocrisy of these statements are hopefully sinking in. And the accusations of China are more and more looking like guilty confessions of what the US desires for itself. This will be confirmed time and time again as we go further in this series. It does not seem to be about China’s so-called use of power and influence in the canal after all, but about the US reclaiming a former colonial asset. And it just so happens that that is BlackRock’s speciality. The deal between CK Hutchison and BlackRock consortium was unveiled in March, which saw BlackRock team up with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Terminal Investment Limited to purchase CK Hutchison’s global port operations, spanning 43 ports in 23 countries (out of their total which is 53 ports in 24 countries). Included within this deal were the Panama Canal ports, Cristobal and Balboa. The Panama Canal handles roughly 3-5% of global maritime trade, with the United States accounting for nearly 75% of canal traffic and China coming in at second with 21%. The Hong Kong based CK Hutchison, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, stood to profit $22.8 billion (enterprise value) selling BlackRock 80% ownership of CK Hutchison’s portfolio of 43 global ports and in a parallel agreement for 90% ownership of their Panama Ports Company, which operates the terminals in Balboa and Cristobal, in the Panama Canal. For BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $11.6 trillion under its belt, the acquisition promised $1.7 billion in annual revenue, marking a bold expansion into infrastructure from its more traditional ventures in stock and bond investments. News of the deferral of a signing date for the deal came along with news that China had launched an antitrust review in March. The antitrust investigation was to probe the impact on China’s interests and national security if the deal went through, essentially whether it would cause unfair competition. In other words, to assess whether BlackRock’s acquisition could lead to a monopoly on specific routes, such as Asia-Americas, which could form a global monopoly network. China could counteract through tools like the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, but it would need to balance the conflicts with international law and diplomatic costs. The parties (CK Hutchison and BlackRock) have 145 days to exclusively and confidentially negotiate the final terms of this sale. Beyond the 145 days of this exclusivity period, CK Hutchison has the right to sell the assets to other parties. Once the deal is signed there will be no leeway for negotiations or backing out. Other than BlackRock, the consortium comprises of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Terminal Investment Limited, funded by BlackRock and run by the Mediterranean Shipping Company or MSC. U.S. President Donald Trump had hailed the BlackRock transaction as a positive step at “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. More recent developments have further complicated this deal between CK Hutchison and BlackRock after an audit by the Panamanian authorities, which began this past January closely following Trump’s accusations of “unfair” treatment blaming the Chinese. The audit claims to have found contractual violations that amount to $1.3 billion in unpaid fees and alleged tax evasion from the Hong-Kong based company. The audit is of most suspicious timing on CK Hutchison which has been operating these ports for over 28 years. It is not so much the accusation that CK Hutchison owes $1,3 billion in fees but rather that this has been used to justify revoking CK Hutchison’s concession over the ports. If this goes through, CK Hutchison stands to lose the ports overnight. It is acknowledged even by the Financial Times that this audit is in fact a “nod to Donal Trump” and clearly in opposition to the President of Panama’s statements of Panama’s sovereignty in this matter. Financial Times writes in their article “Panama begins an audit of Hong Kong company in nod to Donald Trump” published January 21, 2025: Panama’s government on Monday began an audit of a Hong Kong company that operates ports at either end of its canal, after US President Donald Trump warned that he wanted to take back the waterway over alleged Chinese influence. … In response, Panama’s Office of the Comptroller General published a video on social media platform X of about 10 men and women in suits filing off a bus into the local offices of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to begin an audit, in a move seen as a nod to Trump. “Today our auditors arrived at [the company] to start an exhaustive audit aimed at guaranteeing efficient and transparent use of public resources,” the comptroller general’s office said on X. Llegada del equipo de Contraloría encargada de realizar la auditoría a Panama Ports Company.#ContraloríaPanamá #CGRPanamá #Transparencia pic.twitter.com/O4jtRRj2rR — Contraloría General de la República de Panamá (@ContraloriaPma) January 20, 2025 … China does not control the canal, but some officials in Washington are increasingly concerned about Chinese companies’ presence in the area. … Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino — a law and order conservative — on Monday published a strongly worded statement “wholly rejecting” Trump’s words and saying the canal would remain Panamanian. He added that no nation was interfering with the canal’s administration and that dialogue was the best way to resolve the issues Trump raised. He also disagreed with Trump’s characterisation of the US returning the canal to Panama. “The canal wasn’t given by anyone, it was the result of a generational fight that culminated in 1999,” he wrote on X. CK Hutchison’s Panama Ports Company (PPC) has had a concession to operate the ports of Balboa and Cristobal since 1997, which was renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. Again, this contract was given to CK Hutchison two years before the Panamanian government gained control of the Panama Canal in 1999 from the United States. What this means, is that it was in fact the United States itself who first allowed the concession to CK Hutchison for use of these ports. Perhaps they thought nothing of it at the time since Hong Kong had a legacy of 99 years as a British colony, the effects of which would not leave the region anytime soon. And was being returned to a disempowered China that same year, 1997. However, Panama’s Comptroller General[7] (i.e. manager of public funds) Anel Flores’s withering assessment has called into question CK Hutchison’s concession renewal in 2021 and has accused the company of flagrant procedural breaches and financial mismanagement. The comptroller’s office intends to file criminal charges against officials who greenlit the 2021 renewal, while Panama’s Maritime Authority now faces pressure to revoke the concession entirely.[8] Other than the Panamanian ports, the BlackRock deal with CK Hutchison was the purchase of 41 other overseas port operations (out of its total 53 ports). The two ports in Hong Kong are also included in the total count of the ten ports located in China. Thus, CK Hutchison was willing to sell all of its overseas port operations excluding only the ten ports that were located in China, for reasons that should be clear. As we can appreciate from these maps of the port locations that CK Hutchison was willing to sell to BlackRock, selling 43 out of their total 53 ports, we can begin to appreciate the concern China might have in BlackRock acquiring a monopoly of trade routes, especially since BlackRock has made it no secret that it intends to counter China’s BRI. It is for this reason that Chinese articles had called this deal a “betrayal of all Chinese people.” CK Hutchison was willing to hand-over all of its overseas ports, which are located in vital trade routes to a company that is publicly opposed and antagonistic to China’s global trade. Imagine if the situation were reversed and an American company had done this, the reaction would be no less. In addition, it has now more recently come out that the other entity to stand to benefit from this deal, to which BlackRock is working for, is the Swiss-Italian Aponte family who own the world’s largest container line and has a 20.3% market share, according to shipping data provider Alphaliner. Sources told the South China Morning Post that the Aponte family was the mysterious driving force behind the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) that aimed to solidify its dominance at sea. MSC was the one that stood to acquire the 41 ports in 22 countries through its arm Terminal Investment Limited (TiL) in partnership with BlackRock. Under the proposed deal BlackRock would acquire the two ports in the Panama Canal. If MSC successfully acquires these 41 ports they will potentially become the world’s largest container terminal operator.[9] South China Morning Posts’ article “Twist in Hutchison ports deal as Italian shipping family’s role surfaces” writes: “The partnership with BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners highlights the scale and financial muscle behind the family’s ambitions, allowing MSC to leverage significant investment capital while retaining operational influence over these vital port facilities. … While Geneva-based MSC keeps its financial results private, Italian media reported that the company’s equity was €91 billion in 2022, with net profits of €36.2 billion.” Who is the Aponte family? According to The Swiss Times, the Aponte family who owns the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) in Geneva was “recently crowned the richest family in Switzerland thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic and western buying habits. But the notoriously secretive family has also come under fire for how they may have obtained their success: making friends with politicians and turning a blind eye to shipping some nefarious items.” The Swiss Times continues in “How the pandemic helped make the richest family in Switzerland” published October 17th, 2022: The Aponte family is famously tight-lipped; they have never confirmed their wealth and have declined to give any interviews to media outlets. Moreover, MSC is the only major shipping company to have never published financial figures and it is not even listed on the stock exchange. The price of shipping by frigate increased six-fold during the pandemic. American shipping expert John McCown estimates the company made $26.6 billion in profits between June 2021 and June 2022. “MSC earns as much as three-quarters of Facebook” McCown told 24 Heures, meaning that the family now has about $100 billion net worth. This places the family just below Bill Gates (fifth richest person in the world) and above Warren Buffet, according to Forbes’ billionaire ranking. Before the pandemic, the Aponte family did not crack the list of the top 100 wealthiest people in the world and now they likely rank among the top 10. How did this happen? While many economists predicted that global trade would collapse during the 2020 Covid pandemic, homebound Americans went on an online spending spree – making shipping one of the most in-demand industries at the time. The explosion in demand – coming mostly from the U.S. for products made in Asia – peaked in 2021 as bored Americans bought laptops, Pelotons, furniture and clothes. The congestion in supply chains caused shipping prices to soar. A container that once cost $2,700 to ship now cost $15,000 or more. Essentially, costs multiplied sixfold during a 12-month period. The Aponte family “made more money than in the entire previous decade” during the pandemic, an MSC spokesperson told Le Matin Dimanche. Even U.S. President Joe Biden called out MSC for raising their prices by 1000 percent to the detriment of “American families and businesses.” And while shipping prices are now declining, they still remain about three times higher than they were in 2019, according to shipping experts from maritime research firm Drewry. The prices remain that way because MSC has global influence at this point. The family decides on “the price, the availability, the deadline,” a former MSC employee told Le Matin, adding “Today, they feel untouchable.” Last year – at the height of MSC’s pandemic earnings – it came to light how the Aponte family cultivated a friendship with Alexis Kohler, who has served as the secretary general to France and the right-hand man to French President Emmanuel Marcon since 2017. Kohler began working at the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance and slowly climbed his way up to become director of Macron’s cabinet in 2014. When Macron resigned from that position in 2016 to begin working on his presidential campaign, Kohler became the financial director of MSC Cruises in Geneva, earning nearly CHF 500,000 [Swiss Francs] per year – more than most senior directors at MSC. During this time, Kohler was allowed to take a half day or day off each week to work on Macron’s presidential campaign. During the same period, Kohler, his wife, and three children went on eight vacations on Aponte family yachts, as well as staying at their ski chalet in Megève. It was also during this time that Kohler was privy to sensitive information regarding MSC’s contract with the French shipyards of Saint-Nazaire. MSC has spent more than 20 billion euros building cruise ships in Saint-Nazaire, according to Mer et Marine. It has been a symbiotic relationship: MSC funnels business into the shipyards, and about 80 percent of the construction was financed by bank loans from the French government, according to Mediapart. In 2021, French anti-corruption investigators from Anticor searched the MSC offices in Geneva on suspicion of “successive conflicts of interest” between Kohler and MSC. Kohler, his family, and the Aponte family say they have never discussed the Saint-Nazaire shipyards or financing MSC cruise ships, but just two weeks ago the French government served Kohler a conflict-of-interest lawsuit. Luckily for Kohler, the offense does not exist under Swiss law, so he is presumed innocent here. But in France, Kohler may still face a trial. Illegal shipments In 2019, a MSC ship traveling from Brazil to Europe ran aground in American waters. U.S. authorities discovered about 20 tons of cocaine hidden on board. MSC had to pay $50 million for the U.S. to release the ship. The discovery gave credence to the widely-held belief that Brazil was funding Antwerp’s European drug market. Since then, Belgian port authorities have tightened security by adding thermal cameras to their ports. Then at the end of 2021, authorities at a Yemen port discovered another 200 kilos of drugs aboard an MSC ship coming from South America. In January of 2022, MSC announced they would halt all South American shipments until further notice. MSC only finally cracked down because drug cartels made threats against the company, its customers, and business partners, according to Belgian state media outlet RTBF.”[10] The close relationship MSC has with the Macron government will become further relevant as we look into the role of BlackRock who was selected by the G7 to oversee the Build Back Better World (B3W) agenda. Again, BlackRock was working in partnership with MSC in attempting to secure the purchasing of these 43 ports worldwide owned by CK Hutchison. BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager was also selected by the G7 to oversee the acquiring of infrastructure worldwide in service to B3W, which was later called the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII). It is curious as to how Trump supporters appear to have no questions about this new alliance between the Trump Administration and BlackRock, who have in the past been heavily critical of BlackRock’s activities. Let us take a closer look at BlackRock shall we? In less than one month after Joe Biden’s election win, it was announced that two BlackRock executives would join his administration, taking on roles at Treasury and the National Economic Council. Wall Street bankers, particularly from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have long held senior positions in the White House. In the case of Biden’s administration, these positions were largely filled by BlackRock executives. Eric Van Nostrand, a BlackRock managing director who was head of research for sustainable investments and multi-asset strategies joined the Biden Treasury Department and worked as a senior adviser on economic issues tied to Russia and Ukraine. Not so coincidentally, Zelensky later announced in 2023 that the world’s largest investment company would be in charge of creating a fund for rebuilding Ukraine…which was BlackRock. Zelensky’s official Ukrainian government website reports: “President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting with the management of the largest asset management company in the world — BlackRock. The parties discussed the details of the creation of an investment fund to restore the economy of Ukraine with the involvement of public and private capital. At the meeting, Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy signed an agreement with BlackRock Financial Market Advisory on providing support services to the Ukraine Development Fund. The main goal of the fund’s creation is to attract private and public capital for implementing large-scale business projects in Ukraine.” In other words, this deal is about “rebuilding” Ukraine with infrastructure that will be privatized and owned by the largest asset management company – BlackRock. Ukraine will own nothing as a result of this deal. Ukraine has been one big shell company and laundromat for the dirty offshore tax havens of billionaires with direct ties to the City of London since Ukraine’s so-called independence in 1991. Readers should be aware that current Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky was found to also be concealing assets offshore in the Pandora Paper’s revelations. According to the Pandora Papers, Zelensky and his inner circle were the beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize, including some that owned expensive London property. There has not been an official inquiry as to whether Zelensky’s offshore holdings are indeed implicated in tax evasion and bank fraud, however, we do know that Zelensky is indeed implicated in this by the mere fact that the majority of his funding up until he became president of Ukraine had come from Ihor Kolomoisky, who was also named in the Pandora Papers, and whose PrivatBank was found guilty of embezzlement. Recall it was Joe Biden, as vice-president of the United States, who publicly bragged on a Council on Foreign Relations platform in 2018 that he would only deliver a loan to Ukraine for economic aid if the Ukrainian prosecutor Shokin was fired who was at the time investigating Burisma Holdings for corruption charges. Where Biden’s son Hunter had allegedly received $3.5 million from the company at the expense of Ukrainians. Thus, it should be no surprise that BlackRock was Biden’s pick to implement his bizarrely titled “Build Back Better World” initiative as a counter to China’s Belt and Road. This Build Back Better World initiative of Biden, which was supported by the G7, was sold as something that would compete with China and meet the “tremendous infrastructure needs of low and middle-income countries…Build Back Better World (B3W), a…transparent infrastructure partnership led by major democracies to help narrow the $40 trillion infrastructure need in the developing world…”[11] Later B3W would be effectively renamed as Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), what would continue after the Biden administration as G7’s “flagship infrastructure and investment initiative” in the words of the Biden administration’s White House statement. At the 2024 G7 Leaders’ Summit on June 13th it was made crystal clear that BlackRock would be leading this PGII initiative to meet the infrastructure needs of low and middle-income countries in the developing world. According to a Biden Administration’s White House briefing room statement: “In support of the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) topline goal of mobilizing $600 billion in infrastructure investment in emerging economies, a coalition of U.S. investors highlighted and committed anew billions of dollars in private investment in scaled infrastructure in emerging markets, aligned with PGII priorities…The meeting confirmed the commitment to launching and scaling investments around PGII economic corridors globally, including corridors in Asia, Africa, and one connecting Europe to Asia through the Middle East, noting appreciation for the wide range of current and future investment by private companies in strategic sectors, such as finance for green energy and digitalization.” In a FACT SHEET released by the Biden Administration it was confirmed that at this G7 summit, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella were invited to lead the G7 meeting in discussing the buying up of infrastructure globally which will be privatized and managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). Who owns the Global Infrastructure Partnership (GIP) in 2024? BlackRock does. The Biden White House FACT SHEET continues stating: “Microsoft and BlackRock each highlighted billions in investment in support of PGII priorities, including Microsoft investing nearly $5 billion in digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, skilling, and other capacity building in Kenya, Indonesia, and Malaysia, plus additional infrastructure investments and other initiatives in Thailand and the Philippines.” Thus, this is effectively a BlackRock and Microsoft led endeavour in the execution of the G7’s PGII as a counter to China’s BRI. Nothing concerning about that arrangement right? BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, managing over $10 trillion. What that means is BlackRock manages trillions of dollars of wealth that is primarily owned by billionaires around the world. Its job is to find out ways to invest the money of the rich so that they can become wealthier. BlackRock has traditionally invested in stocks and bonds (with its counterpart Blackstone investing in infrastructure, more on this in part II of this series). However, with BlackRock’s recent venture into investment in infrastructure globally, what this amounts to, is the acquiring and privatization of key strategic infrastructure globally to service the billionaire class. These key infrastructures will be privatized under BlackRock and will charge a fee for their use. Such as Malaysia’s airports… We can see now how the Aponte’s close relationship to the Macron government is also in line with this agenda. Thus, the attempt to buy up these 43 ports from CK Hutchison – who clearly desires to wipe its hands clean and step out of this dangerous global game – such a deal would stand to directly benefit PGII agenda which appears to be more interested in benefiting a class of billionaires than the people of these developing nations. And to cut out China from strategic global trade routes. Thus, the G7’s PGII under management of BlackRock’s GIP is intending on doing the very thing that the United States has been falsely claiming China’s BRI of doing. Under the PGII framework, infrastructure will be acquired in the developing world and these countries will have to pay to use these essential infrastructures within their own countries. They will own nothing. Rather ownership of these key infrastructures will be amongst a global billionaire class to which BlackRock is in service to. What this means is that your local government may privatize the water grid or the power grid or the garbage disposal service or it might simply privatize the roads and they will be bought up by some of these asset manager funds on Wall Street and they will hike up the prices, charge monopoly rents, charge you more and more fees to use these basic services. This is not just the plan for the “developing” countries of the world. It is the plan for within the United States as well. In fact, it has been already ongoing for decades under Blackstone, one of the primary backers to Trump’s more recent presidential campaign. Blackstone has had a long legacy of buying up American infrastructure such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools. When these infrastructures came under the ownership of Blackstone which is the world largest commercial landlord, all sorts of budget cuts were made to the detriment of health and educational services. Budget cuts even included cuts to food for patients. Part II of this series will discuss this in detail, however, for now you can read more on this here and here and here and here. In addition, Blackstone is responsible for buying up homes and is largely responsible for the inflation of house prices such that most Americans today cannot afford decent housing. In fact, they made a killing during the 2008 financial crisis. Again, more on this in Part II of this series. Americans should question how Trump is fine accepting money from an asset manager company who works for the interests of billionaires to the devastation of America’s real economy and real jobs. However, it does explain Trump’s enthusiasm in his backing of BlackRock’s attempt to claim the two Panama Canal ports. After all, as the CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink has proudly acknowledged, BlackRock started as Blackstone… Cynthia Chung is the President of the Rising Tide Foundation and author of the books “The Shaping of a World Religion” & “The Empire on Which the Black Sun Never Set,” consider supporting her work by making a donation and subscribing to her substack page Through A Glass Darkly.

Title: Rite Aid files for bankruptcy a second time
URL: https://www.wtae.com/article/rite-aid-files-bankruptcy-again/64675282
Time Published: 2025-05-06T13:56:17Z
Full Content:
Rite Aid on Monday announced it is filing for bankruptcy for a second time, barely just seven months after the chain exited Chapter 11 and emerged as a private company. The financially strapped drug store chain said it is looking for a buyer, and re-filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will help facilitate that process. The company said it would keep its stores open throughout its bankruptcy. “While we have continued to face financial challenges, intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and healthcare landscapes in which we operate, we are encouraged by meaningful interest from a number of potential national and regional strategic acquirors,” said Matt Schroeder, Rite Aid’s CEO, in a statement. “As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible.” Rite Aid first filed for bankruptcy in October 2023, becoming a casualty of a miserable environment for drug stores, exacerbated by its runner-up status to bigger chains and expensive legal battles for allegedly filling unlawful opioid prescriptions that pushed its debt to nearly $4 billion. It took about a year to navigate the Chapter 11 process, finally emerging in September 2024 by slashing $2 billion in debt, securing $2.5 billion in funds to keep operating, and the closure of about 500 locations. On Monday, Rite Aid said it secured nearly $2 billion in new financing to keep it operational during its bankruptcy. Rite Aid is a distant third-largest nationwide standalone pharmacy chain in the United States — and the seventh largest pharmacy overall, when taking into account big box chains. It has about 1,250 stores remaining — roughly half of the number it had just two years ago. It was offered a $17 billion lifeline in 2015 when Walgreens offered to buy the chain. But the deal was met with stiff scrutiny from US regulators who feared the combination would violate federal antitrust laws and reduce competition in the drug store market. Ultimately, in 2017, the companies agreed to a smaller, $4.4 billion deal, in which Walgreens bought just under 2,000 Rite Aid locations, leaving Rite Aid diminished in stature and unable to compete at the scale of its bigger rivals. Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, a data analytics company, said he was not surprised by Rite Aid’s second bankruptcy, since the drug store chain hasn’t been able to secure enough inventory to keep shelves stocked. “The first bankruptcy did little to resolve the chain’s issues, and it has been teetering on the edge of survival for quite some time,” Saunders said. With Walgreens no longer in a position to buy Rite Aid outright, the most likely outcome is that other drug store and retail chains will “cherry pick” individual Rite Aid stores to purchase and keep open, Saunders said. Rite Aid’s bankruptcy comes amid struggles for its rivals, too. Walgreens Boots Alliance announced in March that it’s being taken private in a deal valued up to $24 billion, following a largely disastrous run on the public markets where its market cap has lost billions and more than 1,200 of its locations have closed or plan to close. The transaction is expected to be finalized later this year. At CVS, the chain has closed more than 1,000 stores and undergone thousands of layoffs over the past several months. The company is experimenting with a new, smaller-format store that only focuses on the pharmacy rather than the retail part. All three chains have struggled with declining prescription reimbursements in recent years, sending its value plummeting to just around $9.5 billion from $100 billion a decade ago. They have also all become ubiquitous and over-expanded, with the chains becoming synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick-up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they’ve struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability.

Title: Hollywood is the latest industry to get skittish about Trump's tariffs

Good morning! Some of the world's elite gathered for the Met Gala last night. (My invite must have got lost in the mail.) Here's a rundown on how the event went. We also made our picks for who was the best-dressed — and who missed the mark. In today's big story, President Donald Trump has targeted movies made outside the US with his latest tariffs, but no one really knows what it means. I know your inbox is already pretty full, but you're going to want to make room for this. Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr on what's happening at the world's most powerful tech companies, is launching soon. Subscribe here! What's on deck Markets: Warren Buffett's retirement announcement was a downer for Berkshire Hathaway's stock. Tech: Former Meta employees shared what it was like to be laid off as "low performers." Business: Austin is the first battleground for Tesla and Waymo's driverless taxis to face off. But first, lights! Cameras! Tariffs! If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. EXT: PORT OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY - DAY A walking film reel departs from a European container ship and approaches a customs officer awaiting exiting passengers. FILM REEL Hello! I'm the new summer blockbuster, and I'm ready for the big screen! CUSTOMS AGENT Not until you pay up on these tariffs! My first attempt at screenwriting might not make sense, but the same could be said for President Donald Trump's latest tariff announcement focused on Hollywood. On Sunday, the president said he'd save Hollywood from "dying a very fast death" due to productions shifting out of the country by imposing a 100% tariff on movies made outside the US. The problem, as Business Insider's Peter Kafka points out in this piece, is that no one quite understands what putting tariffs on films made outside the US means or how it would work. Trump isn't wrong that tax incentives and labor costs have led Hollywood to look overseas. But how would one enforce these tariffs? What level of work done on a movie outside the US would trigger the tariffs? And, as my short film above illustrates, how do you even tariff something that doesn't physically arrive here via cargo ships or planes? (You can read more about Peter's theories here. Hint: Tax breaks and other financial incentives.) Trump said Monday afternoon he was "not looking to hurt the industry; I'm looking to help." What's not debatable was the industry's initial reaction. Shares of top streamers and movie companies like Netflix and Walt Disney took a dip Monday morning. Maybe the best way to understand these latest tariffs is to look at them more holistically. At least, that was the pitch from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday at the Milken conference, where BI's Bradley Saacks was in attendance. In front of a crowd of the world's biggest and most powerful asset managers, Bessent made the case that the administration's overall trade plans were part of a three-pronged approach. Tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation work together "to solidify our position as the home of global capital," Bessent told the group. The framing was meant to help investors digest the volatile first 100 days of Trump's presidency, thanks largely to his focus on tariffs. Carlyle CEO Harvey Schwartz and Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson, who followed Bessent's speech, said tying together tariffs with deregulation and tax cuts was a good way to articulate Trump's broader plan. Whether the rest of the attendees agreed remains to be seen. 1. It's time to start rooting for the rich. The wealthy don't like higher prices, but they're spending through it. Their buying habits are holding up the consumer-driven US economy — but if they start to cut back, everyone else will feel the contraction. 2. Berkshire Hathaway's stock tumbles on Buffett news. The conglomerate's stock dropped as much as 7% on Monday after Warren Buffett announced his retirement over the weekend. Shareholders are wondering what Berkshire will look like without Buffett at the helm. 3. Elite colleges are rushing to the bond market. MIT plans to sell $750 million worth of taxable bonds, according to May 2 preliminary offering documents. It joins a list of elite colleges that have tapped the bond market as the Trump administration threatens to slash federal funding for universities. 1. Meta's "low performers" on those brutal layoffs. Eight former employees told BI what it was like to be caught in the company's sweeping job cuts — and the stigma that comes with being labeled a "low performer." 2. Amazon rewards consistently high performers. The retail giant is revamping its pay structure to better recognize and reward long-term high performers, per internal guidelines obtained by BI. The compensation overhaul reflects a wider trend happening across Big Tech. 3. Microsoft's controversial management approach. The software giant is putting some ousted low performers on a two-year rehiring ban and identifies these job cuts as "good attrition," according to an internal document viewed by BI. It's similar to hardcore performance-management strategies used at Meta and Amazon. 1. Tesla vs. Waymo. The two companies' driverless taxis will go head-to-head in Austin in June, when Tesla launches its services in the city. Here's how the robotaxis compare on cost, training, business strategy, and more. 2. OpenAI says its nonprofit will remain in control after all. In September, the AI giant announced it was moving to a for-profit business model. Read the letter CEO Sam Altman sent to employees explaining the decision to reverse course. 3. Google wants the star power. The tech company quietly launched a film and TV production initiative called 100 Zeros, BI has learned. Google hopes 100 Zeros will boost its image among Gen Z, but it plans to skip out on YouTube as a distributor. President Trump hosts Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House.

Title: States Halting Efforts to Create Strategic Bitcoin Reserves
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/states-halting-efforts-to-create-strategic-bitcoin-reserves/
Time Published: 2025-05-06T12:52:22Z
Full Content:
Soon after taking office, President Donald Trump floated plans for a strategic bitcoin reserve. It was part of a larger push by the president, backed by the digital asset sector, to turn the U.S. into the world’s cryptocurrency capital. However, similar efforts to create bitcoin reserves have begun to flounder on the state level. The latest example comes from Florida, where, per a report Tuesday (May 6) by Decrypt, a pair of bills designed to allocate up to 10% of select public funds to bitcoin were withdrawn. As that report notes, Florida joins Arizona, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wyoming on the list of states that have rejected crypto treasury legislation this year. In some states legislation made it past both chambers before the state’s governor vetoed the bills. That’s what happened last week in Arizona, when Gov. Katie Hobbs rejected legislation that would have invested a portion of the state’s retirement fund into bitcoin. “Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу,” Hobbs wrote in a letter to the state senate president. According to the Decrypt report, as of early May there were 36 active bitcoin reserve bills in 19 states. Just two weeks ago, there were more than 45 such pieces of legislation in more than two dozen states. This legislative back-and-forth is happening, as PYMNTS wrote recently, amid a growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. “Observers believe it is becoming increasingly held, across Wall Street and beyond, that digital assets may no longer be confined to speculative circles,” that report said. “As bitcoin ETFs become a growing component of diversified portfolios and regulatory frameworks begin to crystallize, the decentralization dream that once defined crypto appears to be giving way to a new era of structured integration.” And while it’s no longer a novelty to see major investment firms delving into crypto, this year has marked a turning point. Morgan Stanley is preparing to offer cryptocurrency trading to its massive E*Trade user base as soon as 2026, a move that could bring digital asset investments to millions of customers. At the same time, Charles Schwab is preparing to offer spot crypto trading for bitcoin and ethereum sometime this year to address increasing demand from traditional investors. “These moves are not isolated,” the report added. “BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is pushing blockchain technology deeper into conventional finance. The firm recently announced plans to register a new share class of its $150 billion money market fund on a blockchain, a step designed to enhance transparency and operational efficiency.” States Halting Efforts to Create Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Wonder Aims to Expand Meal Prep Biz After Raising $600 Million CFPB Reportedly Reworking Biden-Era Open Banking Rule Joor CEO: Retail Is Reeling as 'Uncertainty Kills Economies' We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

On May 5 and 6, 2025, a diverse group of companies across technology, consumer staples, automotive, financial services, healthcare, utilities, and basic materials will release their Q1 2025 earnings. These reports will offer critical insights into corporate performance amid a global economy marked by trade tensions, policy uncertainty, and persistent inflation risks. With global growth projected at approximately 3.3% for 2025, these earnings will serve as a barometer for corporate resilience and market trends. The global economic outlook for 2025 is characterized by cautious optimism. Growth is expected to hover around 3.3%, with advanced economies growing at 1.8% and emerging markets at 4.2%. However, risks are tilted to the downside due to escalating trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Inflation remains a concern, with services inflation slowing disinflation efforts, complicating monetary policy normalization. Central banks are likely to maintain higher interest rates, potentially impacting corporate profitability. Consumer sentiment is subdued, with only about 23% of Americans rating the economy positively, driven by concerns over rising food, housing, and energy costs. Against this backdrop, these earnings reports will reveal how companies are navigating these challenges. The technology sector is poised for robust growth in Q1 2025, fueled by advancements in AI, semiconductors, and data center solutions.

Title: Forbes Daily: Amid Hollywood Tariff Talk, Newsom Offers To Work With Trump

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. The family behind Skechers is set to pocket over $1 billion from selling the comfortable footwear brand. Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, which has previously invested in companies like Burger King and Tim Hortons, will spend nearly $9.5 billion to buy Skechers in a deal that will also take the company private. Robert Greenberg, a former hairstylist who tried to get rich off of everything from mail-order toupees to roller skates, founded the company with his son Michael in 1992 and the family still owns a 12% stake. The shoemaker reported a record $9 billion in revenue last year, though the deal comes in a precarious period for retailers amid tariffs. Nonetheless, 3G seems to be in it for the long haul. Ford pulled its annual financial forecast Monday. As President Donald Trump’s tariffs cause continued distress, Ford became the latest firm to pull its annual financial forecast Monday, in addition to truck engine maker Cummins. The automaker expects tariffs to reduce its earnings before interest and taxes by about $1.5 billion this year, and cited the “the potential for industrywide supply chain disruption.” Filming for some of the biggest blockbusters from this decade—from the Avatar franchise to Barbie—took place abroad, raising questions about the impacts of President Trump’s proposed 100% tariff on films produced outside the U.S. Film productions in the U.S. have declined in recent years, driven by the pandemic, labor strikes and financial incentives offered by locations abroad. MORE: California Governor Gavin Newsom said Monday that his home state was “all in to bring more production here” and that he wants to work with the Trump Administration to craft a $7.5 billion federal film tax incentive to support the entertainment industry, an alternative to the proposed tariffs. Warren Buffett's six-decade tenure as Berkshire Hathaway CEO will come to an end this year. Berkshire Hathaway and its iconic leader Warren Buffett saw a rare but predictable setback Monday, as the investment firm’s shares slid 5% on the first day of trading since Buffett announced he would step down as CEO at the end of 2025. Buffett’s fortune shrank by nearly $9 billion to about $160 billion amid the selloff, according to Forbes’ estimates. Alphabet’s Google has awarded Gamuda—a construction company cofounded by tycoon Lin Yun Ling—a contract worth $236 million to build a hyperscale data center in Malaysia. It’s the second deal Google has made with Gamuda, as Malaysia rapidly emerges as a key hub for data centers, with total investment commitments from major tech firms reaching more than $23 billion. A new bipartisan Senate bill would raise the limit on loans for small businesses in manufacturing from $5 million to $10 million, a needed increase on the Small Business Administration’s 15-year-old cap, but still a far cry from the $50 million limit proposed in Project 2025. ​​Bankers say the higher limit may help some manufacturers invest in equipment or expand facilities, but they don’t expect a flood of new factories due to President Donald Trump’s tariff uncertainty. The federal government will offer undocumented migrants $1,000 to leave the U.S., the Trump Administration’s latest effort to speed up its immigration agenda. The Department of Homeland Security estimates the program will decrease the cost of a deportation by 70%, down from an average of $17,121. Amid DOGE’s efforts to slash the federal workforce, the IRS has been a major target. The cuts have impacted 11% of its workforce, including those who voluntarily resigned and those who received termination notices—and more are on the way. Some positions were affected more than others, like revenue agents, who audit tax returns. Bills in the House and Senate aim to bring stablecoin issuers into the regulatory fold. Congress is racing to lay down the rules for stablecoins—blockchain-based tokens typically pegged to the U.S. dollar and, increasingly, the plumbing of global payments. Dueling bills in the House and Senate aim to bring stablecoin issuers into the regulatory fold, spelling out exactly how much capital, liquidity and risk management is enough. They also aim to clarify which federal or state agencies get to play referee. But there’s another, less flashy subplot: How will widespread acceptance of stablecoins among traditional institutions globally affect the $28 trillion U.S. Treasury market? Treasurys are the backbone of stablecoin reserves because not much else comes close in terms of safety and liquidity. If you’re offering a digital dollar, you need to back it with assets that are as close to risk-free as possible. This sounds a lot like hundreds of money market mutual funds, issued by giants like BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard, that hold over $6 trillion in assets—mostly in U.S. Treasury bills. But unlike a money market fund, stablecoin issuers have so far resisted offering any kind of yield or income to their holders. That’s one reason why Tether, the largest of them, has extremely high margins and reported over $1 billion in operating profit in the first quarter of 2025. Right now, the dozens of stablecoin issuers that exist hold about $150 billion in U.S. government debt. That’s a rounding error in the $28 trillion Treasury securities market and a fairly insignificant portion of the $6 trillion in Treasury bills outstanding. But Britain’s Standard Chartered Bank, which offers custody for cryptocurrencies, projects that the global stablecoin market could jump from $240 billion to $2 trillion in just three years. WHY IT MATTERS “The Trump Administration has argued that stablecoins could help secure the dollar’s global dominance, ensure higher demand for Treasurys and, in turn, lower U.S. borrowing costs,” says Forbes reporter Nina Bambysheva. “Still, some academics warn that embedding stablecoins into the Treasury market creates new vulnerabilities.” MORE Key Crypto Bill Imperiled By Trump Crypto Firm’s Deal With Emirati State-Owned Fund Shares of Netflix dipped after President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on foreign-produced movies. Still, the stock pared some of its losses after a White House spokesperson said no final decisions have been made: $20.4 billion: The market capitalization Netflix lost Monday morning 1.94%: The drop in Netflix stock at market close Monday 51%: The share of Netflix’s 2024 content budget that went to content sourced outside North America A key tenant of digital marketing from the last decade is shifting right before our eyes: Traditional search engine optimization, or SEO, is giving way to generative engine optimization, which is being referred to as “GEO.” For most businesses, the effects of ignoring GEO won’t be immediate—it will be a gradual decline in visibility and relevance.

Title: Why is Germany's Friedrich Merz, so unpopular with the public?

After some difficulty, Friedrich Merz has become Germany's new chancellor. His personal popularity is low. Most Germans don't trust him, not least because of his approach to the far-right AfD. Friedrich Merz has failed in his first attempt to become the Federal Republic's 10th chancellor on May 6, not garnering the necessary absolute majority of votes in the Bundestag. Only in round two did he manage to gather enough votes and become chancellor. This comes one day after his center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) signed their coalition agreement. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Even though he won the national election in late February, the 69-year-old's personal popularity has been on a permanent slide: According to an April poll by research institute Forsa for Stern magazine, just 21% of respondents consider Merz trustworthy — nine percentage points lower than in August, and down three points from January. The same poll found that only 40% of respondents consider the incoming chancellor a strong leader, and 27% think Merz "knows what moves people," both of which represent nine-point falls since January. On the plus side — indeed, the only leadership criteria in which Merz scored a majority in the survey — about 60% of respondents believe that Merz "speaks understandably." It's no shock that Merz isn't exactly the most popular chancellor-in-waiting Germany has ever seen. But Ursula Münch, the director of the Tutzing Academy for Political Education in Bavaria, told DW that it's not all his fault. "The circumstances are very different than they used to be," Münch said. "We have a government that has a relatively small proportion of support among voters." Merz has not picked the most fortunate moment in history: In traditional political parlance, a coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD is called a "grand coalition," because for many decades these two parties represented an overwhelming majority of Germany's voters (sometimes well over 80%). In the fragmented landscape of 2025, in which parties have splintered and splintered again over the past 20 years, the two big centrist parties can only claim to represent 45% of voters, going by the February election results. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video There are two obvious reasons why the perception of Merz's trustworthiness might have fallen in the past few months. In January, Merz broke his own word when he became the first CDU leader to pass a motion through the Bundestag with the support of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), whole factions of which are deemed by intelligence agencies to be a threat to Germany's democratic order. For CDU supporters, however, that seemed like a less-egregious U-turn than the one Merz performed a few weeks later: In March, the party leader agreed a debt brake reform with the SPD and the Greens that paved the way for €1 trillion ($1.14 trillion) in new loans, something he had expressly ruled out throughout the election campaign. Unsurprisingly, many of his voters felt betrayed. In a "Politbarometer" poll carried out by public broadcaster ZDF at the time, some 73% of Germans agreed that he had deceived voters — including some 44% of CDU/CSU supporters. Merz has problems that go much further back than his recent U-turns. Surveys have shown that he is particularly unpopular among women. A Forsa survey from March 2024 found that only 9% of women aged 18 to 29 saw Merz as their preferred chancellor candidate. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Merz has been dogged by accusations of misogyny. In 1997, as is often brought up, he was one of the Bundestag members who voted against recognizing rape within marriage as a crime. In October last year, he was criticized for rejecting the idea of gender-balanced Cabinets, and this reputation was not helped by a photo released in February showing that the main negotiators of the CDU/CSU bloc were all middle-aged men. Merz is also unpopular in eastern Germany, where he regularly polled behind both the AfD's Alice Weidel and the SPD's Olaf Scholz in the run-up to the election — partly, it seems, because of his belligerent attitude toward Russia. Merz's calculation appears to be that, with right-wing populism apparently on rise around the world, what people want is straight-talking leadership. But populism does not appear to be making him more popular. In November 2018, when he first announced his candidacy to re-take the leadership of the CDU, Merz posted a tweet that seems to age worse with every month: "We can once again reach up to 40% and halve the AfD. That is possible!" he wrote. "But we must create the preconditions for it. That is our task." Almost the opposite has happened. Since Merz eventually re-took the CDU leadership in January 2022 (on his third attempt), the party's poll ratings have stayed at 24%, while the AfD's have not halved but doubled: From 11% to 24%. Germany's far-right and center-right parties are now neck and neck. "The best way to keep the AfD small isn't making some random announcement about big changes in refugee policy that you can't implement," Münch said. "People need to be given confidence again, and that will only be possible when the economic forecast turns more positive and the refugee numbers fall." Merz was initially considered a strong candidate precisely because of his business background (he was on the board at the investment company BlackRock for several years), which was supposed to signal his economic acumen. In the past few years, however, his populist statements have increasingly been about immigration, and that hasn't helped him shake off the AfD.

High-speed trading giant Tower Research Capital has joined Citadel Securities in "bulking up its bets on cryptocurrencies," it was reported by Bloomberg, citing a leak from an anonymous source. One of Tower Research Capital’s trading groups has “increased capital allocation to its crypto trading book,” and upgraded its crypto market making infrastructure, the source told the financial newswire. Wall Street is quietly ramping up its support for bitcoin and crypto as the Trump administration promises to open up access to bitcoin trading and crypto markets, rolling back Biden-era restrictions and fast-tracking legislation that will rewire the financial system. Last week, Wall Street giants that manage a combined $10 trillion on behalf of clients are predicted to "open for business" on bitcoin this year, allowing advisors to recommend bitcoin ETFs to clients for the first time. The dozen U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, which rocketed to assets under management of more than $100 billion last year, pulled in almost $2 billion last week, according to data from SoSoValue, marking a return to growth after a recent period of outflows that mirrored the stock market’s volatility. “The flows are back in a big way,” BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, said during a recent bitcoin and crypto conference panel discussion, it was reported by The Block.

However, the market momentum seems to have fallen away over the last week, with the bitcoin price surge that propelled it to near $100,000 failing to carry it over the psychological barrier. “Bitcoin has rallied 25% over the past month, supported by aggressive ETF inflows and institutional spot buying,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of 10x Research, said in an emailed note, pointing to “weak funding rates” and “mounting” macro pressures as reason the bitcoin price rally may be fading. "A potential consolidation is forming near the $95,000 level as traders await new catalysts. This is not a time for blind risk-taking but tactical positioning with well-defined exposure."

Business U.S. meal delivery firm DoorDash will buy Deliveroo in a deal valuing the British rival at about 2.9 billion pounds ($3.85 billion), the companies said, banking on a bigger reach and local expertise to take on competition. Separately on Tuesday, DoorDash said it would buy SevenRooms, a New York City-based hospitality-related software company, for about $1.2 billion. The company's spending spree comes at a time when similar businesses have struggled to add scale with consumers being mindful about spending on pricey food delivery services. Both the companies rekindled talks last month after DoorDash approached Deliveroo with a 180 pence per share proposal, which was confirmed on Tuesday as the final offer, sending Deliveroo shares up about 2 per cent.

Large AI Overviews on SERPs are affecting visibility and causing a dramatic decrease in traffic. Effective faceted navigation can support SEO – if implemented correctly. Learn how to avoid index bloat, crawl issues, and ranking setbacks. This week’s question tackles the potential SEO fallouts when implementing faceted navigation: “How can ecommerce sites implement SEO-friendly faceted navigation without hurting crawl efficiency or creating index bloat?” Faceted navigation is a game-changer for user experience (UX) on large ecommerce sites. It helps users quickly narrow down what they’re looking for, whether it’s a size 8 pair of red road running trainers for women, or a blue, waterproof winter hiking jacket for men. For your customers, faceted navigation makes huge inventories feel manageable and, when done right, enhances both UX and SEO. However, when these facets create a new URL for every possible filter combination, they can lead to significant SEO issues that harm your rankings, and waste valuable crawl budget if not managed properly. Faceted navigation issues often fly under the radar – until they start causing real SEO damage. The good news? You don’t need to be a tech wizard to spot the early warning signs. With the right tools and a bit of detective work, you can uncover whether filters are bloating your site, wasting crawl budget, or diluting rankings. Here’s a step-by-step approach to auditing your site for faceted SEO issues: Start by searching on Google with this query: site:yourdomain.com. This will show you all the URLs Google has indexed for your site. Review the list: If so, you may have index bloat. Check Google Search Console (GSC) for a clearer picture. Look under “Coverage” to see how many pages are indexed. Pay attention to the “Indexed, not submitted in sitemap” section for unintended filter-generated pages. Not all faceted navigation behaves the same. Make sure you understand how filters work on your site: Some faceted pages drive traffic; others burn crawl budget without returns. Use tools like Botify, Screaming Frog, or Ahrefs to compare Googlebot’s crawling behavior with actual organic visits. If a page gets crawled a lot but doesn’t attract visitors, it’s a sign that it’s consuming crawl resources unnecessarily. Run a crawler to scan your site’s URLs. Check for repetitive patterns, such as endless combinations of parameters like ?price=low&sort=best-sellers. These are potential crawler traps and unnecessary variations. To decide which SEO tactics to use for faceted navigation, assess the search demand for specific filters and whether unique content can be created for those variations. Use keyword research tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ahrefs to check for user demand for specific filter combinations. For example: This helps prioritize which facet combinations should be indexed. If there’s enough value in targeting a specific query, such as product features, a dedicated URL may be worthwhile. However, low-value filters like price or size should remain no-indexed to avoid bloated indexing. The decision should balance the effort needed to create new URLs against the potential SEO benefits. Log files record every request, including those from search engine bots. By analyzing them, you can track which URLs Googlebot is crawling and how often, helping you identify wasted crawl budget on low-value pages. For example, if Googlebot is repeatedly crawling deep-filtered URLs like /jackets?size=large&brand=ASICS&price=100-200&page=12 with little traffic, that’s a red flag. Key signs of inefficiency include: By regularly checking your logs, you get a clear picture of Googlebot’s behavior, enabling you to optimize crawl budget and focus Googlebot’s attention on more valuable pages. Here’s how to keep things under control, so your site stays crawl-efficient and search-friendly. Start with the basics: Your facet labels should be intuitive. “Blue,” “Leather,” “Under £200” – these need to make instant sense to your users. Confusing or overly technical terms can lead to a frustrating experience and missed conversions. Not sure what resonates? Check out competitor sites and see how they’re labeling similar filters. Just because you can add 30 different filters doesn’t mean you should. Too many options can overwhelm users and generate thousands of unnecessary URL combinations. Stick to what genuinely helps customers narrow down their search. If your platform allows it, use clean, readable URLs for facets like /sofas/blue rather than messy query strings like ?color[blue]. Reserve query parameters for optional filters (e.g., sort order or availability), and don’t index those. Use canonical tags to point similar or filtered pages back to the main category/parent page. This helps consolidate link equity and avoid duplicate content issues. Just remember, canonical tags are suggestions, not commands. Google may ignore them if your filtered pages appear too different or are heavily linked internally. For any faceted pages you want indexed, these should include a self-referencing canonical, and for any that don’t, canonicalize these to the parent page. Break your URLs into three clear groups: No matter the order in which users apply filters, the resulting URL should be consistent. For example, /trainers/blue/leather and /trainers/leather/blue should result in the same URL, or else you’ll end up with duplicate content that dilutes SEO value. One way to reduce unnecessary crawling is by blocking faceted URLs through your robots.txt file. That said, it’s important to know that robots.txt is more of a polite request than a strict rule. Search engines like Google typically respect it, but not all bots do, and some may interpret the syntax differently. To prevent search engines from crawling pages you don’t want indexed, it’s also smart to ensure those pages aren’t linked to internally or externally (e.g., backlinks). If search engines find value in those pages through links, they might still crawl or index them, even with a disallow rule in place. Here’s a basic example of how to block a faceted URL pattern using the robots.txt file. Suppose you want to stop crawlers from accessing URLs that include a color parameter: User-agent: * Disallow: /*color* In this rule: However, if your faceted navigation requires a more nuanced approach, such as blocking most color options but allowing specific ones, you’ll need to mix Disallow and Allow rules. For instance, to block all color parameters except for “black,” your file might include: User-agent: * Disallow: /*color* Allow: /*color=black* A word of caution: This strategy only works well if your URLs follow a consistent structure. Without clear patterns, it becomes harder to manage, and you risk accidentally blocking key pages or leaving unwanted URLs crawlable. If you’re working with complex URLs or an inconsistent setup, consider combining this with other techniques like meta noindex tags or parameter handling in Google Search Console. Internal links signal importance to search engines. So, if you link frequently to faceted URLs that are canonicalized or blocked, you’re sending mixed signals. Consider using rel=”nofollow” on links you don’t want crawled – but be cautious. Google treats nofollow as a hint, not a rule, so results may vary. Point to only canonical URLs within your website wherever possible. This includes dropping parameters and slugs from links that are not necessary for your URLs to work. You should also prioritize pillar pages; the more inlinks a page has, the more authoritative search engines will deem that page to be. In 2019, Google’s John Mueller said: “In general, we ignore everything after hash… So things like links to the site and the indexing, all of that will be based on the non hash URL. And if there are any links to the hashed URL, then we will fold up into the non hash URL.” Track which filters users actually engage with, and which lead to conversions. If no one ever uses the “beige” filter, it may not deserve crawlable status. Use tools like Google Analytics 4 or Hotjar to see what users care about and streamline your navigation accordingly. When a filtered page returns no results, respond with a 404 status, unless it’s a temporary out-of-stock issue, in which case show a friendly message stating so, and return a 200. This helps avoid wasting crawl budget on thin content. When you interact with a page – say, filtering a product list, selecting a color, or typing in a live search box – AJAX lets the site fetch or send data behind the scenes, so the rest of the page stays put. It can be really effective to implement facets client-side via AJAX, which doesn’t create multiple URLs for every filter change. This reduces unnecessary load on the server and improves performance. Faceted navigation often leads to large sets of results, which naturally introduces pagination (e.g., ?category=shoes&page=2). But when combined with layered filters, these paginated URLs can balloon into thousands of crawlable variations. Left unchecked, this can create serious crawl and index bloat, wasting search engine resources on near-duplicate pages. So, should paginated URLs be indexed? In most cases, no. Pages beyond the first page rarely offer unique value or attract meaningful traffic, so it’s best to prevent them from being indexed while still allowing crawlers to follow links. The standard approach here is to use noindex, follow on all pages after page 1. This ensures your deeper pagination doesn’t get indexed, but search engines can still discover products via internal links. When it comes to canonical tags, you’ve got two options depending on the content. If pages 2, 3, and so on are simply continuations of the same result set, it makes sense to canonicalize them to page 1. This consolidates ranking signals and avoids duplication. However, if each paginated page features distinct content or meaningful differences, a self-referencing canonical might be the better fit. The key is consistency – don’t mix page 2 canonical to page 1 and page 3 to itself, for example. About rel=”next” and rel=”prev,” while Google no longer uses these signals for indexing, they still offer UX benefits and remain valid HTML markup. They also help communicate page flow to accessibility tools and browsers, so there’s no harm in including them. To help control crawl depth, especially in large ecommerce sites, it’s wise to combine pagination handling with other crawl management tactics: For example, a faceted URL like /trainers?color=white&brand=asics&page=3 would typically: Handling pagination well is just as important as managing the filters themselves. It’s all part of keeping your site lean, crawlable, and search-friendly. When properly managed, faceted navigation can be an invaluable tool for improving user experience, targeting long-tail keywords, and boosting conversions. However, without the right SEO strategy in place, it can quickly turn into a crawl efficiency nightmare that damages your rankings. By following the best practices outlined above, you can enjoy all the benefits of faceted navigation while avoiding the common pitfalls that often trip up ecommerce sites.

Title: Why Stablecoin Issuers Could Displace Japan And China As The Biggest Buyers Of U.S. Treasury Securities

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Staff Writer, Money & Markets ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Brian Moynihan, the chief executive officer of $2.6 trillion (assets) Bank of America, doesn’t usually make headlines for his crypto opinions. But in February, he did just that: “If they make that legal, we’ll go into that business.” He was talking about stablecoins—blockchain-based tokens typically pegged to the U.S. dollar and, increasingly, the plumbing of global payments. “They” are Congress, which is now racing to lay down the rules of the road for these crypto creations. The STABLE Act in the House and the GENIUS Act in the Senate are dueling bills with a common goal: to bring stablecoin issuers into the regulatory fold, spelling out exactly how much capital, liquidity and risk management is enough. They also aim to clarify which federal or state agencies get to play referee. But there’s another, less flashy subplot: how will widespread acceptance of stablecoins among traditional institutions globally affect the $28 trillion United States Treasury market? Here’s the thing: Treasurys are the backbone of stablecoin reserves because not much else comes close in terms of safety and liquidity. If you’re offering a digital dollar, you need to back it with assets that are as close to risk-free as possible. This sounds a lot like hundreds of money market mutual funds, which are issued by giants like BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard and hold over $6 trillion in assets, mostly in U.S. Treasury bills. The big difference is that unlike a money market fund, say, from Fidelity, which might pay you an annual yield of 4%, most stablecoin issuers have so far resisted offering any kind of yield or income to their holders. That’s one reason why Tether, the largest of them, has extremely high margins and reported over $1 billion in operating profit in the first quarter of 2025. Right now, the dozens of stablecoin issuers that exist—though mostly Tether, based in El Salvador, and Circle, headquartered in New York—hold an estimated $150 billion in U.S. government debt, primarily short-term T-bills. That’s a rounding error in the $28 trillion Treasury securities market and a fairly insignificant portion of the $6 trillion in Treasury bills outstanding. Most Treasurys are still held by the U.S. government itself, think Social Security and federal pension funds. U.S. mutual funds, banks and insurance companies are the next biggest holders, with foreign investors accounting for about 30% (roughly $8.8 trillion), led by Japan and China. But Britain’s Standard Chartered Bank, an $874 billion (assets) institution that offers custody for cryptocurrencies, projects that the global stablecoin market could jump from $240 billion to $2 trillion in just three years. Both current drafts of the stablecoin bills explicitly identify Treasury securities with maturities of 93 days or less as one of the few acceptable reserves. That could mean an extra $1 trillion in demand for T-bills in the near term, according to an April 30 presentation by the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC), a group of senior bankers, asset managers and hedge fund representatives that advises Treasury officials each quarter. Citi’s research team goes further, suggesting that by 2030 stablecoin issuers could surpass any single foreign country as holders of U.S. government debt. Despite its controversial history, Tether, with $120 billion invested in U.S. Treasurys already, could become the largest holder if it falls into compliance with new regulations. Citi This market upheaval could unfold as the U.S. national debt climbs past $36 trillion, swelling by another trillion roughly every 176 days. Meanwhile, creditors like China and Saudi Arabia are quietly trimming their Treasury holdings. China’s dropped to $761 billion earlier this year, its lowest since 2009, while Saudi Arabia’s have fallen to a year-and-a-half low of $126 billion, reflecting a global rebalancing of reserves and rising skepticism about U.S. sovereign debt. Enter crypto users around the world, in places like Buenos Aires and Nairobi, using stablecoins for everything from paying their rent to hedging against local currency volatility and simultaneously stepping up as a new, eager class of lenders to Uncle Sam. The Trump administration has already made its stance on stablecoins clear. Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks has argued that they could help secure the dollar’s global dominance, and President Trump has pressed Congress to get a bill to his desk before the August recess. “Stablecoins have the potential to ensure American dollar dominance internationally to increase the usage of the U.S. dollar digitally as the world’s reserve currency, and in the process create potentially trillions of dollars of demand for U.S. Treasuries, which could lower long-term interest rates,” said Sacks during his first press conference in February. Additionally, the Trump family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, announced plans for its own stablecoin, which is now apparently complicating the fate of pending regulation. On May 1, World Liberty announced that the token would be used by MGX, an Abu Dhabi government-backed firm, to invest $2 billion into Binance, the crypto exchange whose founder is reportedly seeking a presidential pardon. A couple of days later, nine Senate Democrats, including four who previously backed the stablecoin “GENIUS” bill, issued a statement saying they would oppose the legislation in its current form, Politico reported. But lawmakers had been promoting the idea of stablecoin issuers as ultimate Treasurys buyers even before Trump took office. Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York wrote last fall that more stablecoin adoption means higher demand for Treasurys and, in turn, lower U.S. borrowing costs. Earlier, former House Speaker Paul Ryan floated stablecoins as a buffer against a future wave of foreign selling: if traditional buyers retreat, dollar-backed token issuers could fill the gap. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, puts it bluntly: “You couldn’t invent a better innovation for the U.S. dollar than a stablecoin. It makes the dollar more available globally. It reinforces it as the global reserve currency. If it gets into the wrong hands, there's due process by which the government can freeze and seize assets. It checks so many boxes: creates buyers for your debt, brings your interest rates lower.” Yesha Yadav, a professor at Vanderbilt University whose research focuses on the Treasury market, is decidedly less enthusiastic about a crypto takeover of the government securities market. She believes that embedding stablecoins into it creates new vulnerabilities. “If the U.S. Treasury market becomes, for whatever reason, stressed, if there are doubts about the U.S.’s ability to make good on its payments, then for stablecoin issuers, it's no longer a safe asset that can substitute as a money claim,” she explains. And if a major stablecoin issuer collapses, it could be forced to dump Treasurys en masse, destabilizing the market. Unlike foreign central banks, stablecoin issuers face genuine run risk: panicked customers can pull funds instantly, triggering immediate selling pressure. Of course, this risk applies to money market funds as well. In 2008, after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the $65 billion Reserve Primary Fund, which held less than 2% of Lehman’s commercial paper, experienced a run and “broke the buck”, forcing it to liquidate its assets. “For the first time, the Treasury market is supporting the moneyness of a payment system by becoming a backstop of an entirely new monetary claim,” Yadav notes. If a crisis hits, will the government have to bail out stablecoin issuers to honor the dollar claims they’ve issued? Policymakers haven’t fully grappled with these questions, and they should, she says. Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at the George Washington University, raises another concern: “The creation of major new demands for Treasury bills and Treasury-backed repos and reverse repos by stablecoin issuers could cause dangerous shortages of available Treasury bills, particularly during periods of financial stress.” He points to past disruptions like the repo market crisis of September 2019 and the “dash for cash” in March 2020 as cautionary tales. For now, another trillion dollars in Treasury demand from stablecoin issuers might seem manageable. But the landscape is shifting fast. Major financial institutions like Bank of America and Fidelity, which manage trillions in assets, are eyeing stablecoin launches. Visa and Stripe-acquired Bridge just rolled out stablecoin-linked cards across Latin America, and Mastercard unveiled a new platform through which users will be able to pay for purchases with stablecoins and withdraw them directly into their bank accounts. Still, Yadav cautions anyone thinking that stablecoins will become a reliable backstop for the U.S. dollar or the Treasury market: “The presumption that stablecoin issuers will simply fill the gap, is not something that policymakers should be counting on,” she warns. And there’s another potential risk: will banks and other stablecoin issuers limit their reserves to Treasurys? Kevin Lehtiniitty, CEO of Borderless.xyz, believes bank-issued stablecoins could become subject to the fractional reserve rules that banks have long used to turn their FDIC-insured deposits into more lucrative growth areas. Perhaps, commercial real estate, subprime mortgages, DeFi? Stay tuned.

Title: Meta's layoffs were supposed to target low performers. These employees share how it felt to them.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-low-performance-cuts-review-cycle-politics-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-05-06T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
Months after Meta's high-profile culling of low performers, the stigma associated with the job cuts still stings. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's push to "raise the bar on performance" saw about 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — laid off in a sweeping round of cuts in February. The company said it targeted its lowest performers, but some former employees pushed back on that. Some said they had received positive ratings months earlier. Others said they were on medical or parental leave, mid-transfer between teams, or hadn't received a formal rating yet. Some speculated that conflict with a manager was the deciding factor. As of late April, laid-off employees received severance payouts. The eight accounts below offer a sense of how employees who were let go experienced the cuts and their concern about how it could affect their futures. BI has verified the performance records of these ex-workers, who asked for anonymity because they fear the "low performer" label could hurt future job prospects. A Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI earlier this year about its low-performer cuts: "Let me be clear, these were performance-based terminations," the spokesperson said. "Prior ratings were not downgraded. Simply because someone had a history of meeting or exceeding expectations does not mean they continue to consistently meet the bar." The spokesperson added that Meta employees are held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance. A former employee in Meta's human resources division had returned to work after being on parental leave for nearly five months when his division lost close to 10% of its staff. His midyear review put him "At or Above Expectations" — the middle tier — but his year-end rating was "Meets Most," which made him eligible for termination. "I tried calling my boss immediately, but in my heart, I knew it probably wasn't an error — Meta wouldn't make a mistake that significant." He said the manager was distressed but repeated: "I can't say anything. It's just part of Mark's mandate. It's a hard year." He said he didn't know why his rating had fallen. "We can't even see the feedback our managers wrote for us," he said. "Once the shock wore off, there was actually a mix of emotions — including some relief at being freed from that situation." But he does worry about carrying the low-performer label. "It's one thing to be let go in a restructuring," he said. "It's another to have your professional reputation potentially damaged by being mischaracterized as an underperformer." A former senior machine learning engineer at Meta described the shock of being laid off, only for a Meta recruiter to invite her to reapply three days later and skip the interview process. "Same email address. Same person. No acknowledgment of what had just happened. It felt surreal," she said. She said she joined Meta in early 2024 and earned a midyear review of "At or Above Expectations." Initially rated "Meets All Expectations" in the January 2025 year-end review, she was downgraded to "Meets Most Expectations" after a second round of director-level reviews. She said she suspects "directors were under pressure to hit a layoff quota." Before the layoff, she was dissatisfied with her manager and sought a transfer to a top-tier team. It was approved, but she was told the move could lower her rating, so she waited — only to be pink-slipped. She said she's not taking the recruiter up on her offer. Ultimately, she's confident she can land or create her next opportunity. "I'll be fine. I can get another job or start something of my own." This software engineer who joined Meta in May 2024 to work on cross-platform content sharing said a promising start unraveled because of internal politics over a new feature he prototyped. He said he took a four-month leave for burnout in August and returned in December to complete two more projects. Two weeks before the layoffs, he said, his new manager told the team everyone was "safe." Then came the termination email — and a performance rating of "Meets Some Expectations," low on Meta's end-of-year rating scale. "How could they evaluate my performance when I'd only worked 10 weeks in 2024?" he said, adding that an HR director had said he was "too new to evaluate." Although he's now fielding interest from other companies and expects to receive 16 weeks of severance, he still feels the sting of his rating. "The harmful 'low performer' label still feels wrong," he said. This product manager joined Facebook as a contractor in 2018, converted to full time in 2020, and consistently received a year-end "Greatly Exceeds Expectations" ratings label. In 2023, when she moved to Reality Labs, "everything changed," she said. "My manager would call late at night to question my capabilities and create doubt, even though teammates gave me positive feedback," she said. A review in early 2024 dropped her two tiers to "Meets All Expectations." Feedback included accusations that she was "blinded" by a "desire for promotion," she said. In August, she took a 12-week disability leave "because I was physically ill from all the stress." She returned in November and was laid off in February. She's being "selective" in her hunt for a new job. "The experience damaged my health, affected my family, and forced me onto medication for anxiety. I need to walk away from toxicity at the first sign, not wait until it affects my health and family again." A technical program manager was laid off after seven years of good performance ratings at Meta. A reorganization placed her under a new manager a few months earlier — a shift she felt exposed her. "When managers have to meet quotas and choose someone to cut, people with less history on the team are at higher risk," she said. "I contacted my manager in shock" after the termination notice, she said. "I just wanted five minutes to talk to ensure I wasn't going crazy." The manager responded with a templated email — the same company-approved language she had been required to use the day before when laying off her own direct report. She still doesn't know exactly what led to their selection. "Was it because I had significant equity vested when the stock price was low?" she said. " Was it because I expressed disappointment about Meta rolling back DEI programs on internal forums? I'll never know — but there's clearly more to this story than simply cutting the lowest performers." After 14 years at Google and three at Meta, a program manager said she was laid off despite a strong performance record: "At Meta, I'd even received 'Exceeds Expectations' and the rare 'Redefines Expectations.'" She said her manager told her she was doing "a great job" at the midyear review. "I was candid with my manager — sometimes critically, but always constructively — about where I thought things could improve," she said. "I was transparent about how stress in my personal life was affecting me: My husband had been laid off, and we were caring for a special-needs child." She said her manager told her not to worry, but she'd noticed a shift in tone at Meta — for example, when chief technology officer Andrew "Boz" Bosworth said a worker who alleged mistreatment should just quit. "The compassionate tone of the 2022 layoffs — the regret, the messaging about hard decisions — feels like a distant memory," she said. "This round was cutthroat. Silent. Cold. 'The Hunger Games,' but for high performers." "I wrote a final email to my skip-level manager," she added. "Not to get my job back. Not even to get a reply (I didn't). I just wanted to be heard. To say: I know I did good work. I know I didn't deserve this. And I hope someone — anyone — in leadership still has the humanity to care." This employee spent years working on critical internal systems. In the days before the layoffs, he focused on ensuring everything would run smoothly. He had received consistently strong performance ratings and said his managers agreed he was on track, but his termination letter assigned him a "Meets Most Expectations" rating. He said his managers didn't look at the self-review he submitted. "That told me everything. This wasn't about performance," he said. "This was about filling quotas." The manager expressed support for the decision, but said there were constraints around time and communication. In his view, the company culture had grown increasingly cutthroat, with employees clinging to projects to boost their ratings, jockeying within the performance curve, and seeing dissent increasingly punished. "Many people stay because the compensation is hard to walk away from, not because they believe in the mission. I was one of them. It was a place that offered scale and learning, but at a steep emotional cost," he said, adding that his healthy salary would have made him "an easy target" for cost-cutters. An engineer was laid off after five months of leave for a serious health crisis while in the middle of disability-related negotiations. He said his final performance rating — "Meets Most Expectations" — felt like "a scarlet letter." "I wasn't underperforming," he said. Peer reviews before the leave had been entirely positive, and he saved "screenshots of it all for my lawyer." His compensation exceeded $500,000, making him the highest-paid person on the team after his manager. He said he worked 60 to 75 hours before falling ill, but he sensed resentment after raising burnout concerns and stepping away from a major project. "And after the layoff? Nothing. My manager didn't even say goodbye." He said Meta's branding of laid-off workers as low performers "sets a dangerous precedent — companies can quietly rewrite the story of your career, and you don't get to fight back." He's exploring legal options. "Meta is telling one story," he said. "And for many of us, it's not the truth." Have a tip?

Title: UK's Deliveroo to be bought by US firm DoorDash for £2.9bn

Deliveroo, the food delivery app, has agreed to be taken over by US giant DoorDash in a deal valuing the business at £2.9bn. The combined company will have a presence in more than 40 countries serving about 50 million customers per month. The tie-up is also expected to provide fierce competition to rivals Just Eat and Uber Eats in the UK. However, the deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US firm, fuelling further concerns over UK investment. DoorDash is offering 180p per Deliveroo share, which marks a 44% increase on the UK company's share price from the point when takeover talks were made public last month. However, it is well below the 390p share price that Deliveroo first floated at when it launched on the London Stock Exchange in April 2021. "The combination with Deliveroo will strengthen DoorDash's position as a leading global platform in local commerce," the two firms said. Will Shu, chief executive and co-founder of Deliveroo, said he was "very proud of everything we have achieved as a standalone business". However, he said the deal with DoorDash, which is based in San Francisco, was "transformative". "The enlarged group will have the scale to invest in product, technology and the overall consumer value proposition." The takeover is to be put forward to shareholders for final approval. Mr Shu, is set to receive about £172.4m for his 6.4% stake. Deliveroo, which was co-founded by Mr Shu in 2013, operates in nine countries with more 130,000 delivery riders. It provides a food delivery service by linking restaurants with customers through an app. It also supplies groceries. It made sales of about £2bn in 2024, while DoorDash, which was set up in the same year, made some £8bn last year through its operations in more than 30 countries. The companies both started out as food delivery services, offering customers convenient and quick access to a range of restaurants and takeaways, but DoorDash has grown into a much bigger business. DoorDash has seen its value soar after listing in the US, compared to Deliveroo, which has been listed in the UK. The takeover raises further questions for the London Stock Exchange, which has lost another big name to a US company. As well as takeovers, UK-listed firms worth hundreds of billions of pounds have been quitting the London Stock Exchange for the US over the past few years, prompting concerns over how attractive the UK is for investment. These include Cambridge-based microchip giant Arm Holdings, which now sells its shares in New York, Paddy Power's owner Flutter and equipment hire giant Ashtead. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, previously told the BBC that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing. News of a potential agreement between the firms emerged just over a week ago, and sent Deliveroo's share price up sharply. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said DoorDash was aiming to "squeeze out" rivals such as Just Eat and "rattle Uber" in the UK. "The deal, expected to close later this year, could turn the UK market into a fierce two-horse race with DoorDash and Uber at the top," he added. "With no competing bid in sight, this looks like a bold, calculated move to outpace global rivals and gain ground fast." The takeover by a US firm shows the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. Oury Amadou Diallo, 22, did not have licence for modified bike classed as motorcycle, court hears. David Nicholson rents a school kitchen out of hours and cooks meals that are sold on Deliveroo app. Councillors say action is needed from companies to avoid the safety risks being posed to shoppers. Illegally converted bikes are linked to fires while charging, often overnight in users' homes. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Title: Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms

The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at £2.9bn and will create a company with operations in more than 40 countries. While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years. Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens. Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items – like nappies, flowers and pet food. Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time – Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange. But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much. This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value – its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets. Let's look at another measure – the price of each share. An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%. An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%. What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival – just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets. This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing. There are many reasons. Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half. How can there be such a huge disparity? Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies – the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings – still a massive premium to the UK. One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand. UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled. Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds. But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets – and they have been dead right. In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%. But there are changes afoot. The government's so-called "Edinburgh Reforms", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others. There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan. They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year. The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market. Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had "no immediate" plans to move, he and his company "got a very warm welcome" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it. What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals. Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here. Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate. Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract. The deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US rival. Oury Amadou Diallo, 22, did not have licence for modified bike classed as motorcycle, court hears. David Nicholson rents a school kitchen out of hours and cooks meals that are sold on Deliveroo app. Councillors say action is needed from companies to avoid the safety risks being posed to shoppers.

Title: DoorDash agrees to buy Deliveroo in $3.9bn deal
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/05/06/doordash-agrees-to-buy-deliveroo-in-39bn-deal/
Time Published: 2025-05-06T07:32:27Z

DoorDash has agreed to buy UK-based food-delivery platform Deliveroo for an equity value of about £2.9 billion (€3.4 billion), as the US company pushes into more overseas markets. DoorDash has offered £1.80 in cash for each Deliveroo share, the company said in a statement on Tuesday, confirming the terms of an offer announced on April 25th. That’s a 29 per cent premium to Deliveroo’s closing share price on April 24. The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. DoorDash, which controls two-thirds of the restaurant delivery market in the US, will expand its reach to more than 40 countries with the acquisition, it said. The two companies combined had a gross order value of about $90 billion last year and have a combined 50 million monthly active users. Deliveroo shares closed at £172.10 on Friday in trading in London, where markets were closed on Monday. The stock is up 21 per cent this year. DoorDash’s shares also advanced, closing at $205.40 on Monday, taking gains for the year to 22 per cent. DoorDash said that its offer is final and won’t be increased unless another bidder comes in for the UK company. Previous negotiations had ended in disagreement over Deliveroo’s valuation, Reuters reported last year. DoorDash, which provides a restaurant delivery service through a mobile application, said it would not increase its offer, but reserved a right to do so if a third party emerged with a competing offer for Deliveroo. The acquisition will help Doordash grow its market share in Europe, competing against Just Eat and Uber Eats. Britain and Ireland are Deliveroo’s largest market, accounting for 62% of the value of its orders in its latest quarter. Deliveroo’s directors, including chief executive officer Will Shu, have agreed to offer their shares in the deal, and DoorDash said it has agreements from investors representing 15.4 per cent of the stock so far. The deal needs the approval of owners representing 75 per cent of Deliveroo’s shares. The proposal is the latest example of consolidation in the industry, after Prosus in February agreed to buy Amsterdam’s Just Eat Takeaway. Food delivery companies are being pushed to combine after rapid acceleration during the Covid-19 pandemic lost steam in the years following. A new generation of global players with deep pockets are now competing for customers across borders. Deliveroo shares dropped in March after projecting earnings that fell far below analysts’ estimates, and the company exited the Hong Kong market, following disappointing sales and mounting competition. - Reporting: Bloomberg/Reuters Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: WPP Prepares to Kill Off GroupM Name to Make Way for WPP Media

We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters. WPP is set to retire its GroupM brand, which houses its media agencies, renaming it WPP Media, per several industry reports. ADWEEK also learned of the decision to sunset the 20-year-old name from a source with knowledge of the matter. A WPP spokesperson told ADWEEK: “We don’t comment on speculation.” Switching out the 20-year-old name is set to occur before summer, and follows what WPP chief executive (CEO) Mark Read described in the company’s annual report as a “year of transition” for the media investment division under new CEO Brian Lesser, who joined in September 2024. GroupM employs around 40,000 people, more than a third of WPP’s total global workforce. Ad Age reported that there will be layoffs as part of the process, related to the consolidation of individual media agency teams. WPP declined to comment on any reduction in staff. Just now, GroupM operates with a core group of four global agencies: Mindshare, Wavemaker, EssenceMediacom, and T&Pm. It also offers cross-channel performance via GroupM Nexus, data solutions through Choreograph, and entertainment services via GroupM Motion Entertainment. Per WPP’s website, GroupM manages $63 billion worth of media budgets. Major clients include Amazon and Unilever. Coca-Cola is also a key account, however WPP recently lost the soda giant’s North American media business to rival Publicis Groupe. Lesser revamped GroupM’s leadership restructure in January 2025, axing global CEO positions for individual agencies and naming McKinsey & Company’s Emily Del Greco global chief operating officer (COO). Read recently told ADWEEK that GroupM was a key player in WPP’s turnaround plan as it posted a 5% Q1 2025 revenue dip amid ongoing financial struggles. Year-on-year revenue declined at GroupM for the quarter too, with growth in the U.S. offset by client losses from “previous years” and weakness in China. “At its best, GroupM is extremely competitive. We just need to make sure they’re on their best every day of the week,” Read said at the end of April. Mark Read is Still Banking on a GroupM Turnaround The CEO’s six-year tenure at WPP has been marked by consolidation to cut operating costs. One big change on the creative side involved bringing together VML and Y&R with Wunderman Thomson under the VML brand. On the media side, Read merged digital media agency Essence and media buying firm Mediacom to form EssenceMediacom. He also merged five of WPP’s branding and design agencies into Superunion, which was then combined with Design Bridge to create Design Bridge and Partners. Rebecca is Adweek's Europe brand editor.

The expansion brings Spark’s total value locked (TVL) to $2.4 billion, making it the leading on-chain allocator, per DeFiLlama data. The allocation follows the conclusion of Spark’s "Tokenization Grand Prix," a months-long initiative that awarded capital to three RWA protocols: BlackRock/Securitize’s BUIDL, Superstate’s USTB, and Centrifuge-Anemoy’s JTRSY. “The expanded capital base comes at a time of growing institutional and retail momentum in onchain finance, particularly across Asia Pacific and emerging markets,” the platform shared in a statement with Decrypt. The initial $1 billion allocation, finalized following a Sky governance vote on April 3, deployed $500 million to BUIDL, $300 million to USTB, and $200 million to JTRSY. Spark’s Liquidity Layer automates liquidity provision for USDC, among other stablecoins, directly from Sky across various networks and protocols. The new funds are being distributed to the same recipients as Spark’s original $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix. The latest allocation offers a clearer picture of how tokenized RWAs, primarily short-term U.S. Treasuries, are being actively adopted as primary reserves by major DeFi protocols seeking to stabilize yields and reduce exposure to crypto-native volatility. The Tokenization Grand Prix, launched in July 2024, was an open call for asset issuers to propose RWA products for Spark’s stablecoin-backed treasury. Thirty-nine applications were reviewed by Steakhouse Financial, a firm embedded in the Spark ecosystem with experience underwriting RWA protocols. Evaluations focused on liquidity, pricing transparency, and alignment with Spark’s goal of integrating low-volatility, yield-generating assets into DeFi. The assets were onboarded via the Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL), which holds stablecoins including USDC, USDS, sUSDS, USDe, and sUSDe. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund holds approximately $2.81 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, making it the largest among the three. Superstate’s USTB follows with $490.7 million, while Centrifuge’s JTRSY stands at $237.1 million, according to DeFiLlama data. All three funds are backed by short-duration government debt and structured to reinvest as securities mature. Spark’s role within Sky, a rebranded MakerDAO, has grown since the governance overhaul was announced in August 2024. Now operating as a standalone “Star” (Sky’s designation for modular sub-protocols), Spark has reported around $40 million in revenue in Q1 2025 and launched a USDC Savings Vault, which has attracted more than $41 million in deposits, according to the protocol. The protocol also expanded to Arbitrum and Base earlier this year. While many DeFi protocols have explored exposure to sovereign debt, Spark’s combined $2.4 billion deployment places it ahead of peers. RWA.xyz data shows that total tokenized U.S. Treasury assets across protocols now exceed $3.5 billion, meaning Spark alone accounts for more than two-thirds of the current market.

Title: Conservative Leader Friedrich Merz Set To Become Germany's Chancellor
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/conservative-leader-friedrich-merz-set-to-become-germanys-chancellor-8341776
Time Published: 2025-05-06T06:08:39Z
Full Content:
Conservative Friedrich Merz is set to be sworn in on Tuesday as Germany's new chancellor at a critical juncture as the economy battles its longest post-war downturn, relations with top security ally the United States fray and the far-right surges. Lawmakers are widely expected to back Merz as chancellor in a vote in the lower house of parliament after his CDU/CSU conservatives, who won February's federal election, secured a coalition deal with the centre-left Social Democrats. The pressure is on for Merz to show leadership after the implosion last November of outgoing SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-way coalition left a political vacuum at the heart of Europe, even as it faced a myriad of crises. "People have been asking Germany to lead for a long time, and there is no more space to not heed that call," said Sudha David-Wilp of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. "Everything that had been undergirding post-war Germany in the past eight decades is no longer the case, whether it be open markets and free trade, whether it be the U.S. security presence in Europe." A global trade war sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping import tariffs is threatening a third year of downturn in Europe's largest economy, which has already had to grapple with the end of cheap Russian gas since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and growing rivalry from China. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened not to come to the aid of fellow members of the NATO defence alliance, prompting even transatlanticist Merz to question the reliability of the United States and urge Europe to improve its ability to defend itself. The German coalition deal has mapped out plans to revive growth such as reducing a corporate tax and lowering energy prices. It also vows strong support for Ukraine and higher military spending. While Merz is a veteran politician who started his career as a European lawmaker in the 1980s, he still has to prove his chops in power as he has never held a government office. After losing a power struggle to arch party rival Angela Merkel in 2002, he spent over a decade working in the private sector before finding his way back into top level politics. A wealthy, Catholic west German lawyer and hobby pilot who served for four years as chairman of the German arm of fund manager BlackRock, Merz is widely considered the antithesis in both style and policy to the woman who led Germany for 16 years. Where Merkel was an even-tempered pragmatist who shifted the conservatives more towards the centre, Merz is a provocative economic liberal who has pulled the bloc back to the right. Merz's supporters highlight the fact he secured a historic fiscal package to boost spending on infrastructure and defence even before taking office. Critics say it was only necessary because of his erratic decision to push an anti-migration motion through parliament with the backing of the Alternative for Germany, breaking a taboo on cooperation with the far-right. That decision boosted support for both the AfD and the far-left Left party, who together secured enough support to be able to block a loosening of Germany's fiscal rules in the next parliament. "Merz remains a black box," said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. "The U-turn on fiscal policies, as much needed as it was, still begs the question why Merz ruled it out during the elections, and does he really have a longer-term vision on the economy?" With the AfD topping some recent polls, the new government's main challenge is clearly to restore confidence and trust in Germany's political centre, said Brzeski. "If this government fails, the AfD will get more support in the next elections and could become part of any next government," he said. Merz's designated cabinet reflects a belief in the need for expertise over political capital and a desire for renewal given the declining trust in the establishment, say analysts. Only one minister from the previous government will retain his position: Defence Minister Boris Pistorius. The rest of the cabinet are new appointees, many of them like the economy minister with private sector experience in the area they will now be governing.

Title: ‘It’s a stunning setting for any cafe, but this one has extra-special credentials’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/health/your-wellness/2025/05/06/its-a-stunning-setting-for-any-cafe-but-this-one-has-extra-special-credentials/

There is a palpable sense of purpose and job satisfaction among the young adults with Down syndrome who work in the Happy Out cafe in Dún Laoghaire. We are chatting on the outdoor terrace of the cafe in the refurbished Dún Laoghaire Baths building overlooking the harbour. It’s a stunning setting for any cafe, but this one has extra-special credentials because it may be the first commercial cafe in Ireland to employ adults with Down syndrome in partnership with a social enterprise. “I don’t have anyone in my family with Down syndrome, but this opportunity fell into my lap and I thought it would be very nice to do,” says Brian Hanratty, who owns Happy Out cafes on Bull Island and in Donnybrook as well as Dún Laoghaire. Hanratty first came in contact with the Together Academy social enterprise – which trains and finds work for adults with Down syndrome – at its base in the Wanderers Football Club a few years ago. “I helped them set up their coffee shop in the bar at Wanderers and trained them how to make coffee,” Hanratty explains. The Together Academy was cofounded by Therese Coveney, whose 14-year-old daughter April gave her the impetus to set up the social enterprise. “I can feel change in the Dún Laoghaire/Blackrock area since the Happy Out cafe opened [in July 2023]. Most adults with Down syndrome rely on day services when they turn 21, but we wanted robust, industry-recognised training and a job to change the statistic that only 10 per cent of adults with Down syndrome work,” says Coveney. “After Covid, most of us understood what it was like to have meaningless, aimless days with no purpose. We are giving these young adults opportunities to be more independent, to be a valuable part of their community and to be paid employees.” Currently, there are 14 adults with Down syndrome on the roster at Happy Out in Dún Laoghaire. Each person does a three-hour shift – partly because they can’t work more than about 10 hours a week while keeping their disability allowance, but also because three hours is long enough for most of the employees. [ Down syndrome and employment: ‘It shouldn’t be amazing anymore, it should just be the norm’Opens in new window ] “In the beginning we found it hard to get enough guys to work with us but not now. They do everything from serving on the till, making and serving coffee and dealing with orders,” says Hanratty. The cafe has a card-only payment system which reduces potential for errors. Hanratty says the younger generation of customers love seeing adults with Down syndrome working in the cafe, but it has taken some older people a bit of time to get their heads around it. “Some ‘old school’ people don’t expect things to be done right and they will look to another staff member to make sure it’s really happening. But when they see that the staff member with Down syndrome has done the job well, they are very positive,” says Hanratty. The staff working regular eight-hour shifts also have to be a bit more flexible. “When we hire staff, we have to make sure that they know what they are taking on and be willing to help out in certain scenarios, and be more patient at times. They need to know that it’s different to a regular cafe.” Hanratty says the key to everything is to serve good coffee. “If the coffee isn’t good, people will come once and won’t come back, even if they think it’s a nice idea.” Ciara Donohoe from Newtownmountkennedy in Co Wicklow works on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays at Happy Out. “It’s really good and not too hard. It’s very challenging making the drinks and I’m still learning how to be a barista,” she says. [ Down syndrome: ‘Sarah regards herself as a businesswoman... she’s certainly breaking the stereotype’Opens in new window ] Charlie O’Reilly from Sandycove works on Mondays and Fridays: “I love chatting with customers and colleagues when I’m working at Happy Out. It’s a really good business.” Kim Williams from Shankill has a reputation for being good at latte art. “I also do the tills and take orders,” she says, admitting that walking through the cafe when it’s really busy can be a bit difficult. Cafe manager Matthew Roche says some of the staff with Down syndrome can get a bit flustered and emotional if it’s very busy. “We just take some time out in the foyer or outside if this happens – especially on busy days or at the weekends,” he explains. Building up people’s confidence to work front and centre in a public space has taken time, says Coveney. “When we first started training people, there was a lot of heads down, withdrawn people with their headphones on, but they have grown and flourished,” she says. “Working in a cafe won’t suit everyone, but there was something there waiting to be nurtured and educated. “It is about having higher expectations of these young adults but it would be naive to let them fly on their own. They need the supports around them.” Paula Doherty is the Pathways to Employment lead with the Together Academy. Her job involves finding work placements and paid employment for students who have completed the two-year culinary and hospitality programme that Together Academy runs at the Wanderers Football Club. [ Man with Down syndrome who wants to live independently brings council to court over housing assessmentOpens in new window ] “It’s about matching the person with the job and carving out a role for them. This can involve two or three tasks over two mornings a week from, say, 10am-1pm,” she says. “Some businesses are nervous about taking someone on, but once they meet with us and see the supports they get, it eases their minds.” The Together Academy provides backup support for the workers, meeting them before and after their job, and checking in every four to six weeks with three-, six- and 12-monthly reviews. They also do inclusive training with staff and set up a buddy system in the workplace so the person with Down syndrome has one key worker to turn to if they have any concerns. This summer the Together Academy will open a second, larger training centre in SMBC Aviation Capital on Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin. “This will be about providing more programmes for young adults with Down syndrome. It’s about elevating people’s expectations whilst giving people a lot of support,” says Coveney. She adds that all of the staff at Happy Out still live with their families and it has taken a lot of forbearance on their parts. “Many travel to work independently on public transport. We know that we are still working with vulnerable young adults. We take our role very responsibly.” Sylvia Thompson, a contributor to The Irish Times, writes about health, heritage and the environment © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Ather Energy IPO Post-listing Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk Ather Energy made a muted debut on the stock market, opening with a modest 2% gain before slipping 8% intraday to close at approximately ₹303—below its lower issue price of ₹304. The IPO saw a lukewarm response, with the retail portion subscribed just 1.89 times and the HNI segment at a mere 0.69 times. The stock’s weak listing and subsequent dip reflect cautious investor sentiment around its steep valuation. However, continued downward pressure could help realign its valuation, potentially making it more attractive to value-conscious investors. The Indian rupee slipped on Tuesday, tracking mild losses in regional peers and dollar demand from foreign banks, though broader weakness in the greenback limited the decline.

Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) had permitted general insurers to issue surety insurance bonds in April 2022. The bonds are legally enforceable tripartite contracts that seeks to provide hedge against risk involved with infrastructure projects. In the last decade, India has initiated 9,242 PPP infrastructure projects amounting to massive Rs. 68.13 lakh crore.

But he never cottoned to Bitcoin, although his stance about the technology behind digital assets softened over time. The 94-year-old Buffett, who made his surprise announcement at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting, maintained that Bitcoin would never endure as a unit of value, and once famously called Bitcoin “rat poison squared” in a May 2018 interview with CNBC’s "Squawk Box." He remained skeptical of its usefulness, even after meeting with some of the industry’s most powerful advocates. In a 2018 interview with CNBC earlier in the year, Buffett had said that “cryptocurrencies, generally... with almost certainty… will come to a bad ending." “When it happens or how or anything else, I don’t know,” he added in an interview from Omaha, Nebraska. “If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I’d be glad to do it, but I would never short a dime’s worth.” “We don’t own any, we’re not short on any, we’ll never have a position in them,” he added. “I get into enough trouble with things I think I know something about,” he added. “Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don’t know anything about?” As recently as 2023, even as the price of the asset had surged to new highs in the years prior, Buffett called Bitcoin a "gambling token." He said that people investing in it were chasing easy money, and that investors wanted to "play the roulette wheel" by putting funds into it. To be sure, Buffett was a reluctant tech investor, whose portfolio weighted more to companies in manufacturing and other traditional industries. He began buying shares in Apple only in 2016, although the personal device manufacturer later became the largest part of his holdings. Buffett’s rhetoric about the technology behind Bitcoin changed over the years, too. In a 2019 CNBC interview he said “blockchain was important,” although he called Bitcoin “a delusion" in the same discussion. His remarks echoed the opinions of financial services titans, including JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who praised blockchain technology but slammed Bitcoin. Those firms have subsequently debuted multiple crypto-focused initiatives over the years and shown an increasing willingness to embrace digital assets as a long-term fixture. (Fink is now a fan of Bitcoin; Dimon not so much.) Buffett reiterated his own more nuanced Bitcoin-Blockchain stance during a fancy dinner with Tron founder and crypto mogul Justin Sun, saying that while Bitcoin was just value changing hands and “no different from a seashell,” crypto companies were here to stay. “Bitcoin cannot capture the value of blockchain,” he said at the much-publicized 2020 dinner date. “Just because something has value doesn’t make it a good investment,” Buffett added. Buffett made a living off seeing a company’s value before everyone else, buying up its shares and being patient. But his distaste for the so-called digital gold was perhaps understandable: Buffett also famously avoided commodities like gold and oil.

Title: Cisco, UPS, other companies adjusting workforce as they embrace AI: report

Waystar CEO Matt Hawkins discusses denied healthcare claims and overturned rates on 'The Claman Countdown.' Some companies have been adjusting their workforce as they simultaneously embrace artificial intelligence and automation more, according to Forbes. The outlet reported over the weekend that Duolingo, UPS, Klarna, Cisco and Inuit are among some of the firms that have demonstrated that trend. Duolingo recently said it was striving to be "AI-first," with CEO Luis von Ahn outlining various measures that it will take to help accomplish that in a publicly available company-wide message, per Forbes. (Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Von Ahn said in the message that Duolingo will "gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle" and that headcount "will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work." When hiring and doing performance reviews, people’s abilities to use AI will also be part of what the company considers, according to the message. DUOLINGO ANNOUNCES 148 COURSES CREATED WITH GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LAUNCHING SOON ON PLATFORM The CEO said the "AI-first" moves focused on "removing bottlenecks so we can do more with the outstanding Duos we have" rather than "replacing Duos with AI." At UPS, some 20,000 employees are getting the ax, the company announced in late April. Forbes reported that UPS said AI wasn’t directly taking the place of employees, but the company is working to increase its efficiency through more automation and AI tools, something that the outlet said helped with shrinking its labor demands. UPS and Amazon, its largest customer, agreed in January that the e-commerce giant would reduce its package volume with UPS by more than 50%. Klarna has been leaning into AI more in recent years, using it for customer service, transaction processing and other functions, according to Forbes. (Jonas Walzberg/picture alliance via Getty Images) CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has said in the past that certain human work functions can be done by AI, the outlet reported. In February last year, the company said that an AI chatbot it launched was capable of doing the work of 700 full-time agents. AI has enabled Klarna to have a smaller workforce, according to Forbes. Last fall, Cisco Systems embarked on a restructuring so it could invest in AI, cybersecurity and other growth areas, the outlet reported. When announcing the restructuring, the company also said in an SEC filing the move would "drive more efficiencies in its business." AI ENERGY DEMAND IN US WILL SURGE BUT ALSO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY TO MANAGE ENERGY Roughly 7% of the company’s workers lost their jobs as part of the restructuring. Cisco has been putting artificial intelligence into network management and customer support systems, Forbes reported. Meanwhile, Intuit announced layoffs of 1,800 workers in July last year as part of a reorganization to boost its investments in artificial intelligence, according to the outlet. CEO Sasan Goodarzi said the reorganization would "enable us to allocate additional investments to our most critical areas to support our customers and drive growth," per a company-wide email that the company included in an SEC filing at the time. The company identified AI-powered tools it offers as some of the initiatives that it wanted to put more money into, Forbes reported. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File) At the same time, Goodarzi said Intuit would hire 1,800 new people "primarily in engineering, product, and customer-facing roles" to support its growth areas. A MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI started seeing a major increase in uptake in the wake of OpenAI releasing its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, spurring major investments and innovations in the sector.

Title: Trump shrugs off warnings over trade war costs

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Trump's tariffs are spiraling the U.S. toward an economic crisis as shipments slow down — and China doesn't plan to back down China vowed this week it would "never kneel down" to America in President Donald Trump's tariff war, as shipments of goods from China to the U.S. plummeted and economists and retailers warned of impending price hikes and empty store shelves. With most Chinese imports facing a 145 percent levy, "essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased," said Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka. The chief economist of asset management giant Apollo, Torsten Slok, said he expects "empty shelves in U.S. stores in a few weeks" and "Covid-like shortages for consumers." That slowdown, Slok said, would result in "significant" layoffs in retail, trucking, and other sectors. Trump signaled his readiness to negotiate "substantial" tariff cuts and claimed Chinese President Xi Jinping had called him. But officials in Beijing denied negotiations were taking place and struck a defiant tone. "Bowing to a bully is like drinking poison to quench thirst," China's Foreign Ministry declared in a social media video. A report that Amazon would display the cost of Trump's tariffs alongside the price of products prompted fierce blowback from the White House; Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it a "hostile and political act." The company quickly disavowed any such plan, saying it was under consideration only for its low-cost Haul store and "was never approved." Trump said he'd called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and "solved the problem very quickly," praising him as a "good guy" who "did the right thing." Trump signed an executive order easing a 25 percent tariff on imported parts used by U.S. automakers. Foreign-made autos will remain subject to a 25 percent tax. Trump called it a "short term" allowance for automakers, who say the import duties will spike prices, cut sales, and lead to layoffs. But at a rally in Michigan, Trump vowed to stay the course on tariffs, and ultimately "slaughter" carmakers who don't shift production to the U.S. In an ABC News interview, he rejected the idea that American consumers would see any price rises. "China probably will eat those tariffs," he said. "Everything's going to be just fine." Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

"Economic mayhem is setting in" thanks to Trump's "crackpot tariff ideas," said the Houston Chronicle. The stock market has recorded its worst first 100 days of any presidential term since Gerald Ford took office in 1974, with the S&P 500 down 7.9 percent. Corporations are starting to furlough workers and pause expansion plans. And because tariff costs are ultimately passed along to consumers—not foreign firms as Trump likes to claim—a typical American family can expect its expenses to climb by $2,700 a year. "It won't be the president's billionaire buddies bearing the costs for them." Amazon should have stuck with its "brilliant tariff idea," saidThe Wall Street Journal. Tariffs are taxes, and online shoppers already get to see how they much they have to cough up in state taxes when they check out. Americans would benefit greatly from clarity about exactly what Trump's tariffs will cost them, but "instead of owning its policy," the White House "bullied Amazon to keep quiet." What is Trump afraid of? Small businesses across the U.S. are reeling, said Daisuke Wakabayashi in The New York Times. Hundreds of owners tell the Times they've "been stunned into paralysis" by the tariffs and the uncertainty of what's coming next. Tim Fulton, who runs a business in Alaska making conveyor belts for airline cargo, had to raise prices due to new tariffs on essential components that are only made overseas, like motorized rollers from Japan. A pipeline of interested customers then "disappeared overnight," and potential investors retreated. Instead of growing his business, Fulton is now consulting a bankruptcy lawyer. Consumers haven't yet felt the sting, but they will soon, said Dominic Pino in The Washington Post. There's a lag, because ships from China take a month to cross the Pacific Ocean and because retailers loaded up on inventory before the tariffs hit. But "boatloads of pain" will land when retailers run out of product and choose to restock at much higher prices—or decide to let shelves sit empty. Trump's tariffs "might steal Christmas," said The Economist. Some 80 percent of the toys sold here come from China. Production "has ground to a halt," and unless import duties are slashed, nearly half the small-and medium-size firms surveyed by The Toy Association say they'll be out of business within months. Trump is taking a phenomenal risk, said Adam Cancryn in Politico. He was elected on promises of lower prices and an economic "golden age." Instead, his "chaotic" tariffs are "shaking the foundations" of America's financial system and have put his approval rating underwater by double digits. True to form, Trump is blaming stock market woes on former President Joe Biden, said Mark Antonio Wright in National Review, claiming this week it's suffering a Biden "overhang." But "every American" knows Trump owns these tariffs—and any economic fallout. A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com "We are on the verge of an economic crisis that could leave America poorer for generations," said James Briggs in The Indianapolis Star. It doesn't feel that way now. But recall early 2020, when we knew a lethal novel virus was coming for us and blithely went about our lives. Life felt normal, "until it didn't." Right now, "the vast majority of economic indicators are screaming crisis," the dollar is down, and CEOs say we're heading for a recession. With Trump's next moves uncertain, "the future is unwritten, but the risks are coming into focus." Trump's levies are being challenged by a raft of lawsuits, said Erik Larson in Bloomberg. Attorneys general from 12 states and legal advocacy groups representing numerous businesses have sued, arguing that Trump's claiming of emergency powers to impose the tariffs is unconstitutional. This week, the administration asked the U.S. trade court to reject one such suit, saying the plaintiffs are improperly "inviting judicial second-guessing of the president's judgment." Meanwhile, China shows no sign it's ready to back down, said Ryan Hass in Time. With no competitive elections, its leaders believe China's political system is "more unified, hardened, and disciplined than the Trump administration to withstand a trade war." And the Chinese have "tools at hand to hit America's economy where it hurts, including the withholding of critical minerals and key inputs to America's industrial value chains." In short, "Beijing believes time is on its side," so if there's going to be a retreat in the trade war, "it will need to come from Trump."

Title: Rite Aid files for bankruptcy — again | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Rite Aid on Monday announced it is filing for bankruptcy for a second time, barely just seven months after the chain exited Chapter 11 and emerged as a private company. The financially strapped drug store chain said it is looking for a buyer, and re-filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will help facilitate that process. The company said it would keep its stores open throughout its bankruptcy. “While we have continued to face financial challenges, intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and healthcare landscapes in which we operate, we are encouraged by meaningful interest from a number of potential national and regional strategic acquirors,” said Matt Schroeder, Rite Aid’s CEO, in a statement. “As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible.” Rite Aid first filed for bankruptcy in October 2023, becoming a casualty of a miserable environment for drug stores, exacerbated by its runner-up status to bigger chains and expensive legal battles for allegedly filling unlawful opioid prescriptions that pushed its debt to nearly $4 billion. It took about a year to navigate the Chapter 11 process, finally emerging in September 2024 by slashing $2 billion in debt, securing $2.5 billion in funds to keep operating and the closure of about 500 locations. On Monday, Rite Aid said it secured nearly $2 billion in new financing to keep it operational during its bankruptcy. Rite Aid is a distant third-largest nationwide standalone pharmacy chain in the United States — and the seventh largest pharmacy overall, when taking into account big box chains. It has about 1,250 stores remaining — roughly half of the number it had just two years ago. It was offered a $17 billion lifeline in 2015 when Walgreens offered to buy the chain. But the deal was met with stiff scrutiny from US regulators who feared the combination would violate federal antitrust laws and reduce competition in the drug store market. Ultimately, in 2017, the companies agreed to a smaller, $4.4 billion deal, in which Walgreens bought just under 2,000 Rite Aid locations, leaving Rite Aid diminished in stature and unable to compete at the scale of its bigger rivals. Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, a data analytics company, said he was not surprised by Rite Aid’s second bankruptcy, since the drug store chain hasn’t been able to secure enough inventory to keep shelves stocked. “The first bankruptcy did little to resolve the chain’s issues, and it has been teetering on the edge of survival for quite some time,” Saunders said. With Walgreens no longer in a position to buy Rite Aid outright, the most likely outcome is that other drug store and retail chains will “cherry pick” individual Rite Aid stores to purchase and keep open, Saunders said. Rite Aid’s bankruptcy comes amid struggles for its rivals, too. Walgreens Boots Alliance announced in March that it’s being taken private in a deal valued up to $24 billion, following a largely disastrous run on the public markets where its market cap has lost billions and more than 1,200 of its locations have closed or plan to close. The transaction is expected to be finalized later this year. Related article Why Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid are closing thousands of drug stores across America At CVS, the chain has closed more than 1,000 stores and undergone thousands of layoffs over the past several months. The company is experimenting with a new, smaller-format store that only focuses on the pharmacy rather than the retail part. All three chains have struggled with declining prescription reimbursements in recent years, sending its value plummeting to just around $9.5 billion from $100 billion a decade ago. They have also all become ubiquitous and over-expanded, with the chains becoming synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick-up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they’ve struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Walgreens Boots Alliance announced in March that it’s being taken private in a deal valued up to $24 billion, following a largely disastrous run on the public markets where its market cap has lost billions and more than 1,200 of its locations have closed or plan to close. The transaction is expected to be finalized later this year. At CVS, the chain has closed more than 1,000 stores and undergone thousands of layoffs over the past several months. The company is experimenting with a new, smaller-format store that only focuses on the pharmacy rather than the retail part. All three chains have struggled with declining prescription reimbursements in recent years, sending its value plummeting to just around $9.5 billion from $100 billion a decade ago. They have also all become ubiquitous and over-expanded, with the chains becoming synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick-up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they’ve struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability.

The problems in question are wide-ranging, from medicine and cybersecurity to materials science and chemistry. But first, there are very practical problems to be solved, such as developing chips that can reliably host large numbers of qubits — short for quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing. As usual in a high-stakes tech race with an uncertain time horizon, tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are at the forefront. Yet startups are also set to play an important role, especially tackling bottlenecks like connectivity and error correction that are critical for scaling quantum systems. But some startups and smaller tech companies are taking on the chip challenge head-on and deserve mention alongside the more attention-grabbing efforts from industry giants. While Big Tech projects typically boast the highest qubit counts, rethinking designs from first principles and using different approaches could yield equally promising results. Here are some of the companies behind the main quantum chip projects that are worth tracking. Akhetonics is a German photonics startup working on an all-optical, general-purpose chip — a contrarian bet in a field where most focus on narrower applications. This bold version and its first-principles approach helped the company raise a €6 million seed funding round led by Matterwave Ventures in November 2024. Alice & Bob is a French startup that raised a $104 million Series B round of funding in January 2025 to continue working toward building a “fault tolerant” quantum computer. Unlike companies focusing only on chips, Alice & Bob is developing a full quantum computing system. To do so, it relies on cat qubits, a type of superconducting qubit designed to reduce errors and simplify error correction. Amazon officially joined the quantum chip race in early 2025 when AWS introduced Ocelot, developed in partnership with the California Institute of Technology. While this is the company’s first quantum chip, AWS had previously launched Braket, a quantum computing service, in partnership with D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti, and others. Atom Computing is a U.S. company building quantum computers with arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms. At the Microsoft Ignite 2024 conference, Microsoft and Atom Computing announced plans to launch a commercial quantum computer in 2025. D-Wave is a quantum computing company whose latest flagship system, the Advantage2 prototype, relies on a process called quantum annealing, which uses quantum physics to find the most stable, lowest-energy arrangements of elements to figure out the best mix for a given problem. Founded in 1999 as a spinoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada, D-Wave is now a public company listed on the NYSE. Illinois-based EeroQ is a startup betting on helium for its quantum chip design. Having raised a $7.25 million seed funding round in 2022 and received regional public support, the company made a $1.1 million commitment in September 2024 toward expanding its HQ in Chicago’s Humboldt Park. In April 2025, Fujitsu and Japanese research institution RIKEN announced having developed a 256-qubit superconducting quantum computer at the RIKEN RQC-FUJITSU Collaboration Center, up from a 64-qubit iteration in 2023. In December 2024, Google announced Willow, its latest quantum computing chip. Google didn’t stop at saying Willow was better than its predecessor, Sycamore, or at describing it as “a major breakthrough in quantum error correction.” In a statement that made headlines, Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven wrote that Willow’s performance lent “credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes.” IBM’s quantum efforts include Condor, its milestone superconducting chip for scaling up to 1,121 qubits, and Heron, a 156-qubit processor focused on improved performance and lower error rates. Founded in 2007, Infleqtion (formerly ColdQuanta) is a US-based company developing quantum computers based on neutral atom technology. Intel is developing quantum computers based on silicon spin qubits. In June 2023, it unveiled Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit research chip, and said a next-generation quantum chip based on Tunnel Falls was expected to be released in 2024, but this hasn’t happened. IonQ is a publicly listed U.S. company developing trapped-ion quantum computers, including the IonQ Forte. After going public via a SPAC in late 2021, it acquired Canadian networking specialist Entangled Networks. IQM is a Finnish startup building superconducting quantum computers and is a spinout of the Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It received funding in its early days from the Business Finland government agency, followed by additional support from the EIC Accelerator program. In 2022, IQM raised €128 million in Series A2 funding led by World Fund, adding to the €39 million led by MIG Fonds it had raised in 2020 as part of what was then its Series A. This second tranche included part of a previously announced €35 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank, as well as participation from the EIC Fund and others. In February 2025, Microsoft introduced Majorana, a quantum chip using a topological core architecture. Microsoft previously declared that it expected to build a quantum supercomputer within 10 years. As its name suggests, Oxford Ionics is a British startup that spun out of Oxford University and focuses on trapped-ion quantum computing. It raised a £30 million Series A (approximately $36 million) in early 2023, followed by an additional £2 million (approximately €2.32 million) from the UK’s National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) that same year. More recently, it was selected for DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) alongside Quantinuum. Pasqal is a French startup taking a full-stack approach to quantum computing and betting on neutral atoms. The company emerged out of the Institut d’Optique in 2019, and its co-founders include 2022 Nobel Prize laureate for physics and professor Alain Aspect. In February 2023, Pascal raised a €100 million Series B funding round led by Singapore’s Temasek, with participation from existing investors Quantonation, the Defense Innovation Fund, Daphni, and Eni Next, as well as new investors European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund, Wa’ed Ventures, and Bpifrance (through its Large Venture Fund). PsiQuantum is a quantum computing startup using photonics technology and aiming to build “a 1 million-quantum-bit machine.” In February 2025, it announced Omega, a quantum photonic chipset manufactured at GlobalFoundries in New York. In 2021, PsiQuantum landed a $450 million Series D investment led by BlackRock, which is now said to be leading a potential $750 million round into the company at a $6 billion pre-money valuation. Founded by Australian academics, it is also backed by the Australian and Queensland governments. Qilimanjaro is a Spanish startup focusing on analog quantum app-specific integrated circuits (QASICs) and taking a full-stack approach, including hardware, software, and applications. Based in Barcelona, it won the Four Years From Now startup competition at Mobile World Congress in 2024, going on to receive €1.5 million in funding from Catalonia later that year. Quandela is a French startup founded in 2017 to develop photonic quantum computers. In November 2023, Quandela raised a €50 million Series B and received support from the French government through the France 2030 Plan. Quantinuum is a quantum computing company formed in 2021 by the merger of Cambridge Quantum and Honeywell Quantum Solutions. Its flagship product is the H-Series of trapped-ion quantum computers. In April 2024, together with Microsoft, it announced a breakthrough in error correction. QuantWare is a Dutch startup that came up with a proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, which focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs). It started accepting preorders for Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction, in February 2025. Founded in 2020, it is a spinout of TU Delft and its affiliated research institute, QuTech. In March 2025, and following a €6 million seed round in 2023, it announced having raised a €20 million Series A (approximately $19.27 million) — including €5 million in equity out of the €7.5 million it previously secured from the European Innovation Council (the remainder is a grant). Boston-based QuEra is betting on neutral atoms as the “best approach to achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.” Its products include Aquila, a 256-qubit analog neutral-atom quantum computer launched in 2022 and accessible via Amazon Braket. QuEra is notably backed by Google, which led the $230 debt round that the quantum startup raised in February 2025 — with a convertible note also backed by SoftBank, Valor, and existing investors. Founded in 2013 by Chad Rigetti, Rigetti Computing is a quantum company focusing on superconducting technology. Its range of products include Ankaa-3 and the uppcoming 336-qubit Lyra system. Just like rivals D-Wave and IonQ, Rigetti Computing is a listed company; it raised just under $200 million in VC capital before going public via a SPAC in 2021. In February 2025, it signed a strategic partnership with Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, which is set to invest $35 million and purchase shares of Rigetti, while both companies invest more than $100 million each over the next five years to accelerate the development and commercialization of superconducting quantum computing. U.S. quantum startup SEEQC — an acronym for “scalable, energy efficient quantum computing” — is a spinout of chip company Hypres, which was itself established by former employees of IBM’s superconducting electronics division. In 2023, SEEQC announced a partnership with Nvidia to build an “all-digital, ultra-low-latency chip-to-chip link between quantum computers and GPUs.” In January 2025, SEEQC raised a $30 million round of funding co-led by Booz Allen Ventures and Japanese-European VC firm NordicNinja. Other backers include Merck’s corporate venture capital arm, M Ventures. SEEQC is leading the U.K.-supported QuPharma project to explore how quantum computing can accelerate drug discovery, in partnership with BASF and Merck. SpinQ is a Chinese startup founded in 2018 that develops quantum computers. It claims that some of them are portable and making use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Xanadu is a Canadian startup aiming to build quantum computers through a photonic approach. In January 2025, it introduced Aurora, a 12-qubit system, including 35 photonic chips. Founded in 2016, Xanadu raised some $275 million to date, including a $100 million Series C in November 2022 at a $1 billion valuation.

Title: Supply Chain Expert: “It’s Going To Be An Extinction-Level, Asteroid-Wiping-Out-The-Dinosaurs Kind Of Event”

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Are you ready for store shelves to start emptying all over America? When I first started writing about the coming shortages last month, I received quite a bit of criticism. But now expert after expert is warning that we really are facing a crisis of historic proportions. Most major retailers still have several weeks of inventory on hand, but after that shortages are going to start becoming very visible. For smaller businesses, the shortages will be noticeable a lot sooner. On Sunday, I visited a local small business to purchase some groceries. In addition to selling groceries, this particular discount store also sells a wide variety of other products, and some of them are made in China. As I walked through the aisles, I was stunned by how low their stock levels were. Honestly, it was kind of depressing. Of course anything that we are witnessing now is just the leading edge of what is eventually coming. According to CNN, it is being estimated that “Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year”… The historically high tariff on China has effectively stopped all trade between the two countries, Trump has said repeatedly. The number of cargo ships headed from China to the United States fell 60% in April, according to Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. JPMorgan estimates Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year. American consumers should expect pandemic-like disruptions as goods that were warehoused before tariffs took effect begin to run out over the next week or so, including higher prices, shortages and empty store shelves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the high tariff on China are “unsustainable,” and Trump also said he expects the tariff to come down. But it would need to come down significantly – by more than half – for any real trade to recommence, trade experts say. But even then, the economic damage would be done — and it would be weeks or even months before American shelves would be replenished. This is going to be catastrophic. Anyone that cannot see this simply does not understand how our system works. Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen is a supply chain expert that helps thousands of businesses move products around the globe, and he is warning that we are facing “an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event”… “If they don’t change the tariffs, it’s going to be an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event,” he told me. “Only these aren’t dinosaurs. These are dynamic, healthy businesses.” He knows this because those businesses are his customers. They use Flexport to transport products from the factory to your front door. Petersen’s company handles everything from booking space on planes, trucks and enormous ocean carriers to managing all the tedious paperwork along the way. Ryan Petersen knows exactly what he is talking about, because dealing with supply chains is what he does for a living. According to Petersen, container bookings from China to the United States have already fallen by 60 percent… But since the tariffs took effect, ocean-freight bookings from China to the U.S. have dropped 60%, Petersen says. In response, containership operators are shrinking their boats and canceling trips altogether. It takes a while for downstream consequences to flow through the system—but logistics nerds can look at the data on their screens and see into the future. If tariffs continue at this rate, Petersen says, it’s only a matter of time before that asteroid hits. There are thousands upon thousands of products that are made in China that aren’t made anywhere else. And it takes years to build new factories and set up new supply chains. So how are we possibly going to replace the 438 billion dollars of imports from China that normally fill up our store shelves? Of course the truth is that we aren’t going to replace those imports and store shelves will soon start getting emptier and emptier. In addition, it is likely that we will see massive layoffs as supply chains all over the U.S. slow down dramatically. Southern California is one area that will get hit particularly hard… With more than 70% of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LA’s waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) local 13. “One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports – warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more,” said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LA’s Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected. Even if President Trump made a deal with China this week, we are being told that it could take up to a year for our supply chains to fully return to normal… “These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.” The good news is that it appears that the Chinese are open to beginning negotiations with the Trump administration. But the Chinese are insisting that they will not be coerced into making a deal. There had been hope that tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced in an attempt to get China to the negotiating table, but President Trump has slammed the door on that possibility… When Welker directly asked, “You’re not dropping the tariffs against China to get them to the negotiating table?” Trump’s response was unequivocal: “No.” His firm stance underscores a broader strategy of using tariffs as leverage to protect American economic interests and curb China’s global influence. Even if negotiations commenced tomorrow, we would probably not see a deal with China until months from now. Meanwhile, our supply chain crisis will continue to get worse with each passing day. If there is anything that is made in China that you are going to need, I would get it immediately. It does not appear that President Trump plans to reverse course on his tariffs any time soon. In fact, he just unveiled a new 25 percent tariff rate on most foreign-made auto parts… President Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made auto parts began on May 3, with automakers receiving some concessions from the administration but still feeling the heat on others. Trump signed an executive order formalizing the new rules late last week, which gave some carve-outs to what would have been blanket 25% tariffs on imported auto parts. Everything from foreign-made powertrain components to seats and airbags is affected. This is not a drill. A global trade war is here, and it is going to cause immense pain all over the planet. It won’t be too long before empty shelves start appearing all over America. So if there is something that you need to get done, get it done now.

Title: Germany's chancellor-in-waiting: Who is Friedrich Merz?
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-chancellor-in-waiting-who-is-friedrich-merz/a-72314352
Time Published: 2025-05-05T19:15:00Z

He has never held a top position in government, yet he has become Germany's tenth chancellor. DW takes a look at the life of Friedrich Merz. Friedrich Merz has made it to the chancellery after a bumpy start. He needed an unprecedented second vote to secure the necessary majority in the Bundestag in what was a historic debacle in German politics. Now Merz's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) the regional Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) will be working together as Germany's new government. For Merz, it is a big step in an unusual career. Merz, who is 69 years old, has never held a top governmental office with significant leadership responsibilities. He has never been a federal minister, or a state premier, or even mayor of a small town. He is the oldest chancellor to take office since Konrad Adenauer, the first post-war German head of government (1949–1963). The previous weeks were also the first time he had ever taken part in negotiations aimed at forming a government coalition. The media, as well as some unnamed representatives from the negotiation teams, have at times held this against him. The SPD leaders, Lars Klingbeil and Saskia Esken, and the head of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), Markus Söder, all have experience in this particular kind of wrangling. But as the would-be head of government, Merz hopes to lead a coalition between the CDU and these parties, and mediate between their interests. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video According to the German business magazine Wirtschaftswoche, Merz is a "trans-atlanticist, friend of Europe, and reformer." This, it wrote, could mean he was "exactly the right person for the current times." From 1989 to 1994, Merz was a member of the European Parliament. This was followed by 15 years in the Bundestag, between 1994 and 2009, during which he rose to become head of the CDU's parliamentary group, only to lose out to Angela Merkel in a struggle for the party leadership. Over these years, he took a particular interest in Germany's relationship with the United States. A commercial lawyer, Merz hails from Sauerland, an area of North Rhine-Westphalia, east of the Ruhr, where he still lives. It's predominantly a middle-class, rural region, popular with tourists, that tends to espouse conservative, Catholic values. Merz was clearly more traditionally conservative than his East German rival, the quantum chemist Angela Merkel. Early in his career, he was a close confidant of the now-deceased veteran CDU politician Wolfgang Schäuble, who was a member of the German parliament for more than 50 years. Merz chose not to stand for parliament again in 2009, and went on to pursue a career in business. From 2016 to 2020, he was chairman of the supervisory board of the German arm of BlackRock, currently the world's largest asset management company, and during this time he was often in the United States on business. It wasn't until 2021 that Merz ran again for the Bundestag, and was elected. In fleshing out his plans for government, he has been more outspoken than his taciturn predecessorOlaf Scholz, Merz frequently makes a point of mentioning that, for several months now, he has been in regular contact with European heads of government: dinner with France's President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace, bilateral talks in Berlin or Brussels. He also intends to travel to the US before the summer recess to meet Republican President Donald Trump. In a particularly striking example, Merz gave an hour-long TV interview to the German political talk show Caren Miosga eight days before the Easter weekend, in which he spoke about continuing military aid to Ukraine, going significantly beyond the "red line" repeatedly drawn by Chancellor Scholz. Merz raised the prospect of Germany delivering Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv. These long-range, high-impact weapons would be of great assistance to Ukraine, and could seriously pressure Russia. He added that the UK, France, and US had already been supplying cruise missiles, and if the weapons supply was coordinated with its allies, "Germany should also participate." He commented that the Ukrainian army "has to get out of the defensive position — all it does is react." It needed to "be able to exert some control over what's happening." Merz even explicitly mentioned the possibility of Ukraine destroying the Crimean Bridge, a key strategic link between Russia and the unilaterally annexed Crimean peninsula. With this rhetoric and level of detail, Merz has positioned himself in direct opposition to Scholz, who consistently opposed Taurus deliveries and warned against any further escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Continued support for Ukraine is only one element of the broader political upheaval in Germany that has resulted from the policies of the new US administration — an upheaval that at times has caused Merz's standing and credibility to plummet. For months, both in the Bundestag and on the campaign trail, Merz and other conservative politicians emphasized the importance of adhering to Germany's debt brake, and called for fiscal discipline. This abruptly changed with the start of the exploratory talks between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. By mid-March, both of Germany's legislative chambers had approved a historically unprecedented decision: From now on, there will be no cap on defense spending. A package worth €500 billion ($570 billion) is also being introduced, aimed at improving Germany's crumbling infrastructure. This entails easing the debt brake to which, during the election campaign, the CDU and CSU had initially promised to adhere. Meanwhile, Merz — and all the mainstream parties — have the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) pressuring them from behind. Observers say the AfD's gains in the most recent election have prompted the future coalition partners to include stricter immigration policies and a greater focus on internal security in the coalition agreement. Just days before the federal election, Merz sparked controversy and confusion, both at home and abroad, by effectively weakening the "firewall" that he, along with all the other mainstream parties, had pledged to maintain against the AfD. Merz accepted the AfD's backing in several parliamentary votes on migration policy, in a bid to help the CDU/CSU and pro-business Free Deomcratic Party (FDP) defeat the remaining red-green votes, which by then no longer held a majority. This move triggered a wave of outrage among politicians and in German civil society. Now, Merz says he wants to boost the confidence of the German people. "We are a great country of more than 80 million people, who live and work here and take care of their families," he said. He wants to show "that the effort is worth it."

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

Title: Netflix stock was supposed to be safe from the trade war. Then Trump talked movie tariffs

Netflix (NFLX) was supposed to get its happily ever after: Its stock had been skyrocketing, and Wall Street largely saw it as a recession-proof play amid swirling macroeconomic concerns. But that all changed with one social media post from President Donald Trump, in which he announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on all movies made outside the U.S. The president wrote Sunday night on his Truth Media social platform that the “Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death.” Trump claimed that other countries are offering incentives to studios outside the country, which is “a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” He finished the post: “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick responded on X, saying, “We’re on it.” As of now, there are no details on how this plan will be implemented or what will be included in these tariffs. Netflix’s stock price fell almost 3.7% between Friday’s close and Monday’s open. It’s since risen some throughout the day, but it’s still down about 1.3% as of midday. This sudden fall marks a stark reversal from late April, when a bullish analyst report from William Blair said Netflix is “currently not experiencing economic headwinds with stable retention” after its strong quarter. The financial services firm maintained its “outperform” rating for Netflix’s stock. “Netflix is relatively more insulated from the recent market turmoil because it is not overly exposed to tariffs and will be relatively resilient in any potential future economic downturn,” analysts Ralph Schackart and Jack Brenczewski wrote in the report. “Overall, Netflix remains well positioned to remain a secular streaming winner, in our view, and we believe longer term it will continue to have pricing power.” Other entertainment companies have seen somewhat similar dips following Trump’s social media post. Paramount’s (PARA) stock is down 0.7%, Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) is down 0.6%, and Lions Gate (LGF.A) is a big loser on the day, down 5.4% as of early Monday afternoon. Disney’s (DIS) stock fell but has since recovered its earlier losses, up 0.1%, similar to Comcast (CMCSA), which was up 0.4%. Key details of the president’s plan remain unclear, including whether the tariff would apply only to theatrical releases or also to streaming content, how it would be calculated — by production budget or box office revenue — and whether it would affect TV shows or already-completed films. Citigroup (C) analyst Jason Bazinet told The Wrap that, in a worst-case scenario, Netflix could face a 20% decline in earnings and an annual cost increase of $3 billion. He said, however, that the actual impact is likely to be significantly lower. According to Citigroup’s analysis, the streaming platform currently spends about $17 billion per year on content, with 60% of that being original productions and the remaining 40% licensed. Of the original content, half is produced outside the U.S. Based on these figures, a 100% tariff on movies could reduce earnings per share by 20%, or approximately six cents. And that cost could be passed on to Netflix’s consumers. “If we assume U.S. production costs are 35% higher than non-U.S. costs, it’s akin to a $1 billion increase in annual costs,” Bazinet said. “If this cost is borne by U.S. consumers, it would cause [average revenue per user in the U.S. and Canada] to rise about 7%.” Trump addressed his planned movie tariffs in front of reporters later Sunday after returning from Mar-a-Lago. He said, “I’ve done some very strong research over the past week, and we’re making very few movies now. Hollywood is being destroyed. Now, you have a grossly incompetent governor that allowed that to happen, so I’m not just blaming other nations, but other nations have stolen our movie industry.” Hollywood producers and labor unions have been urging Governor Gavin Newsom to boost the state’s tax incentives to better compete with other locations. A ProdPro survey of executives found California was the sixth most-preferred place to film in the next couple of years, behind Toronto, the U.K, Vancouver, Central Europe, and Australia. When speaking to reporters, Trump also accused other countries of stealing America’s “moviemaking capabilities” and said their financial support for Hollywood films was “sort of a threat to our country in a sense.” In January, Trump named Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone, and Mel Gibson as “special ambassadors” to bring a “troubled” Hollywood back “bigger, better and stronger than ever before.” Sources told Variety that Voight and his manager, Steven Paul, have been taking meetings with various guilds to advise the president on how to reinvigorate filming in the U.S. Under Trump’s proposal, nearly all of this year’s major blockbusters would have been affected, including the top-grossing Minecraft Movie, filmed in New Zealand, and Captain America: Brave New World, which was shot across multiple countries, including the U.S. Coming releases such as Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning and the John Wick spin-off Ballerina would also feel the weight of the president’s tariffs. Gibson, meanwhile, has been planning to shoot his Passion of the Christ sequel in Italy. “I think the most likely consequence is not that more productions will be done outside of America, or more productions would be done in America, but probably that just fewer productions will (be made),” Scott Roxborough, the Europe bureau chief of the Hollywood Reporter, told Reuters. On Monday, the British media and entertainment union Bectu called on the British government to “move swiftly to defend this vital sector ... as a matter of essential national economic interest.” Officials in Australia and New Zealand also responded to Trump’s proposed movie tariffs by pledging support for their local sectors, which have become key global filming hubs — Marvel movies have been filmed in Australia, while New Zealand was home to The Lord of the Rings franchise. So will we see the third Dune movie filmed in New Mexico and the next Mission Impossible installment in South Dakota? For now, the only certainty is uncertainty — and a growing sense that Netflix’s “safe” status in a trade war may have been a Hollywood fantasy all along.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell, while the Dow gained. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) shares tumbled from an all-time high after legendary investor Warren Buffett said over the weekend that he would be stepping down as CEO at the end of the year. Shares of Netflix (NFLX) also slid after President Trump announced a 100% tariff on movies made outside the U.S. Tyson Foods (TSN) shares sank as the meat producer missed sales estimates and its outlook disappointed. EQT (EQT) shares gained on an upgrade and price target increase from UBS, which pointed to the strong performance and outlook for the natural gas provider. Shares of Newmont (NEM) and other gold miners climbed as the price of the precious metal, long viewed as a safe haven asset, rose. Skechers (SKX) shares soared as the shoe maker agreed to be taken private by investment firm 3G Capital for about $9.4 billion. Oil futures tumbled. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note advanced.

Title: Weighing The Positives Of Fully Remote Workplaces

ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. I'm the writer for the Forbes C-Suite newsletter series. ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. As technology continues to define business opportunities, there are basic needs that are integral to every development. Last week, I attended a panel at Honeywell’s Future of Energy Summit in Washington, D.C., at which top industry and policy leaders discussed two: energy and AI. Page Crahan, general manager of Tapestry at Google’s X, the Moonshot Factory, said that AI is becoming as ubiquitous among businesses as energy. “Would you ever ask a business owner if they use math?” Crahan asked. Gordon Bitko, IT Industry Council executive vice president of policy, said energy and AI are inextricably linked. “AI uses a lot of power, so the answer is: Let’s use more AI to figure out how to use less energy,” Bitko said. Industry has used AI technology for years to determine ways to be more efficient, so this sounds like a paradox. AI is being used to create hardware that can process data better, and it only makes sense to use AI to determine the best ways to generate power, optimize workloads and automate data centers. Crahan’s project is building an AI-powered, unified platform for the electric grid. Crahan said Tapestry is essentially creating “Google Maps for electrons” to figure out and predict what’s happening throughout the grid. And the rise of AI— which she called a wonderful tool for helping solve extremely complex problems with data—is coming at the perfect time. But while AI can find solutions, it comes back to the question of power. Bitko said that for AI to do its best, the U.S. needs to de-risk investment in the technologies that can improve performance and capacity for energy infrastructure, as well as get the critical materials available to build them. China has not been waiting to move forward, Bilko said, and the U.S. shouldn’t either. Crahan added that there’s another key to making quick advancements: People talking to one another and sharing their solutions. This isn’t just a matter of companies and countries talking, but also people from different parts of organizations communicating and understanding one another. “It’s really on us to take those actions forward, and that is what gives me a lot of optimism is this community is here for the change and we help each other,” Crahan said. “We want to drive change, and I think that’s really special.” Honeywell Global Regions CEO Anant Maheshwari moderated the discussion, in which Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-N.D.) also participated. Many companies are asking their employees to return to the office this year, but there are still fully remote companies. I spoke with Ann Schlemmer, CEO of software company Percona, about why her employees will not be asked to report to an office anytime soon. An excerpt from our conversation appears later in this newsletter. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last Wednesday. Last week, the markets fully recovered from the “Liberation Day” tariff announcement crash, with the S&P 500 seeing its longest winning streak since 2004. Investors were encouraged by better job growth than expected—177,000 non-farm jobs added from March to April, beating expectations of 133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics—and better-than-expected earnings reports from Big Tech, including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Inflation in March also moderated, according to Commerce Department data released last week, with the personal consumption expenditures index up 2.3% from last year, and core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—matching estimates of 2.6% in March. Even though these are positive metrics, they don’t necessarily indicate a recovering economy. While stocks have recovered from their low point in early April, markets are still down since Donald Trump’s presidency began in late January—the S&P is now 5% lower. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s first 100 days in office have been the worst for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 since President Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973. While there was more job growth than expected, a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that layoffs are way up—April’s cuts were up 63% compared to a year ago, and the more than 600,000 layoffs so far in 2025 are 87% higher than at this point in 2024. The firm found that 48% of the layoffs were tied to cuts made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci found troubling signs for employment underneath the strong job creation numbers. Worker confidence is down: 11.8% of the unemployed had left their jobs, down from 13.2% in January. Payroll numbers only increased by 0.3%, though inflation is much higher. Long-term unemployment is on the rise—1.9% of unemployed people have been without work for 15 weeks or longer, up from 1.4% in January. The economy as a whole also contracted significantly in the first quarter. According to the Bureau of Economic Research, GDP was down 0.3% compared with the last three months of 2024. That’s a drop from steady previous growth—GDP was up 2.4% in Q4—and the weakest growth since Q1 of 2022. Much of the drop in GDP came from fewer imports, as sweeping tariffs loom. And while the Trump administration has touted deals in progress—including talks to reduce a 145% tariff on China—nothing has been announced and Beijing says it is evaluating whether to negotiate. Tariffs are already reducing the amounts of goods shipped to the U.S. from China, setting the stage for fewer items on shelves in coming months, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Last week, the Trump Administration also eliminated the de minimis trade exemption, which allowed low-cost items from online retailers, including Temu and Shein, to be shipped to the U.S. duty-free. Now, items from those retailers are seeing a 145% tariff, more than doubling prices for U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, several companies anticipating a negative impact from tariffs for the rest of the year have reduced their estimates or pulled guidance. Warren Buffett in 2017. One of the world’s most respected CEOs unexpectedly announced over the weekend that he would step down at the end of the year. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is handing the reins of the firm to Berkshire Hathaway Energy CEO Greg Abel, which he announced at the end of his address at the annual shareholders’ meeting. Forbes’ Hank Tucker writes the news surprised nearly everyone there—board members and Abel included—though the timing seems to make sense. Buffett is 94 and worth some $168 billion over the weekend, according to Forbes estimates. Buffett has been Berkshire Hathaway CEO since 1965, and the announcement of his step down received a standing ovation. Abel, a 62-year-old Canadian who’s been with Berkshire since it acquired MidAmerican Energy in 1999, will have big shoes to fill. Buffett, known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” is an American legend for his shrewdness in investing. Even this year prior to Buffett’s announcement, Berkshire’s stock is up 19%, nearly matching its compounded annual gain of 19.9% from 1965 to 2024. Just about every company wants to improve its adoption of and expertise in AI this year, and C-suite executives are also getting into it. According to a recent survey by LinkedIn, 88% of C-suite execs say speeding AI adoption is a top priority this year. Executives are looking for their employees to become AI experts, but they aren’t forgetting themselves. C-suite leaders are 1.2 times more likely to add AI literacy skills to their LinkedIn profile than other professionals, and three times as many C-suite leaders have AI skills on their profiles now compared to two years ago. This isn’t to say that C-suites across the board are getting the AI skills they need. About four in 10 leaders said their top team is preventing AI adoption, citing reasons like lack of training, no change management plan, and failure to be convinced of AI’s ROI. LinkedIn and Microsoft have opened several AI skills courses, making them free of charge for several months. The time spent gaining AI skills is likely to pay off. LinkedIn found that 51% of organizations that adopted generative AI reported revenue increases of at least 10%. Percona CEO Ann Schlemmer. Open source database software company Percona has always been a fully remote company since its founding in 2006, so it was already in the swing of a distributed workforce when most of the country’s offices shut down for the Covid-19 pandemic. Percona currently has just over 350 employees located in 52 countries around the globe, and CEO Ann Schlemmer says they have no intention of requiring them to work together in an office somewhere. (Percona does have a headquarters office in North Carolina, where the COO works.) I talked to Schlemmer about being an all-remote company in a world that is moving toward requiring employees to return to the office. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. Why does being remote work for Percona? Schlemmer: We put a lot of work behind it. This was our intention from the very beginning: don’t let geography determine your talent. It also was a little bit of a labor arbitrage, that you could get high quality talent and maybe in lower cost centers. Trying to get all tech talent from Silicon Valley is really expensive. We have always been bootstrapped and customer-funded—we haven’t taken outside funding. That was also part of the drive: finding those areas of technical expertise globally that other people may not have found. Are you receiving more interest from potential employees now that a lot of workplaces are putting out return to office mandates? Yes. Flexibility [is a common reason] for sure. In our company, we’ve always had this mentality of being able to flex and have that flexibility as long as you get the job done. That said, not every job has flexibility. [In] some of our customer-facing roles, it’s very clear that you're expected to be available for the customers between certain hours. As a CEO, what I really care about is someone getting their job done in the time that we expect them to get it done and that they have the tools and capabilities to do that. Expectations with your colleagues on your availability would happen whether you’re remote or in person. There has to be a really high degree of trust when you are a remote worker—which also means that you need to have a high level of your own personal accountability in getting the job done, being clear on expectations and can you fulfill those expectations in that environment. With you at the helm, would you ever consider making Percona a company where people have to go into an office? I don’t see that it would ever be a whole company initiative. I could see that if there was a business case: That we had a specific team that was trying to drive new product innovation and the request was, we have the center and we want to be in person to do that, or we found that that really is the most effective. I could see that as very use-case specific. The company itself now, I wouldn't see the advantage of that. And for us in our structure, it would be a massive cost that I don’t think would give me an ROI that would make it appealing. What advice would you give to business leaders who have been much more remote since Covid and are trying to decide whether they should go back to an office? If the question is singularly return to the office or stay remote, start with what problem you are trying to solve and have clarity on that. Really large corporations have a big commercial investment that they’ve made into real estate, so, versus selling that off, they want a return on that investment. They want people coming in. And their culture and systems have been built around being in-person. That is pretty compelling. It’s a matter of defining what problem are you trying to solve, being clear on that and gaming it out to understand what are the consequences, positives, and potentially negatives of those decisions—which is what business leaders do anyway. They always have to weigh the cost of their decisions.

IBIT holdings surge as BlackRock's broader Bitcoin exposure strategy unfolds. BlackRock expanded its exposure to Bitcoin-linked assets in the first quarter of 2025, pushing its total investments to more than $5.4 billion, according to data from Timechainindex. Between the last quarter of 2024 and March 2025, BlackRock added over 3.2 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to its portfolio. This move brought its total IBIT holdings to around 5.85 million shares, valued at roughly $274 million. In an interesting shift, BlackRock also began investing in rival spot Bitcoin ETFs. It purchased nearly 71,000 shares of Fidelity’s FBTC and made smaller allocations to Grayscale’s GBTC and GBTC Mini products. This marks the firm’s first foray into rival ETFs, reflecting a broader strategy aimed at tapping into multiple channels of Bitcoin market exposure. Combined, these holdings are valued at more than $5 million. Altogether, BlackRock’s total position in spot Bitcoin ETFs has reached approximately $279 million. At the same time, the firm increased its exposure to companies with direct ties to Bitcoin. The asset management firm increased its stake in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) to over 14.4 million shares during the quarter. The firm also acquired more than 620,000 of MicroStrategy’s Series A preferred shares and nearly 15 million shares across two of the company’s commercial notes. These positions bring BlackRock’s total exposure to Strategy to over $4.23 billion. Meanwhile, BlackRock also deepened its positions in Bitcoin mining companies, pushing its investments in these cohorts to almost $1 billion, with investments in Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, TeraWulf, and others.

May 05, 2025 10:32 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, May 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether AppLovin and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until May 5, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired AppLovin securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On February 26, 2025, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research both published reports alleging, among other things, that AppLovin uses a “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations directly onto users’ phones” and is “stealing data from Meta in their e-commerce push.” Following publication of the reports, AppLovin’s stock price fell $46.06 per share, or 12.2%, to close at $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

May 05, 2025 09:10 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, May 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You may be a liability if you have outdated skill sets. With 2025 breaking records for the most layoffs in February since the pandemic, and the highest number of tech job cuts in April, you’re probably scared that you’ll be the next one receiving a mass email or invited to a suspicious HR call. Increasing numbers of employers are adapting to the AI era, and that means implementing sweeping changes or “restructuring” across their workforce and workflows, and removing employees who don’t align with their agenda or who are costing the company too much money or lack of “efficiency,” as they often term it. Additionally, some like Intel, as reported by TechCrunch, have had lower quarterly earnings than expected, which has necessitated these employers looking across their divisions and seeing what employees are core to the business and which ones they can do without or dispense with. Frankly, when employers make these layoff decisions, there are three top criteria that they evaluate which ultimately influence the specific employees they decide to let go. In an update sent via email, General Assembly interviewed HR directors and managers in tech companies and found that the employees most likely to be let go include those who display these five red flags: It may not be what you want to hear, especially when it comes to remote work, but this is the reality. Thankfully, there are things you can do about it. If you can be replaced by AI, the odds are you will be. And if you’re not sure if your job is prone to being replaced by automation, just check out this list of 21 jobs that are bound to be obsolete by 2030 and are rapidly declining even now. So if you discover that you’re working in a job at high risk of being fully automated, then now is the time to seriously consider making a career pivot. Consider other career paths and job opportunities that leverage your transferable skills and any industry background you have which might be relevant. Think about what you have a passion in, and take time to research what jobs and new skill sets will be in high demand right now, as new job titles are created. Your skills become outdated when you’re not willing to adapt and embrace change. If you remain stuck in the same mindset since you first embarked on your job or career, you will never grow. A growth mindset acknowledges changes that are happening, and instead of ignoring them, seeks to adapt by upskilling, undertaking more professional development, seeking out new opportunities, and reflecting on one’s progress. To ensure your skills are always up to date and in high demand, check out the core skills and rising skills you need in today’s labor market based on recent data from the World Economic Forum, so you can strengthen those areas and include them in your resume. It’s a good idea to periodically check in with your manager to assess how well you’re performing against key indicators and employee standards, including company culture. Don’t just be passive and wait for your boss to inform you when it’s too late. While a good manager will inform you without needing to be asked, some won’t, so you need to be proactive and regularly gauge your performance. Come well-prepared for your one-to-one meetings with your manager. Take time to be self-aware and journal your progress in your job. Note down areas where you could do with some improvement or support, as well as areas where you find you’re exceptionally strong in, and bring these to your line manager. Ask them for support in your weak areas and see if they could recommend or signpost you to peer mentorship or other internal company resources to support your growth. Outside of your job, take time to strengthen your incompetency by undergoing extra training and courses, and attending events if necessary. Of course, there will always be times when a company catches you by surprise and lists your name along with other underperforming employees in a cop-out to cover their atrocious layoffs. You should ensure that you have accurate documentation of your progress and conversations with your manager about your performance so you can challenge this if necessary. If you work in a department that is severely defunded or not receiving due attention and allocation of resources, that’s a strong warning sign that your job is likely on the line. If not now, it will be later. Keep your eyes and ears open for signs of senior leadership dismissing specific departments or projects as not being key priorities. Review your company’s annual statement, its vision, and long-term strategies for the next three to five years. These provide strong indicators of where the company is headed, what areas leadership wants to focus on, and where new job opportunities may arise. If you sense that your role or department might be eliminated in any way, ask your manager to consider how you can progress to another department or role internally. Proactively seek to engage with cross-functional teams and projects, get your hands dirty in everything, and become well-known to several employees within the company at different levels and departments, especially those at the senior leadership level. Make yourself seen and make your presence felt across different projects. This aligns you for better opportunities within the company, so if it decides to cut a project or department, you have already jumped ship to the right place. We’ve already seen this year how thousands of federal employees have been laid off or been threatened with layoffs if they would not comply with the new in-office working stipulations imposed by the Trump administration. Amazon also began mandating all its employees to work from the office five days a week in January, and other companies have also followed. Therefore, if you work within a large company that traditionally embraces hybrid or in-person work, consider yourself a liability. Even if your role is remote right now, there may come a time where it won’t be that way forever, and you’ll be forced to either switch to working more days or hours in the office, or handing in your notice. The safest way to avoid this while continuing to hold on to your remote working status is to opt into freelancing or independent contractor work, particularly where knowledge-based work is concerned. As a freelance professional, you can work on your own terms, on your own schedule, and from whatever location you please, so long as you get the job done. While many employers view remote workers, deprioritized projects, underperformance, outdated skill sets, and automation as valid reasons to lay off their employees, you don’t need to be affected by these red flags. Now that you know what influences the decisions at the top, you can use the tips and resources to future-proof your career and maintain job stability.

Title: News Influencers Are Reaching Young People, and the Media Is Trying to Keep Up

It’s no surprise that young Americans say social media is their preferred way to get news. But a growing number of them are turning to news influencers — those familiar faces who often share frank, relatable, direct-to-camera videos — to learn about what’s going on. In 2024, a Pew Research study found that about one in five Americans (21%) — including 37% of adults under 30 — said they regularly got news from influencers. Divya Nagarajan, 19, a student at Emory University, says that seeing the same people in her feed makes them feel more trustworthy. “It's kind of like the parasocial thing where it feels like I know them,” she tells Teen Vogue. Nagarajan says she favors the conversational tone news influencers use and the personal feel of their content vs. the onslaught of breaking alerts from legacy outlets. Says Rachel Karten, a social media consultant and author of the Link in Bio newsletter, whether it's TikTok or Instagram, people don’t want to leave the platforms where they already scroll, so you have to meet them where they are: "They're not there necessarily to consume news, but if it comes across their feed, they're going to watch it," she explains. "And they're going to start to maybe grow a connection with the person who is reporting that news.” Relatability, perceived trustworthiness, ease of consumption: These are just some of the reasons young people say they’re turning to these influencer voices. Online-first news outlets like NowThis and AJ+ have long understood this; more traditional outlets, however, have only just started experimenting with what has been called “talent-driven journalism,” hiring news influencers who have a strong personal brand to lead their social presence. Influencers can be a great way to connect with new audiences, but there are concerns that social content creators could be fueling the misinformation crisis. According to Pew, 77% of these influencers have no journalism background or affiliation with a news organization, which means they may not have strict standards for vetting the information they share. The growing interest in hiring or promoting camera-ready creators with a strong personal brand is also troubling for journalists who aren’t particularly interested in being social media stars. Of course, talent-driven journalism isn’t exactly new. From familiar names in print to favorite radio hosts to iconic CBS broadcaster Walter Cronkite’s comforting and constant "And that's the way it is" sign-off, people have long preferred voices they recognize. That recognition breeds trust, and it's no different on social media. So some traditional media companies are now bringing influencers in-house, or focusing on growing the followings of in-house creators, to help reach younger audiences. Mayra Báez, an audience strategist and AI consultant, helped launch AJ+, Al Jazeera’s social media news and storytelling project, in 2014, intertwining the outlet’s online brand with journalists' personal brands. In addition to making the news more engaging and approachable, Báez tells Teen Vogue via email, the move put journalists in direct conversation with audiences where they were increasingly spending time: on their phones. “Social media-first newsrooms started doing this over a decade ago; the difference is that legacy media is only now catching up, and not by choice, but out of necessity.” The Washington Post’s social media audience skews younger than its audiences on other platforms, according to the publication’s “TikTok guy” Dave Jorgenson, and audience members feel a personal connection to the account's hosts after seeing them in videos for years. “These people have been with us since they were teenagers, and we take that relationship very seriously,” he says. “We know for a fact that our audience trusts us more because of our presence on TikTok and [YouTube] Shorts.” Jorgenson, who launched the Post’s TikTok channel in 2019, recently spun off a Post-produced series, Local News International, on his personal YouTube channel. The series is designed to be cut down for vertical video and shared on the Post’s other accounts to help grow those audiences. In January, the Post doubled down on its talent-driven strategy, restructuring its public relations division to focus on developing a “star talent unit” — a move that resulted in layoffs at the outlet, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Stay up-to-date with the politics team. Sign up for the Teen Vogue Take Sara Sines, a 24-year-old dancer and performer, says she gets most of her news from influencers on social media, though the content often appears in her feed without her seeking it out. If she recognizes the face of someone whose approach she liked in the past, even if she doesn’t know their name, she stops to hear their take when they pop up on her For You page. For some publishers, social media has been the key to reaching new, younger audience members, like Sines, who may be unfamiliar with an outlet's nonsocial reporting. Morning Brew, which first launched as a business newsletter in 2015, has grown a stand-alone social media audience of millions of followers in part by leaning into creators, says Macy Gilliam, a video producer at the media company. “Young people like to follow people; they don't really like to follow brands,” she notes. "We are people at the brand, so it's kind of like bridging the gap.” Since stepping into an on-camera role two years ago, Gilliam, 24, appears every week in several short videos on Morning Brew’s social channels and has become a recognizable presence. “They'll comment things like, ‘Oh, I love when Macy does this,’ ‘Oh, Macy's always joking about that.’” This familiarity, she says, gives Morning Brew’s audience a stronger affinity for both the creator and the brand. Gilliam, who recently launched a new video franchise under the Morning Brew umbrella, believes introducing creator personalities on an outlet’s existing social channels benefits everyone: In-house influencers bring recognition, personality, and trustworthiness to the brand, creators get the company’s editorial support, and audiences get more engaging content. Talent-driven journalism does present many opportunities. But even as audience strategist Báez acknowledges the positives — news feels more personal, journalists connect directly with an audience, more accessibility, and the chance for people from underrepresented backgrounds to build their own following — she cautions that the practice also poses many challenges for journalists and news-seekers. First, Báez says, social media takes place on “borrowed land,” and is beholden to platforms with changing algorithms that generally deprioritize news. That makes it harder for outlets to ensure their coverage reaches the intended audiences, and for audiences to access the perspectives for which they’re searching. Additionally, Báez points out, not every journalist wants to be a public-facing personality. The shift toward news influencers favors extroverts over highly skilled journalists who do critical behind-the-scenes investigative work. It also increases the likelihood of harassment, burnout, and instability, especially for journalists from marginalized backgrounds. And, as with many shifts in media, this shift favors those who already have social capital, often white, male, well-connected voices, while others still struggle for visibility and support, she explains. Time will tell whether news organizations can invest in influencers to effectively benefit reporters and audiences alike. “Done right, it could strengthen journalism,” says Báez. “Done poorly, it could widen existing inequalities and destabilize an already fragile industry.”

More in the Cross Hall of the White House during an event on "Investing in America" on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump was joined by CEOs to highlight companies and their investments in the United States during the event. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its Q1 earnings towards the end of May. The consensus estimates earnings of $0.89 per share, reflecting a 45% increase from the previous year, while revenues are projected to rise by 65% year-over-year to $43 billion. This growth is expected to be fueled by sustained high demand for the company’s GPU chips utilized in generative AI applications. In the prior quarter, Nvidia reported having significantly increased the large-scale production of its latest Blackwell AI supercomputers. These new chips, equipped with advanced AI features and premium pricing, could potentially enhance top-line growth throughout Q1 FY’26 (FY’25 concluded in January 2025), while also improving margins. However, investors will keep a close eye on Nvidia’s future projections, especially given the growing uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policies and tariffs affecting key trading partners. The Trump administration is also considering tighter regulations on AI chip exports through newly introduced AI diffusion rules, which could represent a considerable threat to Nvidia’s long-term growth by restricting sales in crucial international markets. Separately, the past three years portend a 60% chance of a positive move, see: How Will D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) Stock React To Its Upcoming Earnings? Nvidia currently has a market capitalization of $2.7 trillion. Revenue over the previous twelve months amounted to $130 billion, alongside an operational profit of $81 billion and a net income of $73 billion. That said, for those seeking upside potential with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivering returns exceeding 91% since its inception. See earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. NVDA 1D, 5D, and 21D Post-Earnings Return A relatively less risky approach (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to examine the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair that exhibits the highest correlation, and execute the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the following 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data extracted from the 5-year and 3-year (more recent) historical performance. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA Correlation Between 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns At times, the performance of peers can impact the stock's reaction following earnings. In fact, the pricing in may commence prior to the earnings announcement. Here is some historical data comparing the post-earnings performance of Nvidia stock with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent one-day (1D) post-earnings returns. NVDA Correlation With Peer Earnings Discover more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), generating strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you are looking for upside potential with a smoother experience than an individual stock like Nvidia, consider the High Quality portfolio.

With almost $10 trillion in combined market cap across Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META), last week’s Big Tech earnings weren’t just dry corporate updates. They were market-moving events. And despite a few wobbles, the takeaway is clear: AI momentum and operational efficiency are driving a new wave of tech profitability, even as tariffs loom and economic uncertainty lingers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the widening gap between Wall Street and Main Street, the shift to AI-powered enterprise is shaping up as the gold rush of this decade. Microsoft led the charge, with the stock jumping more than 11% for the week, fueled by surging cloud and AI demand — and management’s clear, detailed take on both in the earnings call. Amazon, for its part, whipsawed before and after its earnings report, but closed the week up about 1%, buoyed by strong margin growth. Only Apple stock slipped, falling 2% as investors weighed a cautious June quarter outlook and a potential $900 million tariff hit. Together, the releases and earnings calls painted a nuanced but largely bullish picture of where Big Tech is headed — and how it’s already reshaping both the market and the macro narrative. If there was one company that seized the AI narrative last week, it was Microsoft. The company delivered a blowout quarter — and an even more confident call — that made clear it’s not just riding the AI boom, but helping define it. Azure cloud revenue grew 33% year-over-year, reaccelerating from the previous quarter and beating both internal targets and Wall Street estimates. Almost half of that growth came from AI workloads — a level of transparency that reinforced Microsoft’s clout in the enterprise AI stack. CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood leaned into the idea that AI and non-AI workloads are increasingly indistinguishable, especially among digital-native customers building everything on unified infrastructure. Microsoft’s $80 billion forecast for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures remains intact, with plans to expand further in 2026 — quieting any talk of a slowdown in data center investment. Wedbush called it an “Aaron Judge-like quarter” and raised its price target 8.4% to $515. Crucially, Microsoft didn’t just post strong results — it articulated a confident, forward-looking vision of how AI is already translating into revenue. In a week where every tech CEO had to tell an AI story, Microsoft made its pitch look not just polished, but inevitable. Amazon’s first-quarter results were strong by the numbers: Revenue rose 9% to $155.7 billion, net income rose to $1.59 per share, and operating margins hit a record 11.8%, largely on the back of AWS, Amazon’s profit engine. But with initiatives spanning AI chips, Alexa upgrades, Project Kuiper satellites, Prime Day savings on snail-mucin moisturizers, and even a new James Bond film, Amazon remains a catch-all for tech’s most ambitious threads — which may make its story harder to parse for investors. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized Amazon’s ability to thrive even in a softening economy, pointing to consumer demand strength, faster Prime delivery, and $500 million in customer savings during global sales events. He struck a confident tone on AWS as well, convincinly describing it as a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar” opportunity over time. Still, the cloud business grew just 17% year-over-year — solid, especially off a large base, but slower than Azure’s 33%, and short of the expectations that Microsoft’s blowout quarter had quietly raised. Analysts flagged uncertainty around near-term earnings power, as well as questions about potential tariff impacts and the timeline for Kuiper’s returns. As Deutsche Bank (DB) put it, Amazon’s sheer scale helps it weather global disruption — but that same sprawl can make it tough to gauge momentum or profitability with precision. AWS remains the largest cloud provider — a position it’s held for over a decade, a default authority — and management cited capacity constraints as a limiting factor, though relief may come in the second half of the year. Certainly, the stakes couldn’t be higher. As Jassy noted, we’re still in the early innings of enterprise’s move to the cloud — and that migration is accelerating, powered by AI. Enterprise tech may be the biggest market opportunity of this era, and in that context, “lumpy revenue” is both expected and fair. But with Microsoft setting the pace and reframing what success looks like, Amazon’s longtime dominance feels just a bit less assured. In the meantime, Amazon is betting that its everything-now strategy will pay off later. Of course, this isn’t a zero-sum game: The enterprise AI market is big enough to crown multiple winners, and both Microsoft and Amazon will undoubtedly be among the biggest. But in a moment where narrative clarity matters, Microsoft pulled ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: For GenZers working in clean energy, DOGE's cuts mean finding creative career pivots

In just four months, Aaron Yang's young career in renewable energy had hit the highs and lows you might expect of a more seasoned worker. Yang, 22, graduated from New York University in December and landed a job at the Department of Energy in an office doling out grants to nascent clean technologies like hydrogen, advanced nuclear, and long-duration battery storage. By April, he had been fired, rehired, and accepted a voluntary buyout under President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to shrink the federal government. Renewable energy programs were a top target, with Trump on January 20 signing an executive order freezing funding authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature climate law. Since then, thousands of federal employees working on clean energy, environmental justice, and climate science have been terminated. "Throughout college, I worked toward this career path," Yang told Business Insider in April at a career fair in Washington, DC. "Then I got into the DOE and felt that was a huge achievement. So to then immediately get laid off has been tough to reconcile." Yang is among many Gen Zers entering a job market defined by hiring slumps in industries like tech, finance, and consulting. The upheaval in Washington has further clouded their career paths, particularly in the renewable energy industry, as tariffs and frozen federal funding have led companies to delay new projects or scrap them altogether. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers cited Friday's strong jobs report to say that Trump was bringing jobs back "and making America the world's manufacturing powerhouse once again." A DOE spokesperson told Business Insider that the department was still reviewing its organizational structure to align with the president's priorities. "The American people provided President Trump with a mandate to govern and to unleash affordable, abundant, and secure American energy," they said, adding, "No final decisions have been made and multiple plans are still being considered." At a job fair during DC's inaugural Climate Week, more than 50 companies and trade associations met some 1,200 job seekers. They lined up to chat with firms including Amazon, the solar manufacturer Qcells, and Arcadia, an AI analytics platform for energy. Zainab Mirza organized the job fair for Clean Energy for America, a trade group that lobbies Congress and the administration on issues like protecting tax credits for renewable energy. Mirza experienced similar career setbacks as Yang. She graduated from American University in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, which thwarted her plans to pursue a career in international development overseas. In February, she was laid off from the DOE's Loan Program Office, where she had just become a full-time employee after being a contractor for two years. The slashed investments go beyond the federal government. In the first three months of 2025, companies canceled, closed, or downsized projects totaling nearly $8 billion in investment. This affected 16 new factories for electric vehicles, batteries, and hydrogen — more than three times the cancellation rate over the previous 30 months, according to an analysis by E2, a business group that advocates for clean energy, and the think tank Atlas Public Policy. "If this self-inflicted and unnecessary market uncertainty continues, we'll almost certainly see more projects paused, more construction halted, and more job opportunities disappear," Michael Timberlake, spokesperson for E2, said in a statement. Between January 2024 and March 2025, the number of new job postings across renewable power — including solar, wind, nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal — dropped by more than 20%, indicating a slowdown in labor demand, an analysis Revelio Labs conducted for BI showed. Some companies continue to invest in the energy transition. In March, 10 solar, EV, and transmission manufacturing plants were announced, which, if built, could create 5,000 permanent jobs. That includes Tesla's plans to build a battery factory near Houston. Despite the hurdles, Mirza was optimistic about the future. While the DOE is expected to be less active and shift away from wind and solar projects, it may help finance nuclear, geothermal, and power grid resilience. Katie Mehnert, CEO of ALLY Energy, an online career and networking platform, said the energy industry is always changing. Mehnert lives in Texas, where layoffs are also hitting the oil and gas sector. The rise of artificial intelligence is ushering in another transformation of how businesses operate. But there will be jobs, Mehnert said. ALLY recently partnered with Parallel, an AI-driven jobs platform that aims to make job hunting more efficient and better match people's expertise to openings. "We need more energy, we need sustainable energy, we need affordable energy," Mehnert said. "And there's plenty of money that's been deployed. Now we need to find the best talent and match them with opportunities quicker. That way, we can minimize the disruption in job marketing and people's personal lives." Mirza, for her part, encouraged young people to be open-minded to positions they may not have considered. "I'm not sure where I want to go next," Mirza said. "I've had a blast putting this event together. I think that people here can meet with employers they might not have heard of or thought about, or a skill that they haven't developed. There are upskilling opportunities. There are incubators. Maybe you've had an idea for so long, and now you can test it out." Yang said he's open-minded, too. Although his time at DOE was focused on long-duration energy storage like batteries, he is open to other technologies. During his undergrad internships, Yang worked on transmission infrastructure, sales teams, and policy development. For now, Yang decided to accelerate his pursuit of a master's in energy, policy, and climate at Johns Hopkins University while looking for a full time job. He's come close several times, but ultimately, someone with more experience was hired. "That's no fault of my own," Yang said. "There are a ton of talented people out there right now, and I haven't worked full-time yet. So I'm cautiously optimistic. I don't know what my future holds." Do you have a story to share?

Title: Market Mayhem and Recovery: Wall Street’s Wild Ride in 2025

On April 2, President Trump stunned the markets by announcing unexpectedly steep tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners. The reaction was swift and severe — the S&P 500 plummeted nearly 12%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 4,600 points in just four days. The sudden escalation raised fears that Trump was willing to risk a recession to reshape the global trade landscape.(Source: AP) Despite the initial crash, the U.S. stock market began to recover quickly. By early May, the S&P 500 had climbed back to the levels seen on April 2. While still over 7% below its all-time high, the market’s rapid bounce-back was just as unexpected and dramatic as the fall that preceded it. A major turning point came on April 9 when Trump announced a “90-day PAUSE” on most tariffs, excluding those targeting China. This announcement led to a massive one-day rally, with the S&P 500 jumping 9.5% — one of its best performances ever. However, controversy followed as Trump had posted on Truth Social earlier that day calling it a “great time to buy,” raising questions about timing and market influence. Following the pause, the market saw a mix of optimism and confusion. Trump spoke about both negotiating and enforcing tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., a seemingly contradictory stance. Still, signs of easing tensions, particularly with China, and the reduction of tariffs on cars and consumer electronics helped calm some investor nerves. The sharp stock selloff after "Liberation Day" also shook other financial markets. U.S. Treasury bond prices fell, and the dollar weakened, reflecting a loss of investor confidence in America’s financial safety. Trump himself acknowledged that bond market jitters contributed to his decision to delay tariffs, as investors grew increasingly uneasy. Despite shaken consumer confidence, economic data painted a stronger picture. April saw 177,000 new jobs added, supporting the view that the economy remained resilient. The Federal Reserve, which had already cut rates three times in late 2024, chose to hold steady, watching the evolving impact of trade policy. Nonetheless, markets continue to price in the likelihood of three more cuts by year-end. Even amid uncertainty, U.S. companies have posted surprisingly strong earnings. Nearly 75% of S&P 500 firms, including giants like Microsoft and Meta, beat profit expectations, with overall earnings growth nearing 13%. However, many CEOs are hesitant about the future, offering cautious or dual forecasts — as United Airlines did — due to unpredictable trade policies. With the tariff pause nearing expiration, volatility could return swiftly if no lasting agreements are reached.

Title: The Oracle of Omaha Steps Down

After over six decades at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, the end of this year marks the finale: Investment legend Warren Buffett is stepping down. Buffett weathered market storms and geopolitical turbulence by translating the Bretton Woods order into a consistent portfolio strategy. As always, it was business as usual: Around 20,000 Berkshire shareholders filled the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, to capacity -- the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders’ meeting was underway. Known in investment circles as the “Woodstock” of investors, the event traditionally unfolds as a whirlwind tour through the American economy. The accompanying exhibition of Berkshire’s investments showcases what resonates with American consumers: Apple, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, or American Express -- a veritable trade show of national brand leaders. Here, retail and institutional investors alike are reassured that Omaha remains true to its roots: conservative, grounded, quintessentially American, and always in tune with the consumer. This strategy has been managed from Berkshire’s headquarters at Blackstone Plaza. This approach has propelled Berkshire’s stock to a staggering 4.4 million percent increase since its transformation from a textile company into an investment fund in 1962. The never-split original share recently hit a price of $800,000 -- a figure worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. By comparison, the broad S&P 500 index “only” grew by 31,000 percent over the same period. A Routine with a Bombshell Let’s pause the number games and return to Omaha. Attendees of the shareholders’ meeting on May 3, 2025, quickly realized they were witnessing a turning point: At 94, Warren Buffett announced his resignation as chairman. By year’s end, 62-year-old Canadian Greg Abel, currently vice chairman for non-insurance operations, will take the reins. This will take some getting used to, as Buffett is a stock market institution, a calming force in the frenetic world of Wall Street, from which he maintained a safe distance -- not just geographically, with his base in far-off Nebraska. Buffett shaped the investment landscape like few others over his 63-year tenure. His strategy was clear-cut: a heavy focus on equity investments in U.S. market leaders, almost entirely eschewing bonds, and aligning the fund’s cash position with the waves of the credit cycle. Berkshire cashed out investments when strategically prudent or when the economy’s credit engine overheated. This disciplined oscillation between U.S. dollar reserves and aggressive equity buildups after market corrections has outperformed the classic 60/40 stock-bond portfolio by leaps and bounds. A deep understanding of economic cycles, industry growth, and specific company valuations forged an unbeatable alliance that turned countless loyal shareholders into millionaires. Embedded in the Bretton Woods Framework With an estimated fortune of $160 billion, Buffett, the world’s fifth-richest person, remained true to himself. His conservative investment style is mirrored in his personal life: no scandals, three children from two marriages, and he still lives in the Omaha house he bought in 1958. In soccer terms, his strategy might be called a “controlled offensive.” Buffett’s investment thesis was rooted in the post-war Bretton Woods order, betting on the dominant U.S. market -- and he was spot-on. The U.S. dollar’s dominance remains unbroken, still a safe-haven currency in crises. U.S. companies like Apple, Domino’s Pizza, or Chevron lead their market segments, aided by a U.S. regulatory framework that welcomes foreign capital with open arms. In short, Buffett’s framework: Capital is mobile, the U.S. offers an open market system combining liquidity and growth, and the domestic currency, as a cash buffer, never faced serious devaluation risks compared to global competitors. This stability was underpinned by decades of U.S. interventionist foreign policy, leaving no room for doubt. Berkshire became a meta-investment structure, enabling retail investors to back the U.S. market as a whole through government-backed stock ownership programs. Monetary Policy as a Multiplier Berkshire also capitalized on another insight: Investment success hinges not only on analysis but also on systemic factors. These lie in the design of the global monetary order. With the end of the gold standard in 1971 (Nixon Shock), global credit creation accelerated. Since then, the global money supply (M2 -- cash, checking deposits, and short-term savings) has grown by an average of 6.9% annually. The fiat standard -- credit creation without full backing by assets like gold or commodities -- unleashed waves of liquidity. These inflated nominal asset valuations, turning assets like real estate into “savings banks” to preserve purchasing power against currency devaluation. Buffett recognized this liquidity mechanism, effectively “front-running” the money-printing machine with his investment style. A New Investment Regime The handover comes amid significant geopolitical upheaval. With his tariff push, U.S. President Donald Trump has exposed a long-simmering issue: a crisis in U.S. Treasuries as a globally accepted safe asset. Markets are now pricing new risk premiums into asset classes. Volatility is rising, and governments, central banks, and major capital pools are increasingly eyeing safe-haven assets like gold and Bitcoin. Capital rotation into these assets reflects efforts to reduce credit default risks, which lurk like a ticking time bomb under traditional portfolio structures. How will Berkshire Hathaway navigate geopolitical uncertainty and inflation risks? During the COVID lockdowns and expansive monetary policy, Buffett foresaw rising inflation and briefly positioned Berkshire in the gold sector, investing in Barrick Gold in 2020 -- a notable move for the traditionally gold-skeptical Buffett. Yet, by Q4 of that year, the firm exited the position. This brief gold foray and swift retreat seem, in hindsight, like an acknowledgment of an emerging monetary system crisis. However, Buffett’s team may have been reluctant to admit that a radical devaluation of dollar collateral -- a potential regime change -- was already underway. Will Berkshire steer toward safe havens? The question looms: How will the new leadership under Greg Abel handle safe-haven assets in a shifting global landscape? Will Omaha continue to bet on U.S. policy’s ability to consolidate budgets and fiscal frameworks in the spirit of free markets? And will it trust in a U.S. economic comeback under President Trump? Financial analysts, media, and policymakers will closely watch the strategic decisions of Berkshire’s new leadership. For Berkshire’s over one million shareholders worldwide, Buffett’s exit marks the start of a new chapter, fueled by hope that the controlled offensive that made the firm strong will succeed in the evolving financial world. The meeting closed with a cryptic remark from the Oracle of Omaha. Commenting on recent trade policy developments and current crises, Buffett hinted: “It may be that things happen in the United States that cause us to own a lot of other currencies.” Time will tell how this pointed warning will manifest in Berkshire’s portfolio in the months ahead. Image: USA International Trade Administration After over six decades at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, the end of this year marks the finale: Investment legend Warren Buffett is stepping down. Buffett weathered market storms and geopolitical turbulence by translating the Bretton Woods order into a consistent portfolio strategy. As always, it was business as usual: Around 20,000 Berkshire shareholders filled the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, to capacity -- the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders’ meeting was underway. Known in investment circles as the “Woodstock” of investors, the event traditionally unfolds as a whirlwind tour through the American economy. The accompanying exhibition of Berkshire’s investments showcases what resonates with American consumers: Apple, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, or American Express -- a veritable trade show of national brand leaders. Here, retail and institutional investors alike are reassured that Omaha remains true to its roots: conservative, grounded, quintessentially American, and always in tune with the consumer. This strategy has been managed from Berkshire’s headquarters at Blackstone Plaza. This approach has propelled Berkshire’s stock to a staggering 4.4 million percent increase since its transformation from a textile company into an investment fund in 1962. The never-split original share recently hit a price of $800,000 -- a figure worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. By comparison, the broad S&P 500 index “only” grew by 31,000 percent over the same period. A Routine with a Bombshell Let’s pause the number games and return to Omaha. Attendees of the shareholders’ meeting on May 3, 2025, quickly realized they were witnessing a turning point: At 94, Warren Buffett announced his resignation as chairman. By year’s end, 62-year-old Canadian Greg Abel, currently vice chairman for non-insurance operations, will take the reins. This will take some getting used to, as Buffett is a stock market institution, a calming force in the frenetic world of Wall Street, from which he maintained a safe distance -- not just geographically, with his base in far-off Nebraska. Buffett shaped the investment landscape like few others over his 63-year tenure. His strategy was clear-cut: a heavy focus on equity investments in U.S. market leaders, almost entirely eschewing bonds, and aligning the fund’s cash position with the waves of the credit cycle. Berkshire cashed out investments when strategically prudent or when the economy’s credit engine overheated. This disciplined oscillation between U.S. dollar reserves and aggressive equity buildups after market corrections has outperformed the classic 60/40 stock-bond portfolio by leaps and bounds. A deep understanding of economic cycles, industry growth, and specific company valuations forged an unbeatable alliance that turned countless loyal shareholders into millionaires. Embedded in the Bretton Woods Framework With an estimated fortune of $160 billion, Buffett, the world’s fifth-richest person, remained true to himself. His conservative investment style is mirrored in his personal life: no scandals, three children from two marriages, and he still lives in the Omaha house he bought in 1958. In soccer terms, his strategy might be called a “controlled offensive.” Buffett’s investment thesis was rooted in the post-war Bretton Woods order, betting on the dominant U.S. market -- and he was spot-on. The U.S. dollar’s dominance remains unbroken, still a safe-haven currency in crises. U.S. companies like Apple, Domino’s Pizza, or Chevron lead their market segments, aided by a U.S. regulatory framework that welcomes foreign capital with open arms. In short, Buffett’s framework: Capital is mobile, the U.S. offers an open market system combining liquidity and growth, and the domestic currency, as a cash buffer, never faced serious devaluation risks compared to global competitors. This stability was underpinned by decades of U.S. interventionist foreign policy, leaving no room for doubt. Berkshire became a meta-investment structure, enabling retail investors to back the U.S. market as a whole through government-backed stock ownership programs. Monetary Policy as a Multiplier Berkshire also capitalized on another insight: Investment success hinges not only on analysis but also on systemic factors. These lie in the design of the global monetary order. With the end of the gold standard in 1971 (Nixon Shock), global credit creation accelerated. Since then, the global money supply (M2 -- cash, checking deposits, and short-term savings) has grown by an average of 6.9% annually. The fiat standard -- credit creation without full backing by assets like gold or commodities -- unleashed waves of liquidity. These inflated nominal asset valuations, turning assets like real estate into “savings banks” to preserve purchasing power against currency devaluation.

Beyond tariffs and earnings, the big event will be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Markets ... More expect no rate changes from the Federal Reserve. The focus will be on Chair Powell’s comments and whether June is a likely time to lower rates again. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) After the busiest week of earnings releases, almost three-quarters of companies have released results. 76% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. This earnings season slows this week, with 93 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. In addition to earnings, the Federal Reserve (Fed) meets on Wednesday. S&P 500 Earnings Season According to FactSet data, the healthcare, consumer discretionary, communication services, and technology sectors contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is 12.8% year-over-year, above the 7.2% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings and sales growth rates for calendar years 2025 and 2026 have declined despite the better-than-expected first-quarter results so far. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Better tariff news combined with strong earnings sent stocks higher by 2.9% last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 7.5% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. The group is 17% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Total Returns Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and account for a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week, and all but Amazon outperformed expectations. While Amazon came up short, the earnings pace was robust, and the stock was still higher for the week. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. Nvidia (NVDA) is the last of the magnificent 7 stocks yet to report and is not expected until the end of May. Magnificent 7 Earnings Beyond the Magnificent 7, this week of the reporting season has some notable companies scheduled, including Clorox (CLX), Uber Technologies (UBER), Emerson Electric (EMR), and Walt Disney (DIS). Earnings Insights By Sector According to FactSet data, the healthcare, consumer discretionary, communication services, and technology sectors were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings. It was a broad-based improvement in earnings as every sector except energy saw better earnings growth rates last week. Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.8% is above the 4.4% expectations. The technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Sales Growth By Sector As discussed in a previous piece, a surge in imports was a massive headwind to GDP growth. Net exports were a whopping 4.8 percentage point drag on the economy. According to Goldman Sachs, this is the most significant drag from net exports on record as companies raced to import goods to avoid the coming tariffs. GDP Components Due to the trade distortion, final sales to private domestic purchasers are a better measure to watch, and they continued to perform well at 3% growth. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the U.S. private sector. Measures Of Economic Activity Monthly nonfarm payrolls grew by an above-consensus 177,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Despite the 58,000 downward revision of payroll jobs over the previous months, the monthly jobs report has to be considered solid. Monthly Jobs Report The GDP report, especially when combined with the monthly jobs growth, does not signal an imminent recession despite the -0.3% decline in headline economic activity. This does not mean that we won’t eventually see more economic slowing due to tariffs, but this isn’t it yet. Consumer spending did moderate somewhat, so it is still fair to say the economy was softening a bit even before the tariff impact. Markets will remain very attuned to newsflow around the tariffs since the size and duration of the tariffs impact the extent of the economic growth headwind. Beyond tariffs, the big event will be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Markets expect no rate changes from the Federal Reserve, especially after the better-than-expected jobs report. The focus will be on Chair Powell’s comments and whether June is a likely time to lower rates again. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Despite the negative GDP results for the first quarter, the economy is not in a recession. This view is further bolstered by the better-than-expected job growth reported last week. The Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) annual meeting and first quarter earnings release on Saturday were eventful. Warren Buffett shocked the crowd with the announcement that he plans to resign from his role as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at year-end. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

May 04, 2025 08:47 ET | Source: Nitric Boost Nitric Boost NEW YORK, May 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- If you’re searching for the best nitric oxide supplements for men, you're not alone. In 2025, nitric oxide (NO) boosters are among the most in-demand health products for men looking to enhance blood flow, energy, athletic performance, and even support for erectile dysfunction (ED). But what exactly is nitric oxide, and why does it matter so much? Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring molecule in your body that plays a crucial role in vascular health. It helps relax and dilate blood vessels, allowing for improved circulation—a function that impacts everything from your stamina at the gym to your performance in the bedroom. Unfortunately, as men age, natural NO production declines, often leading to fatigue, reduced endurance, poor muscle recovery, and even symptoms of ED. That’s where nitric oxide supplements come in. Designed to stimulate NO production through ingredients like L-arginine, L-citrulline, and beetroot extract, these supplements help improve oxygen delivery, nutrient flow, and vascular function. Whether you're an athlete chasing better pumps or someone looking to restore youthful energy and performance, the right nitric oxide booster can make a major difference. And among the dozens of options on the market, one supplement continues to lead the pack in 2025… Enter: Nitric Boost Ultra — a cutting-edge NO supplement formulated for maximum blood flow, energy, and erectile support. This guide explores the science behind nitric oxide, the benefits it delivers for men’s health, and why Nitric Boost Ultra stands out as the best nitric oxide supplement for energy, endurance, and ED support this year. Meet Nitric Boost Ultra – The Best Nitric Oxide Supplement for Men When it comes to choosing the best nitric oxide supplement for men, Nitric Boost Ultra consistently ranks as the top choice in 2025. This advanced formula is specifically engineered to support optimal blood flow, muscle pumps, stamina, and erectile health — making it a powerful ally for any man looking to reclaim energy, confidence, and vitality. Why Nitric Boost Ultra Stands Out Unlike generic NO boosters, Nitric Boost Ultra goes beyond basic L-arginine formulas. It’s designed with a synergistic blend of science-backed ingredients that work together to enhance nitric oxide production, increase oxygen delivery, and improve vascular performance without the crash or jitteriness often associated with stimulant-heavy products. Key Benefits at a Glance: Who It’s For: Nitric Boost Ultra is ideal for: Whether your goals are better performance in the gym, the bedroom, or day-to-day life, Nitric Boost Ultra delivers noticeable results — quickly and without side effects. Ingredients in Nitric Boost Ultra – Why They Matter What sets Nitric Boost Ultra apart from the rest of the best nitric oxide supplements for men is its clean, clinically-informed formula that zeroes in on blood flow, stamina, and vascular performance. Each ingredient has a specific role in increasing nitric oxide levels, improving erectile function, and enhancing overall male vitality. L-Arginine Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AAKG) Primary Function: Boosts nitric oxide synthesisAAKG is a potent form of L-arginine combined with alpha-ketoglutarate, allowing for better absorption and sustained nitric oxide production. It helps dilate blood vessels, improve circulation, and promote stronger erections and muscle pumps. L-Citrulline Malate Primary Function: Extends nitric oxide boost durationL-Citrulline converts to L-arginine in the body and provides a longer-lasting nitric oxide effect.

Beetroot extract supports cardiovascular health, reduces blood pressure, and enhances stamina, making it a key ingredient for both gym-goers and those seeking better sexual performance. Tribulus Terrestris Primary Function: Supports testosterone and libidoThis herbal extract may help boost natural testosterone levels, which can enhance libido, energy, and muscle strength. When paired with improved blood flow, it amplifies both sexual and athletic performance. Pine Bark Extract (Pycnogenol) Primary Function: Enhances nitric oxide retentionKnown for its antioxidant properties, pine bark extract helps sustain nitric oxide levels in the blood longer, leading to better vascular tone, improved erectile quality, and faster post-exercise recovery. Niacin (Vitamin B3) Primary Function: Improves blood vessel flexibilityNiacin supports vascular health by reducing inflammation and improving blood lipid profiles. It works synergistically with the other ingredients to optimize circulation and reduce fatigue. Why This Blend Works: This unique combination addresses every aspect of nitric oxide production and utilization — from boosting initial levels to sustaining them longer and improving blood vessel responsiveness. Whether you’re battling low energy, erectile dysfunction, or sluggish recovery, Nitric Boost Ultra helps restore male performance at its core.

Try it today! How Nitric Oxide Works – The Science Behind NO Boosters Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally occurring molecule in the human body, essential for many physiological processes — especially those tied to circulation, energy, and male performance. Understanding how nitric oxide works helps explain why supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra have become the go-to solution for men looking to improve stamina, blood flow, and even erectile dysfunction (ED). What Is Nitric Oxide (NO)? Nitric oxide is a vasodilator — a compound that signals blood vessels to relax and widen. This increased vessel diameter allows more blood, oxygen, and nutrients to flow to vital areas of the body. NO is synthesized from amino acids like L-Arginine and L-Citrulline and is crucial for: How Nitric Oxide Boosters Work Nitric oxide supplements — like Nitric Boost Ultra — work by supplying the body with precursors that stimulate NO production naturally. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works: 1. L-Arginine & L-Citrulline These amino acids are converted into nitric oxide via the endothelial cells lining your blood vessels. This process leads to: 2. Beet Root & Other Plant-Based Boosters Beetroot is rich in nitrates, which convert into nitric oxide through a different pathway — the nitrate-nitrite-NO cycle. This dual approach provides: 3. Synergistic Support from Key Vitamins & Botanicals Ingredients like Niacin (Vitamin B3) help relax blood vessels and improve lipid profiles, while herbs like Tribulus Terrestris and Pine Bark Extract boost natural testosterone and enhance libido — making NO boosters even more effective for male sexual health. Fast-Acting, Long-Lasting Results Once taken, NO boosters quickly absorb into the bloodstream and start enhancing circulation within hours. Over time, consistent use: Nitric Boost Ultra works on all these mechanisms, making it one of the top-rated nitric oxide supplements for men who want to optimize blood flow, muscle function, and sexual performance without pharmaceuticals or side effects. Clinical Studies Supporting Nitric Oxide Supplementation 1. L-Citrulline and Erectile Function A study published in Urology investigated the effects of oral L-citrulline supplementation on men with mild erectile dysfunction (ED). In this single-blind study, participants received a placebo for one month followed by L-citrulline (1.5 g/day) for another month. The results showed that 50% of the men experienced an improvement in erection hardness from a score of 3 (mild ED) to 4 (normal erectile function) during the L-citrulline phase, compared to only 8.3% during the placebo phase. Additionally, the mean number of intercourses per month increased significantly with L-citrulline supplementation. Another study explored the combination of L-citrulline and transresveratrol in men with ED who were already using phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot study found that the combination therapy significantly improved erectile function compared to placebo, suggesting a potential synergistic effect. 2. Beetroot Juice and Blood Pressure A systematic review and meta-analysis examined the impact of nitrate-rich beetroot juice on blood pressure in individuals with arterial hypertension. The analysis included seven studies with a total of 218 participants. The findings indicated that beetroot juice supplementation led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) by approximately 4.95 mmHg. However, the effect on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was not statistically significant. Another study focused on the acute and short-term effects of nitrate-rich beetroot juice ingestion in postmenopausal women with arterial hypertension. The results demonstrated that both acute and one-week supplementation enhanced cardiovascular responses following aerobic exercise, highlighting the potential benefits of beetroot juice in this population. Nitric Boost Ultra vs Other Top Nitric Oxide Supplements When it comes to nitric oxide supplements, not all formulas are created equal. While many products claim to boost nitric oxide levels, only a few deliver clinically effective doses, proven ingredients, and measurable results. Here's how Nitric Boost Ultra compares head-to-head with other top-rated nitric oxide boosters in the market. Ingredients & Clinical Doses Nitric Boost Ultra stands out for including clinically validated doses of L-Arginine and L-Citrulline, the two most important amino acids involved in nitric oxide synthesis. Unlike other products that use proprietary blends or underdose key ingredients, Nitric Boost Ultra clearly lists: Most competitors—like SuperBeets or Neo40—rely heavily on beetroot alone, without the dual-action benefits of arginine + citrulline. Pre-workout formulas like N.O. XT may include these aminos but often at lower or less bioavailable doses. Delivery Method Nitric Boost Ultra is delivered in easy-to-swallow capsules, optimized for gradual absorption and longer-lasting effects. This method avoids the rapid spike and crash often experienced with lozenges, powders, or sugary beet-based drinks. Nitric Boost Ultra's capsule format ensures no mess, no mixing, and no blood sugar spikes—just smooth, consistent nitric oxide support throughout the day. Third-Party Testing & Purity Purity and transparency are key when choosing a top nitric oxide booster. Nitric Boost Ultra is: Many other brands skip third-party testing or hide their ingredient doses behind proprietary blends. With Nitric Boost Ultra, what you see is what you get—no fillers, no gimmicks. Price vs. Value While some nitric oxide supplements may seem cheaper upfront, they often cut corners on ingredient quality or dosing. Nitric Boost Ultra offers premium ingredients, clinical dosing, and a comprehensive formula that supports: And all of this is backed by a 60-day money-back guarantee—making it a risk-free investment in your health. Bottom Line: Why Nitric Boost Ultra Leads the Pack If you’re seeking the best nitric oxide supplement for men’s health, especially for ED support, energy, and peak performance, Nitric Boost Ultra delivers where others fall short. With clinical dosing, clean formulation, and proven ingredients, it’s engineered for real results—not just hype. Order Nitric Boost Ultra now and experience the nitric oxide difference Health Benefits of Nitric Oxide Supplements for Men When it comes to men’s health, few compounds are as impactful as nitric oxide (NO). As a key signaling molecule, NO plays a vital role in blood vessel dilation, oxygen delivery, cellular energy, and hormone regulation. The best nitric oxide supplements for men, like Nitric Boost Ultra, are formulated to elevate your performance in all areas — from the gym to the bedroom. Here are the top science-backed health benefits: 1. Enhanced Blood Flow & Circulation The #1 benefit of nitric oxide supplements is vasodilation — the widening of blood vessels. This leads to: When blood flows more freely, every system in the body works more efficiently. 2. Erectile Dysfunction Support Nitric oxide is essential for achieving and maintaining an erection. In fact, it’s the same mechanism targeted by ED medications: This makes NO boosters like Nitric Boost Ultra one of the best nitric oxide supplements for ED available today. 3. Improved Athletic Performance & Muscle Pump Whether you're a professional athlete or just hitting the gym, nitric oxide can significantly boost your performance: The combination of L-Citrulline and Beetroot in Nitric Boost Ultra makes it ideal for men looking to train harder and recover faster. 4.

Feel stronger, think clearer, and live better — take charge of your health with Nitric Boost Ultra today. Nitric Oxide Benefits for Males – Why It Matters Most After 40 As men age, their bodies experience a gradual decline in nitric oxide (NO) production — a key molecule that affects everything from blood circulation to sexual health, muscle performance, and even heart function. By the time you reach 40 and beyond, this drop in NO can begin to show up in ways that directly impact your quality of life. That’s where nitric oxide supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra come in. These boosters are specifically designed to replenish NO levels and restore youthful performance across multiple health areas. 1. Improved Erectile Function and Sexual Vitality One of the most talked-about nitric oxide benefits for males is its direct link to stronger, longer-lasting erections. NO relaxes blood vessels and improves blood flow — a critical factor in achieving and maintaining erections. Men over 40 often experience ED or performance issues not due to lack of desire, but because blood flow is compromised. A high-quality nitric oxide booster for ED, such as Nitric Boost Ultra: This makes nitric oxide one of the best natural alternatives to ED medications — without harsh side effects. 2. Cardiovascular Health and Blood Pressure Support After 40, men are more susceptible to hypertension, heart disease, and circulatory issues. Since nitric oxide plays a key role in vasodilation (the widening of blood vessels), boosting NO levels can: Regular use of nitric oxide supplements has been associated with better heart performance and lower vascular resistance, helping you age with strength and resilience. 3. Enhanced Physical Performance and Muscle Recovery Whether you’re staying fit or just trying to keep up with your kids, muscle fatigue becomes more noticeable after 40. Nitric oxide helps: By improving circulation and oxygen delivery, NO boosters like Nitric Boost Ultra are perfect for maintaining strength and physical ability well into your 40s, 50s, and beyond. 4. Cognitive Function and Mental Sharpness The gut-brain axis and circulatory function also play a huge role in how you think and feel. As NO supports blood flow to the brain, it can improve: This is particularly helpful for aging men juggling careers, families, and health — NO supplements are a hidden gem in natural cognitive support. 5. Energy and Anti-Aging Effects Fatigue and slowed metabolism are common complaints after 40. By supporting mitochondrial efficiency and cellular energy production, nitric oxide helps: The anti-aging effects of nitric oxide go beyond the surface — they’re about staying functional, vibrant, and energized every single day. Why Nitric Boost Ultra Is Ideal for Men 40+ What makes Nitric Boost Ultra a standout choice for men over 40 is its clean, high-impact formulation: Nitric Oxide Side Effects – What You Should Know Before Taking a NO Booster As nitric oxide supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra continue gaining popularity for blood flow support, workout enhancement, and ED relief, it’s essential to understand the potential side effects and how to use them safely. While most people tolerate nitric oxide boosters well, being informed ensures you can maximize the benefits without unwanted surprises. Are There Any Common Side Effects? Generally, natural nitric oxide supplements are considered safe for healthy adults when taken as directed. However, some individuals may experience mild side effects, particularly when first starting or when taking high doses. Possible side effects may include: These effects are usually temporary and tend to subside as the body adjusts. What Causes These Side Effects? Most side effects stem from the vasodilation process, where blood vessels widen due to increased nitric oxide. This can lead to changes in blood pressure or temporary shifts in circulation. Stimulant-free formulas like Nitric Boost Ultra, which uses natural vasodilators (L-arginine, beetroot, pine bark), are generally easier on the body compared to synthetic or caffeine-loaded options. How to Minimize Risk To enjoy the benefits of nitric oxide safely, follow these guidelines: If you have a pre-existing heart condition or are on blood pressure medications, consult a physician before starting any nitric oxide booster. Who Should Be Cautious? Although NO supplements for men offer amazing benefits, they may not be suitable for: Nitric Boost Ultra is non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, and made with clinically backed ingredients, which significantly reduces the risk of allergic reactions or sensitivities. Final Thoughts on Safety Used correctly, nitric oxide supplements are a powerful tool to enhance your performance, health, and energy. With its balanced, stimulant-free formula, Nitric Boost Ultra is designed for daily use without harsh side effects. Still, listening to your body and adjusting as needed is key to a safe and satisfying NO supplement experience. Experience clean, science-backed blood flow support — without the jitters or crashes. Try Nitric Boost Ultra today and feel the natural difference. FAQs About Nitric Oxide Supplements and Nitric Boost Ultra Curious about how nitric oxide supplements work, whether they’re safe, or how they can help you boost performance and wellness? Below are some of the most frequently asked questions about Nitric Boost Ultra and nitric oxide (NO) boosters in general. 1. How fast does Nitric Boost Ultra work? Most users report feeling initial effects such as improved energy, endurance, or better pumps within the first 30 to 60 minutes of taking Nitric Boost Ultra. Long-term benefits like improved blood flow, stamina, and erectile support may take 2–4 weeks of consistent use. 2. Is Nitric Boost Ultra safe for daily use? Yes. Nitric Boost Ultra uses natural ingredients like L-arginine, beetroot extract, and pine bark, which are generally safe and well-tolerated. It’s stimulant-free and designed for regular daily use without harsh side effects. Still, consult your doctor if you have pre-existing health conditions or are on medication. 3.

Many men use Nitric Boost Ultra to improve sexual performance, stamina, and natural arousal. 5. Do nitric oxide supplements cause high blood pressure? Quite the opposite.

Title: GoDaddy CEO: Focus On Innovation and Customers and The Rest Takes Care of Itself
URL: https://www.webpronews.com/godaddy-ceo-focus-on-innovation-and-customers-and-the-rest-takes-care-of-itself/
Time Published: 2025-05-04T10:04:30Z

In a climate of growing scrutiny over digital businesses, GoDaddy Inc. delivered what CEO Aman Bhutani described as “a very strong quarter,” posting results that beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom line for its first quarter of 2024. Yet, despite the solid quarterly performance and reaffirmed full-year outlook, concerns persist among investors and analysts about the sustainability of GoDaddy’s growth, especially against a backcloth of economic headwinds and wavering consumer sentiment. “We beat across all financial metrics in Q1. So a very strong quarter for us. And we reaffirmed our full-year guidance,” Bhutani told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” in an exclusive interview. “Our customers are resilient. Our business is durable. I’ve never been more excited about being at GoDaddy.” GoDaddy’s financial highlights for the quarter included better-than-expected revenue and earnings per share, supported by ongoing demand for the company’s suite of digital tools enabling small businesses and entrepreneurs to establish an online presence. But the company’s shares have come under pressure, sliding in the wake of the report as market participants voiced concerns about underlying trends in customer growth and dependency on price hikes for revenue expansion. Analyst Queries Over Customer Dynamics A number of analysts questioned the optics around declining customer counts and whether increases in average order size or “attach rate”—the number of products per customer—can sustainably drive revenue growth in a competitive and sensitive marketplace. “One analyst has pointed out that the optics are that customer count is coming down. There’s a narrative out there that price drove most of the growth in 2024. And there are questions about whether it’s sustainable this year,” said CNBC host John Fortt. Bhutani responded by shifting the focus from absolute customer numbers to the quality and depth of GoDaddy’s customer relationships. “The idea is to bring high intent customers to GoDaddy, not folks who are looking to buy a cheap domain and then not renew or buy any of our other products,” he said. “We’ve really expanded the product suite over the last few years. We want customers that want to use the breadth of products, and that’s what we’re seeing. We’re seeing increased average order size, improved retention rates, and customers using more of our products.” GoDaddy has been investing in product innovation, including the recent launch of Aero, an AI-powered solution designed to help clients quickly access the full spectrum of GoDaddy’s offerings, from domain registration and website design to e-commerce, digital marketing, and payments. Small Businesses: A Barometer for Economic Mood As a linchpin for millions of small business owners and entrepreneurs, GoDaddy’s performance provides a unique window into the mindset of Main Street businesses—often the first to feel the chill of a softening economy but also the first to rebound when optimism returns. The company conducts regular surveys with its customer base, which Bhutani said gives the company “real-time” insight. “There’s a little bit more tentativeness from our customers on the broader economy. But the core story has not changed, and that story is about our customer being resilient,” Bhutani said. “When we ask them about the economy, yes, they’re a little more concerned, but when we ask them about their business, the majority of them continue to be very bullish about their business.” Industry observers note that GoDaddy operates at a critical juncture for small businesses, many of which rely on the company’s low-cost and essential digital infrastructure. “Our customers need us most for marketing,” Bhutani explained. “A domain name, a website, a little email solution, or just a link to take payments…these are the solutions that are going to be the last things customers give up.” That stickiness, he argued, works in GoDaddy’s favor even in downturns. “Even when a business goes down, a customer doesn’t get rid of their domain name. They’re not giving up the dream,” Bhutani said. “They’re going to keep going and try it again or try something different.” Competitive Positioning Amid Digital Heavyweights Even as GoDaddy faces its usual competition from hosting and web development rivals, broader industry trends are shaping its trajectory. The digital tools segment has been lifted by surging demand for online marketing and commerce solutions; tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google reported robust advertising growth in their latest quarters, reflecting businesses’ increased willingness to optimize digital spending, even amid economic uncertainty. Amazon’s advertising revenue, for instance, rose 90% year-over-year. Asked how GoDaddy fits into this bigger digital transformation, Bhutani outlined an effort to expand beyond core domain registration into “marketing solutions and commerce solutions.” The company’s newest products are designed to capture a greater share of its customers’ digital spending, with lower overall prices and added value for switching or consolidating services. “We’ve got more and more offerings like marketing solutions and commerce solutions as well,” Bhutani said, hinting at a strategy to position GoDaddy not simply as a domain registrar, but as a one-stop digital partner for small businesses. Stock Under Pressure, But Focus Remains on Execution Despite the strategic narrative and the company’s recent investments, GoDaddy stock remains under pressure. Analysts appear unconvinced that product attach and average revenue per user will be enough to drive sustained growth in the event of waning new customer acquisitions—especially in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Bhutani, for his part, remains focused on execution. “My view is let’s focus on the things that we do. Let’s focus on the innovation. Let’s focus on serving our customers. And the rest takes care of itself,” he concluded. He maintains confidence that share price will eventually reflect what the company sees as underlying business strength and resiliency among its core customer base. For now, GoDaddy will be measured less by the hype that once defined the digital domain industry and more by its ability to deepen and lengthen relationships with existing clients—many of whom, in Bhutani’s words, are “not giving up the dream” even in challenging times.

After blockbuster earnings last week from Big Tech, capped by Apple (AAPL-0.39%), Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), and a weekend of Buffett wisdom at Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.A-0.82%) annual meeting, markets are still digesting what it all means. The Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq are rallying, but Main Street signals remain mixed, and inflation, tariffs, and consumer caution continue to ripple through corporate results. The week ahead won’t quite match the mega-cap frenzy, but there’s still plenty to watch — especially in sectors like energy, pharma, and industrials. It may be a big week for Fed news, too, with the Fed making an announcement Wednesday — though no interest rate change is expected at this time. The week kicks off with a closely watched read on the U.S. service sector: the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for April is due Monday morning. This report tracks activity in industries like retail, health care, and hospitality — which together make up the bulk of the U.S. economy — and can offer key clues about broader momentum, or the lack of it. Earnings slow down from last week’s Big Tech bonanza, but Monday still brings key updates from across sectors. Palantir (PLTR+1.01%) reports after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS double last year’s result, amid continued interest in its AI-driven government and commercial contracts. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX+0.59%) is also due, with EPS forecast slightly down from last year’s. Ford (F-2.22%), expected to post flat earnings, faces scrutiny over its EV roadmap and how it’s handling margin pressure and tariff uncertainty. Tyson Foods (TSN+0.64%) and Clorox (CLX-0.03%) round out the day — both offering windows into consumer behavior as household staples and prices continue to fluctuate. Markets will digest the latest U.S. International Trade Balance report Tuesday morning, offering fresh insight into America’s trade deficit for March. The data comes as tariff rhetoric continues to grab headlines, making this a key release for economists and policy watchers alike. But the biggest event of the week is likely to be the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision. The FOMC meeting begins Tuesday and runs through Wednesday. After last week’s unexpectedly weak GDP print and increased signs of consumer hesitation, markets will be watching closely for any shift in tone. An announcement is expected Wednesday, the second day of the meeting. On the earnings front, Tuesday is a power-packed day across sectors. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.47%) also reports, and all eyes will be on its AI chip roadmap as the company looks to keep pace with Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%). Arista Networks (ANET+0.69%) will offer another read on AI infrastructure demand. Insurance and energy dominate elsewhere: Progressive (PGR+0.80%), Duke Energy (DUK-0.58%), Suncor (SU-1.90%), and Marathon Petroleum (MPC-1.53%) all report, giving investors fresh reads on consumer risk, oil supply dynamics, and refining margeins. Ferrari (RACE-1.06%) and Marriot (MAR-1.04%) round out the day with updates that touch on global demand, tariff impacts, and travel spending. Shopify (SHOP-4.98%) kicks off tech results in the morning, with expectations for steady e-commerce growth. In the afternoon, expect Fed news as the FOMC meeting concludes. While no rate change is expected, the policy statement and press conference could offer clues about future cuts or delays. Coinbase (COIN-3.06%) and Cheniere Energy (LNG-3.98%) headline the afternoon, offering insight into crypto trading volume and U.S. LNG exports, respectively. Anheuser-Busch (BUD+0.91%) will provide insights on global beer demand and pricing strategy, while ConocoPhillips (COP-3.65%) provides an update on oil and gas margins amid geopolitical upheavals. Disney (DIS-1.33%) also reports, with analysts looking to streaming profitability and theme park traffic. Uber (UBER+0.83%) is on deck too, aiming to show continued progress on profitability and margin gains. Applovin (APP-6.88%), DoorDash (DASH-0.70%), and Arm Holdings (ARM+1.07%) all report as well, giving another pulse check on digital advertising, food delivery, and semiconductor demand. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%) will provide updates on weight-loss drug momentum. Thursday brings a fresh wave of earnings from across the globe. Enbridge (ENB-0.27%), Canada’s pipeline giant, headlines the morning, with investors watching closely for updates on energy infrastructure demand and regulatory dynamics. Commerzbank’s release will provide a read on the European banking environment amid ongoing rate and currency volatility. On the economic calendar, markets will digest the latest initial jobless claims data, which could reinforce — or challenge — narratives around a softening labor market following the prior week’s weaker-than-expected GDP print. Again Friday, a range of global earnings reports will provide cross-sector, cross-border takeaways. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Mass protests erupt across China as Trump tariffs trigger economic crisis

China is experiencing severe civil unrest, with tens of thousands of workers protesting in industrial hubs like Shanghai and Inner Mongolia over unpaid wages and mass layoffs, driven by economic turmoil and U.S. tariffs. Trump's escalating tariffs have crippled China's export-dependent economy, causing factory closures, plummeting orders and financial distress for millions of workers, exacerbating existing crises like the property market collapse. The CCP is responding with heavy-handed suppression, deploying riot police and censoring dissent, but protests persist, reflecting growing desperation among workers. U.S. tariffs have accelerated the shift of production out of China to Taiwan, Vietnam and Mexico, further undermining confidence in Beijing's economic management. Beijing has signaled willingness to resume trade negotiations with the U.S. but demands the removal of all tariffs as a precondition.

Beijing has signaled willingness to resume trade negotiations with the U.S. but demands the removal of all tariffs as a precondition. China is facing its worst civil unrest in decades as waves of protests sweep industrial and manufacturing hubs, fueled by economic turmoil exacerbated by U.S. tariffs and a deepening property market collapse. Over the past two weeks, tens of thousands of workers have taken to the streets in cities from Shanghai to Inner Mongolia, demanding unpaid wages and protesting mass layoffs as export-dependent factories buckle under the weight of President Donald Trump's escalating trade war. The latest round of U.S. tariffs has dealt a devastating blow to China's already faltering economy. Export orders have plummeted to levels not seen since the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, forcing factory closures and leaving millions of workers unpaid. (Related: TRADE WAR FALLOUT: Chinese factories slow production as U.S. tariffs bite.) In Tongliao, desperate construction laborers climbed atop unfinished buildings, threatening to jump unless their months of unpaid wages were settled. Near Shanghai, thousands of employees from an LED manufacturing plant blocked highways, demanding back pay dating to January.

China is currently evaluating this matter."

"If the U.S. refuses to correct its erroneous unilateral tariff policies, it would only prove its complete lack of sincerity and further undermine mutual trust," the spokesperson said. "Saying one thing while doing another or even using talks as a cover for coercion and extortion â China will not accept this. China's position has been consistent and clear.

Title: Doctor Who ‘Lucky Day’ review: Pete, I owe you an apology
URL: https://slashdot.org/firehose.pl?op=view&amp;id=177288347
Time Published: 2025-05-03T19:12:16Z
Full Content:
Spoilers for “Lucky Day.” When the writers for this season of Doctor Who were announced, one name in the roster put me instantly on edge. Pete McTighe may have a distinguished filmography but, in this house, he’s known as the person who wrote “Kerblam.” That’s the Chibnall-era episode summed up as “Space Amazon is great and the people protesting poor working conditions and mass-layoffs are the real villains.” Imagine then, my delighted surprise when “Lucky Day” doesn’t just get its politics right, but it does so with molotov cocktails in hand. It’s 2007 and the Doctor and Belinda land in London as the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Day. The Doctor, Vindicator in hand, gets another set of coordinates before realizing a small boy, Conrad Clack, saw the TARDIS land. He hands Conrad a 50 pence piece and tells him it’s his “lucky day,” before the boy sprints back to his mother. But she’s not interested in his story about a magical blue box, striking the boy and saying she’s had enough of his lies. Conrad next encounters the TARDIS 17 years later when he spots it parked down a dark alley. There's a nearby door with a broken lock and he ventures inside to a closed down department store, where he’s stalked by an unseen monster. After a few seconds, the monster brushes past Conrad, leaving green slime on his neck — which is how it marks its prey. When the creature, the Shreek, emerges into the open ready to strike, it’s zapped away by the Doctor and Ruby. From the shadows, Conrad watches the Doctor hand Ruby a vial of antidote as she, too, was marked as prey. He stalks them back to the TARDIS and overhears their conversation — half an hour prior, she was hanging out with the Beatles, putting this just after “The Devil’s Chord.” He snaps a picture of Ruby and puts it online, asking the internet if anyone has seen this woman. He tracks down Ruby at some point after she stops traveling in the TARDIS, and invites her onto his podcast. Conrad tries to flirt with his guest, and a quick montage shows them date and start to get serious about each other. He even confesses he was present during that first encounter with the Shreek, and Ruby hands him a vial of antidote. She says the Shreek, which had tagged him with green slime, was preparing to return to this dimension to hunt him again. But UNIT — the Doctor’s military allies here on Earth — captured it (off-screen). The pair go to a countryside village where Conrad introduces her to his friends in a quiet pub. But, as night draws in, the lights begin to flicker, and the blink-and-you-miss-it blurs of scary monsters appear outside. One of Conrad’s friends, Sparky, goes missing, and Ruby calls UNIT who leap into action despite no signs of a Shreek incursion. Conrad confesses to Ruby he didn’t take the antidote, wanting to prove to her he was as brave as the Doctor to win her heart. When UNIT arrives, soldiers face off with a pair of Shreek monsters until they reveal they’re just Conrad’s stooges in rubber suits. Conrad isn’t an innocent caught up in a crisis he can’t comprehend, he’s a conspiracy theorist streamer claiming UNIT is a sham organization. He’s the type to engineer stunts and deceptively edit the resulting footage to smear his targets. I won’t name the real world figures Conrad is inspired by as we’d get angry emails from their lawyers, but I’m sure you can work out who they are. Conrad’s encounter with UNIT was livestreamed, and there’s another montage of people talking to their generic social media followers decrying the organization. He’s arrested, but quickly released, and given a welcome press tour by the British media, including a favorable BBC News report and a joke on the UK version of The Masked Singer. Conrad even gets consoled during an interview on The One Show — a prime time talk / magazine show — by its real presenter Alex Jones (not that one). UNIT’s overseers in the UK government and Geneva buckle to public pressure to put UNIT under close scrutiny. As its head, Kate Lethbridge-Stewart says, imagine the fate of the world if any dictator got their hands on UNIT’s arsenal of captured alien technology. Someone senior at UNIT demands the caged (and real) Shreek captured off-screen be removed from London and brought up to the helipad ready for transit. Meanwhile, Conrad has a man on the inside, who has been radicalized into believing his own employers are a sham, who helps him break into UNIT HQ. Kate refuses to lock the building down, insisting that it’s time the issue was solved once and for all. Conrad, with a stolen UNIT rifle in hand, tries to bait Kate into attacking her on camera with some vicious slander about her father, the legendary Brigadier. Kate is happy the Doctor isn’t here, since he won’t stop her from doing what the audience has been demanding she do for the last few minutes. She opens the cage holding the Shreek and lets it go for Conrad. Like all two-bit bullies, Conrad crumbles in the face of real danger and starts begging for mercy but Kate refuses. Sadly, Shirley hands Ruby a taser, which she uses to knock out the Shreek before it can bite Conrad’s head off. Now that his life has been saved, Conrad goes back to playing up for the livestream, boasting that UNIT’s “special effects” have gotten better. At which point the Shreek wakes up and bites his arm off. There’s a sharp cut, and next we see Conrad waking up in a prison cell with a contraption around his arm, presumably keeping it joined to his elbow. Suddenly, he hears the TARDIS noise and is brought aboard for the Doctor to tell him that he’s a bitter, sad person who will die in prison. But Conrad is unrepentant and says he “rejects” the Doctor’s “reality.” After he’s returned to the cell, he’s visited by Mrs. Flood, who confirms what he saw was real, and that she’s letting him free as it’s his “lucky day.” It does appear as if I owe Pete McTighe a fulsome apology and must assume he isn’t at fault for all of the reactionary politics of “Kerblam.” “Lucky Day” is both a worthy sequel to “73 Yards” and a sign that, if Doctor Who is just weeks from an enforced hiatus, then it’s going out swinging. It’s got a lot of targets, including the BBC’s habitual reputation-laundering of unsavory characters. The notion of who is in “the wrong” is made explicitly clear here, too, and Conrad occupies the same political (and narrative) circles as Roger ap Gwillam (Albion TV gets a reference). Like a lot of this year’s run, the episode feels like an overstuffed script which was then cut down to fit a specific runtime. But the structural work underpinning things feel more solid here, so while a lot of the connective tissue is absent, it’s not to the detriment of the story. Kate’s decision to unleash the Shreek may have been well-telegraphed but it’s better than the solution appearing out of nowhere because there’s five minutes left to run. There’s an element of the show playing to its strengths, and the genre savviness of its audience here as well. If you know the beats of a girl-meets-boy romance movie, then you’ll spot this is a cracked-ish mirror version of that. And we don’t need much evidence of Conrad’s villainy — calling the Doctor, UNIT and Kate a bunch of frauds to make money from his online audience — since we know they are our heroes. Plus, anyone who slanders Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, after all, deserves to get what’s coming to them. “Lucky Day” is smart about how it introduces us to Conrad, too, giving us obvious red flags from the get-go. Adult Conrad has no reservations about taking a picture of a stranger and sharing it online for the internet to identify on his behalf. There’s a hint of judgment in how he asks about her relationship to and with the Doctor, mirroring the way Alan Budd flirted with Belinda in “The Robot Revolution.” In fact, it’s an interesting counterpoint to that episode, since we get enough time with Conrad early on to learn to at least be wary of him, rather than it being a fairly unsupported third-act twist. If there’s one downside, it’s that the episode leans on the trope that survivors of abuse perpetuate that cycle of abuse. Conrad gets hit in the head by his mother and while it’s hard to assume a pattern of behavior from one scene, it didn’t seem like it was the first time. Much as we saw in “Lux,” there are limits to the storytelling possibilities inherent in a series about an immortal science clown traveling anywhere in time and space in a blue box. This episode is also focused on Ruby’s post-TARDIS life, which has left her in a vulnerable position. As she admits at the end of the episode, her time with the Doctor was spent in a constant state of panic and peril. She’s tired, she’s alone and the first man she tried to form a relationship with turned out to be using her. That’s bound to leave a scar, but the after effects of a trip in the TARDIS is rarely discussed in the context of the series itself. The majority of the classic series' companions lacked detailed interior lives, while modern day ones often move on to other “exciting” things rather than back to a normal life. It does appear as if the structure of the series isn’t just Russell T. Davies relying on a familiar rhythm but something more deliberate. “Lucky Day” is the fourth in a row that shares themes and elements with the same numbered episode in last year’s lineup. It’ll be interesting to see how much of next week’s “The Story and the Engine,” and the following week’s “The Interstellar Song Contest” shares with their counterparts from the first series. It’s plausible that the time fracture that was featured in “The Robot Revolution” has, somehow, knocked the series off its previously-planned course. That either within the show’s fiction or in its metafiction, we’re explicitly seeing parallel versions of those previous episodes. If you recall from that episode, too, the Doctor says he was told to meet Belinda by an unknown person. What if he was chasing down Conrad’s lead, and if so, would that be enough to create a paradox (even if the TARDIS can avoid such obstacles)? Then there’s the fact Conrad says he explicitly rejects the Doctor’s “reality,” which feels like a telling way of wording things. Especially as this season’s two-part finale is titled “Wish World” and “The Reality War,” although that title is hardly a massive clue. After all, last season’s finale was “Empire of Death,” as opposed to “The one in which it turns out Stuekh has been clinging to the TARDIS roof for God knows however long.” I’m not sure I want to read too much into Mrs. Flood releasing Conrad since that, like last week, could simply be a topper to the story. It may be that she’s simply letting him out to wreak more havoc and undermine UNIT and the Doctor’s goals rather than anything specific. Not to mention that if Mrs. Flood is a dimension-surfing entity hell-bent on destroying the Doctor, she’s hardly going to have much use for a schmucky YouTuber. This week, the BBC announced that “The Reality War” would not be getting its customary early in the day stream online. Instead, it’ll hit the iPlayer and Disney+ at the same time as the UK broadcast, and both episodes are being lined up for a small cinema release. That’s reserved for big event episodes, and it adds more weight to the rumor Gatwa has already left the show. Not to mention he’s starring in the play Born With Teeth from August 13 through November 11 — which would prevent him from shooting a season for 2026. Outside the mystery box elements of the show, this season feels as if it’s having a meta conversation with itself. “Lucky Day,” for instance, takes a similar premise as “Love and Monsters,” a Doctor-lite episode focusing on one of the so-called ordinary people who are peripherally involved in the Doctor’s adventures. Conrad is initially presented as one of the lost souls who are drawn to the Doctor — you could almost describe them as fans — but who don’t shine brightly enough to get the Time Lord’s special attention. Oh, and I can’t think of any reason beyond silly fan service that Conrad’s streaming outfit is called “Think Tank” beyond a deep cut nod to 1974’s “Robot.” After all, there’s almost nothing in common between the two entities and their goals are ostensibly in conflict.

Title: 5 Low-Volatility Dividend Stocks Yielding Up To 11.1%

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Businessmen Characters Investors Riding Roller Coaster on Red Chart, Fall on Uncertainty, Volatile ... More Up and Down Arrow Profit Graph, Trading Risk, Invest Economy Panic Cartoon People Vector Illustration Dividends over drama, please — like these five low-volatility dividend stocks that yield 7.2%, on average. Back in college they taught us that to increase returns, investors had to take on additional risk. This was a financial engineering class, by the way. The material arguably should have been presented differently, but it wasn't, because it was structured from a research perspective, not an investing one. It’s a common mistake in academia, and those who try to invest “buy the book.” The book says more beta means more returns. Well, this text can often be wrong. Big dividends and low volatility are a beautiful combination. Volatility can be measured in several ways. I find that “beta” is one of the best ones for regular investors because it’s easy to understand, and because it’s widely available from just about every market data provider. Beta measures an investment’s volatility against a benchmark. The benchmark (for instance, the S&P 500) will always have a beta of 1. So: Importantly, the reverse tends to be true—high-beta stocks generally fall more sharply than the market, while low-beta stocks often decline by less. So if we want some peace of mind, especially in a market like this, we want low-beta stocks. And if we really want to improve our chances of enjoying upside in downturns, we also want high yields. That’s in part because of the income return potential itself, but also because that income tends to attract more buyers during market scares. So let’s review several stocks that: Let’s start with B&G Foods (BGS, 11.1% yield), which we’ve discussed very recently, because it serves as a perfect warning about the dangers of relying on headline numbers alone. A stock can look like a perfect candidate in a screener, only to fall apart after just a little bit of scrutiny. B&G Foods is a consumer staples stock whose brands include pantry regulars like Crisco and Cream of Wheat. It has an 11% yield. Its 5-year beta is 0.8. Its 1-year beta is negative 0.6, which implies that when the market zigs, it zags—exactly what we want in a down market. And B&G is killing it in 2025. The market is off about 10% since its Feb. 19 high; BGS shares are up by more than 10%. What’s not to love? BGS Total Returns It’s arguable that the only reasons BGS has defied the market’s gravity lately are its yield and positioning in the staples sector. Past that, though, B&G earned less than it paid out in dividends last year, and it’s projected to do so this year and next. It’s also just a couple months removed from having to write down the worth of several of its best brands. Great headline metrics, but it’s downhill from there. Clearway Energy (CWEN/CWEN.A, 5.8% yield) is a different story. CWEN owns a portfolio of non-regulated clean energy generation assets representing 11.8 gigawatts of gross capacity—9 gigawatts from wind, solar, and battery energy storage systems, and 2.8 gigawatts of conventional dispatchable power capacity. So while it’s technically in the utility sector, its operations aren’t the same as our garden-variety power-or-gas “ute.” However, like utilities, Clearway is enjoying a surge in demand from data centers. It’s already developing traditional data center agreements, but it’s also beginning to scope “behind-the-meter” agreements, where data centers generate energy on-site using renewables rather than tapping into a traditional utility grid. CWEN has also been re-contracting its gas portfolio, which takes some important question marks off the board for the next few years. Clearway seems to have plenty of firepower to support its 5% to 8% annual dividend growth goal. That’s a fine level for a stock that’s already yielding nearly 6%, and better still, shareholders have been enjoying those raises on a quarterly basis for years. In addition to the dividend, shareholders have enjoyed relative stability of late—CWEN’s five-year beta of 0.9 is a hint less volatile than the market, but its shorter-term beta of around 0.4 reflects much smoother sailing over the past year. W.P. Carey (WPC, 5.8% yield) is another quarterly dividend raiser, but its smooth path has quite the hiccup in it. WPC Total Returns W.P. Carey is a massive, diversified net-lease real estate investment trust (REIT) that boasts more than 1,600 properties leased out to more than 360 tenants in 90 industries. More than a third of its portfolio is made up of industrial real estate, another quarter is warehouses, about 20% is retail, and the remainder is scattered across other property types including self-storage. What’s missing there is office properties, which W.P. Carey exited in September 2023 by spinning them off into Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP). Alongside that plan was a necessary “reset” of the dividend policy to account for the shift in assets. In other words, WPC’s dividend “cut” was merely a technicality—the dividend itself is quite healthy. That’s in part because virtually its entire portfolio (99.6%) includes rent escalators; high occupancy of 98%-plus helps, too. Five- and one-year betas of 0.8 and 0.3, respectively, reflect W.P. Carey’s status as a historically cool cucumber, too. Another REIT, LTC Properties (LTC, 6.4% yield), offers up the gold standard in dividend delivery: monthly payments. LTC, which stands for “long-term care,” boasts 190 properties in 25 states, with its investments split roughly 50/50 between assisted living properties and skilled nursing facilities. These were promising businesses until COVID-19 ruptured the space; operations are recovering, though. The stock actually managed to hit its pre-COVID high back in 2023, but that was short-lived. But its second attempt, which started six months ago, is looking better—and shares are stabilizing while the rest of the market falters. LTC not only boasts a five-year beta of 0.7 (good), but an extremely low one-year beta of just over 0.1 (great). That said, LTC is walking into a whirlwind of uncertainty—though possibly for the better. The company plans on pivoting to a RIDEA structure, which stands for the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act. Without getting too far into the weeds, this act lets REITs participate in net operating income, and it’s where LTC believes the majority of external growth opportunities in assisted living remain. Specifically, the company expects to convert $150 million to $200 million of gross investment assets to RIDEA-structured contracts by Q2 2025. It’s a potentially transformative structure, but also a complete unknown. One vital sign to look out for? A long, long-needed increase in its dividend, which has remained stagnant for nearly a decade. Sabra Health Care REIT (SBRA, 6.9% yield) is similar to LTC in that it’s a senior-focused healthcare play. Roughly half of Sabra’s portfolio is in skilled nursing and transitional care facilities, though it also has large allocations to managed senior housing (20%), behavioral health (14%) and leased senior housing (11%). A big signal of improvement in Sabra’s operational health came a little more than a year ago when it provided full-year guidance. Yes, that guidance missed estimates, but it actually released guidance—something it wasn’t able to do a year before that. That said, like LTC, while we’re seeing improvement in the underlying business, we need to see that improvement in our pockets, too. Still, SBRA ended up returning more than 30% in 2024, crushing the VNQ and its piddly 5% advance. Shares have cooled off in 2025 but are still up a few percentage points since the February 19 market peak. They also offer a high yield of nearly 7%, and extremely low volatility—a beta of 0.9 over the past five years isn’t much to look at, but it has registered a nearly unconscious beta of 0.2 over the past 52 weeks. And health care REITs could continue to be defensive if the economic environment continues to worsen. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

May 03, 2025 09:22 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, May 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

A major additional driver for the stock was the company’s foray into the data centre business, though the segment itself is yet to contribute significantly to overall revenues. After a relentless run, the stock is down over 50 per cent from its recent peak in January. While the correction in the broader markets triggered by FPI selling, corporate earnings weakness and US trade tariff challenges led to an up to 25 per cent correction in mid- and small-cap indices, some stocks in this space suffered a lot more. There was also excessive pessimism on the prospects of the nascent cloud/storage business of the company after the DeepSeek AI announcement led to fears that data centre capex the world over would face a reduction (this aspect will be discussed later). At ₹450, the stock trades at 25 times its per share earnings for FY26, making it a reasonable bet for investors with a two-three-year perspective, especially given the elevated valuations that most of the relatively-larger real estate companies trade at currently. The BSE Realty trades at a PE multiple of over 48 times. Robust traction in its residential construction business spanning luxury and affordable segments, visibility in its commercial division and healthy demand in its data centre offering, expected to start contributing to revenues significantly in the coming two-three years, are positive factors. The company also has a healthy balance sheet with very insignificant net debt levels. Over FY21-25, Anant Raj’s revenues grew at 69.4 per cent compounded annually to ₹2,060 crore, while net profits rose at 149.5 per cent to ₹426 crore in FY25. Revenue grew at 38.9 per cent and net profit expanded at 60.1 per cent year on year in FY25. The firm is largely a real estate player focused on the NCR region (mostly in Gurugram). Residential luxury projects, group housing, affordable housing (in Tirupati), plots and villas are areas that it specialises in. There are projects spanning 220 acres of integrated development in Gurugram. About 10.87 million sq ft of ongoing and planned projects are on the horizon, with a total expected revenue of ₹22,000 crore over the next several years. Since it operates in a high-end area of Gurugram, realisations on residential projects are high. In its group housing project, for example, the average selling price is ₹18,000 per sq ft. Anant Raj also has a commercial spaces segment spanning hotels, IT parks and office spaces. These businesses have steady rental income visibility for the foreseeable future. Anant Raj has been providing co-location services since 2019. In recent years, it has also started offering cloud services (infrastructure as a service) in association with Orange Business. It intends to get into AI-enabled solutions as well. By Q1FY26, the company expects as much as 28 MW of data centre capacity to be operational. Over the next five-odd years, it expects to have over 300 MW up and running. Revenues from the segment are insignificant currently. However, after the 28 MW capacity gets operationalised, the data centre segment may contribute significantly (more than 10 per cent) of the revenues by FY26. Over the next two-three years, as more capacity comes on stream, about 25-30 per cent of the company’s revenues may be generated from the segment. The key aspect to note here is that the data centre business generates an operating margin of 75 per cent or more. So, when more revenues flow in, company margins would expand. Anant Raj mostly had public sector companies as clients in its data centre business thus far, but increasingly even private firms are seeking its cloud services. Rising e-commerce usage, faster 5G rollout, cloud computing explosion and data protection law compliance are growth triggers for the company. AI and machine learning would be future drivers. Anant Raj has the added advantage of having its own real estate to house data centres by virtue of its large land bank. India’s data centre capacity crossed 1 GW in 2024, according to a recent report from JLL India, tripling from 2019-levels. Much of the capacity is absorbed. Another 795 MW is expected to be added over 2025-27. Average rents per kVA per month for a 5-20 MW capacity data centre are ₹7,000 in Mumbai. One MW is 1,000 kVA. According to another Anarock Capital report, the Indian data centre industry is worth $10 billion currently and generated an estimated $1.2 billion for operators in 2023-24. On DeepSeek’s entry reducing data centre requirements due to lower computational infrastructure requirements to train large language models, a recent report from Goldman Sachs provides clarity. It notes that questions remain on DeepSeek’s training, infrastructure and ability to scale. The report notes that AI-dedicated data centre is an emerging class of infrastructure and that very few exist currently. Global power demand from data centres will increase 50 per cent by 2027 and by as much as 165 per cent by the end of the decade (compared with 2023), as per Goldman Sachs Research estimates. Further, recently-reported March quarter results and CY26 outlook from US Big Tech companies — Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon also confirm this. Their CY26 mega capex plans related to AI data centre/cloud remains intact, as customer demand remains strong in this segment. Anant Raj has been reducing debt in its balance sheet steadily over the past few years. In FY25, its net debt is just ₹50 crore and the net debt-to-equity ratio is insignificant. The company enjoys a high EBITDA margin of 25 per cent and a net margin of over 20 per cent, which compares favourably among the best in the industry. Once the high-margin data centre business starts contributing significantly to the financials from FY26, margins would further head north.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 03 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 03 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software.

Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 03 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood.

Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

By adding BTC, Nvidia might tap into the digital finance trend. Crypto Twitter is abuzz with speculation that Nvidia may be considering a strategic allocation of Bitcoin [BTC] to its corporate treasury. According to AMBCrypto, this thesis isn’t far-fetched though. In fact, key macro and market dynamics suggested this could be a calculated move to diversify balance sheet exposure and hedge against fiat depreciation. If confirmed, such an allocation could act as a significant bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. In fact, it has the potential to attract more institutional investors into the market. The U.S. economy is only halfway through Trump’s re-election cycle and yet, top public company stocks have fallen by over 20% in Q1. Nvidia, ranked among the top three public companies with a market cap of $2.72 trillion, is no exception. At press time, its stock valuations were down 24.44% from its Q1 opening of $138. However, this could just be the beginning of a larger decline. Source: TradingView (NVDA) As a tech giant deeply invested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Nvidia is squarely positioned at the intersection of the U.S.-China trade war. This exposes the company to potential geopolitical risks that could further pressure its stock price. Moreover, with rising inflation eroding the purchasing power of the U.S Dollar, Nvidia could face higher operational costs, particularly for components and supply chain logistics. Given these macroeconomic pressures, it’s no surprise that more publicly traded companies are turning to Bitcoin to hedge against these risks. In fact, Metaplanet recently issued 3.6 billion JPY in 0% ordinary bonds to acquire additional Bitcoin. It is positioning itself as part of the growing trend of companies adding crypto assets to their corporate reserves. MicroStrategy’s [MSTR] stock has seen a staggering 3,000% return over the past five years, largely driven by its Bitcoin exposure. It has significantly outperformed most tech equities. This has translated to an annualized growth rate of 600%. In comparison, Nvidia’s stock posted returns of “just” 916%. Even though it trails MicroStrategy by a significant margin. Source: X This stark divergence highlights the outsized impact of Bitcoin on MicroStrategy’s performance. Bitcoin’s surge from $10,000 in 2020 to $96,172 at press time, reflecting a year-to-date price gain of 715%, further substantiates its role as a critical driver of portfolio returns for firms like MicroStrategy. With results like these, it’s no wonder that other big players might soon jump on the bandwagon. And guess what? Nvidia looks like it’s next in line to make that bold move!
