Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Experiences Sixth Day of Outflows Amid US Elections

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has now seen six days of net outflows since its launch in January. This means more money has been withdrawn than those added on those days. On November 5, US election day, institutional investors seemed to play it safe, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recording $44.2 million in net outflows, according to CoinGlass data. This outflow marked IBIT’s sixth negative flow since its launch in January. The last outflow was on October 10, when $10.8 million exited the fund. Altogether, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw 116.8 million in net outflows. The largest outflow was from the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, which saw $68.2 million taken out. The only fund with new inflow for the day was the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, which had $19.3 million added to it. This marked the third consecutive day of net outflows for the US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The previous day, November 4, the 11 Bitcoin funds had their second-biggest outflow ever, with over $541.1 million withdrawn. After the US trading day ended, the spot crypto markets saw a big surge. This happened as election results started coming in, with Bitcoin price reaching a new all-time high of $75,000. Henrik Anderson, the chief investment officer at Apollo Crypto, explained that Bitcoin has become a key focus for traders worldwide. He called it the “election trade,” meaning that many investors are now looking to Bitcoin during the election period, hoping for gains. He looked at betting markets and traditional sources to estimate the chances of Donald Trump winning. Based on this information, Henrik figured there was an 80% to 90% chance that Trump would win. Henrik also said that Bitcoin seems to be following this trend. Bitcoin is already above $74,000, and he believes it may have already made most of its price move for now. If Trump wins, he predicts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of the year. This is based on the idea that Trump’s victory would continue to boost Bitcoin’s price. In a blog post, Nate Geraci, the president of ETF Store, shared his thoughts on how elections affect investments. He said that people often exaggerate how much elections impact the market. He pointed out that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) leadership plays a much more significant role. The SEC is responsible for making investment rules and regulations, which often impact market sentiment. Geraci believes that the regulatory environment, especially those who lead the SEC, can significantly affect ETFs’ development and innovation. The SEC’s decision can either help or slow down new ideas in the ETF market. He also mentioned that no one knows what will happen with the situation. There are many unknowns, and it’s hard to predict the exact outcome. However, Geraci believes the best long-term solution would be to create a clear and balanced set of rules for crypto. This would require cooperation between the two major political parties to develop a framework that works for everyone. Still, he thinks it’s very likely that the results of this election will impact how quickly new crypto ETFs are developed.

Title: After Trump Win, Bernie Sanders Blames Democrats for Abandoning Working People
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/bernie-sanders-shawn-fain-democrats-trump
Time Published: 2024-11-07T03:55:00Z
Full Content:
Shortly before Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her concession speech on Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders forcefully called out Democratic Party leadership for losing The White House and at least one chamber of Congress to Republicans. “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a statement. ​“First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well.” “While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,” said the senator, who decisively won reelection on Tuesday as Republicans reclaimed the upper chamber. ​“And they’re right.” After seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, Sanders spent this cycle campaigning for Harris, warning of Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s return, blasting billionaire involvement in U.S. politics, and urging Democrats to better serve working people. In Sanders’ new statement, he highlighted U.S. income and wealth inequality, worker concerns about artificial intelligence, and the federal government’s failure to provide paid leave and universal healthcare while pouring billions of dollars into Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip. “Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign? Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful oligarchy which has so much economic and political power?” he asked. ​“Probably not.”​“In the coming weeks and months those of us concerned about grassroots democracy and economic justice need to have some very serious political discussions,” Sanders concluded. ​“Stay tuned.” Progressives — who have responded to Trump’s Electoral College and popular vote win by criticizing billionaires who backed him and promising ​“unprecedented resistance” during his second term — echoed Sanders’ remarks. Sharing Sanders’ statement on X — the social media platform owned by billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk — United Auto Workers (UAW) communications director Jonah Furman said: ​“The task has been clear for a decade. The question is only whether and when we will rise to the task.” Separately, the union’s president, Shawn Fain, said in a Wednesday statement that ​“UAW members around the country clocked in today under the same threat they faced yesterday: unchecked corporate greed destroying our lives, our families, and our communities.” “We’ve said all along that no matter who is in the White House, our fight remains the same,” Fain continued, pointing to the battle against ​“broken trade laws” like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and fights for good union jobs, a secure retirement for everyone, a living wage, affordable healthcare, and time for families. “It’s time for Washington, D.C. to put up or shut up, no matter the party, no matter the candidate,” added Fain, whose union endorsed Harris. ​“Will our government stand with the working class, or keep doing the bidding of the billionaires? That’s the question we face today. And that’s the question we’ll face tomorrow. The answer lies with us. No matter who’s in office.” In a post-election column, Chuck Idelson, former communications senior strategist for National Nurses United, made the case that ​“amid the postmortems and reckoning that will now follow the wreckage of Donald Trump’s return to ​‘absolute’ power, as authorized by the Supreme Court, there are … two notes in particular that deserve a deeper dive.” “In Missouri, a state Trump won by 58%, voters also acted to increase the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour and to require employers to provide paid sick leave to workers,” he pointed out. ​“In Nebraska, another red state won by Trump, voters also passed a paid sick leave measure, Initiative 436, by 75%.” In addition to the ballot measures, Idelson highlighted that ​“in the multitude of exit poll results, one particularly stands out — 94% of registered Republicans voted for Trump, the exact same percentage he received in 2020. The heavy campaign focus on pulling away Republican voters from Trump turned out to be a pipe dream. The old cliché ​‘it’s the economy stupid,’ triumphed again.” Harris’ campaign, he argued, ​“reflected the direction the Democratic Party establishment has taken, away from working-class issues since the advent of neoliberal policies in the 1970s and carried out by most Democratic Party presidents since.” Historian Harvey J. Kaye, professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, took aim at the Democratic Party on social media Wednesday, noting failures to stand up to billionaires, raise the minimum wage, and pass the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. Morris Pearl, chair of the Patriotic Millionaires and a former managing director at BlackRock, said in a Wednesday statement that ​“a self-avowed authoritarian successfully wielded the economic frustrations of millions to win the most consequential election of our nation’s history. The Democratic establishment has only itself to blame.” “Voters demanded a fundamental overhaul of a rigged economic system. When neoliberal Democrats dithered, Donald Trump offered to clear the board, and voters chose the dark unknown rather than the status quo,” Pearl added. ​“The only question remaining is, why are Democrats surprised? This is the entirely predictable result of a multi-decade strategy to appease the rich that met no serious resistance.” The Sunrise Movement — a youth-led climate group that worked to reach millions of young voters in swing states to defeat Trump — similarly stressed on social media Wednesday that ​“last night’s results were a call for change. Millions of people are fed up after living through decades of a rigged economy and corrupt political system. They are looking for someone to blame. It’s critical the Dem Party takes that seriously.” “For decades, Democrats have prioritized corporations over people. This is the result. Every working American feels the crisis. We can’t pay rent. Our government can’t pass basic legislation. The WEATHER has turned against us. And Dems look us in the eye and say it’s fine,” the group continued. ​“Trump loves corporations even more than Democrats do, but he ran an anti-establishment campaign that gave an answer to people’s desire for change.” “We can stop him, and we must,” Sunrise said of Trump. ​“But it’s going to take many thousands of people taking to the streets and preparing to strike. And it’s going to take mass movements putting out a better vision for our country than Trumpism and proving that we can make it happen.” This article was originally published by Common Dreams.

Title: Bitcoin surges as backers bet Donald Trump’s election will bring crypto into the mainstream

In Ohio, Republican car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno (pictured, right, alongside vice-presidential nominee JD Vance) beat Democratic incumbent and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown for a senate seat. Photo: Getty Bitcoin jumped to a record high, part of a wave of trades across global markets in response to Donald Trump emerging victorious over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. The largest digital asset rose as much as 9pc to $75,372 (€70,391) as early results showed Mr Trump barrelling towards a win. It traded at just below $74,000 as of 10:40am yesterday morning as networks declared Mr Trump had won the race, setting him up for a second term in the White House. The last peak was in March, when investors were cheered by inflows into US bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin is viewed by many as a so-called Trump trade because the former president embraced digital assets during his campaign after a major push by the industry. Crypto muscled onto the high table of politics by deploying a giant campaign-finance war chest to further its agenda. Mr Trump vowed to make the US the crypto capital of the planet, create a strategic bitcoin stockpile and appoint regulators who love digital assets. Ms Harris adopted a more measured approach, pledging to support a regulatory framework for the industry. In contrast, the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Biden administration pursued a crackdown via a flurry of enforcement actions. Donald Trump holds hands with former first lady Melania Trump after speaking to supporters in West Palm Beach (Lynne Sladky/AP) "The crypto industry feels like it's been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years, and it senses that might be coming to an end," said Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management. "People are starting to position for the next few years in crypto." In Ohio, Republican car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno beat Democratic incumbent and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown for a senate seat. Crypto titans spent some $40m to defeat Mr Brown – a long-time sceptic of the industry – underlining the influence of their political outlays. The crypto industry feels like it's been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years The prospect of friendlier US crypto rules led to gains across the digital-asset market. Second-ranked token Ether added about 8pc. Dogecoin, a meme-crowd favourite promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk, rallied 31pc at one point. Digital-asset companies often complained that officials under President Joe Biden failed to create a clear new legal framework for the nascent market. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said existing rules apply and repeatedly labelled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency cracked down on crypto following a 2022 market rout that triggered a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried's fraudulent FTX exchange. "The first test of [Trump’s] credibility to watch out for is whether he will deliver on his promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office," said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market making firm Auros. Bitcoin has now advanced 75pc in 2024, topping assets such as stocks and gold. US spot-bitcoin ETFs, from issuers such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, have attracted $23.5bn of net inflows following their launch at the start of the year – among the most successful new ETFs in history.

Title: Recent tech layoffs reflect not just economic realities but cultural truths
URL: https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-827896
Time Published: 2024-11-07T01:24:52Z
Full Content:
The year 2024 has been brutal for tech workers. What started as a trickle of downsizing in 2022 has now turned into a full-blown wave of layoffs that shows no signs of stopping. From Silicon Valley to Tel Aviv and across Europe’s biggest tech hubs, tens of thousands of workers are being let go as companies scramble to stay profitable in the face of economic uncertainty, rising costs, and a rapid shift toward automation.Major players such as Google, Intel, Tesla, and Amazon have been drastically downsizing their workforce, impacting roles across various departments from engineering to customer service and even key areas such as AI. Intel, facing intense competition and delays in product development, has slashed 15,000 jobs and recently announced an additional 2,200 cuts in the United States, with more layoffs expected in Israel. Similarly, Tesla, grappling with surging material costs, cut 14,000 employees as part of its operational tightening.

Major players such as Google, Intel, Tesla, and Amazon have been drastically downsizing their workforce, impacting roles across various departments from engineering to customer service and even key areas such as AI. Intel, facing intense competition and delays in product development, has slashed 15,000 jobs and recently announced an additional 2,200 cuts in the United States, with more layoffs expected in Israel. Similarly, Tesla, grappling with surging material costs, cut 14,000 employees as part of its operational tightening.

In America, layoffs are seen as a necessary evil to maintain business health, even if it means throwing workers into uncertainty with little notice. In Israel, the process is more personal but equally painful, tearing apart tight-knit communities that view their workplace as an extension of family. Conversely, Europe takes a combative stance, with workers protected by legal frameworks and unions, leading to public backlash and prolonged negotiations.The tech layoffs of 2024 reflect not just economic realities but cultural truths. As companies worldwide pivot towards AI, automation, and cost-cutting strategies, how they handle the human cost of these decisions reveals as much about their values as their balance sheets. Ultimately, these layoffs expose the intersection of technology, humanity, and culture in a way that no algorithm can fully calculate.

Title: Nvidia Stock Prices to Watch as AI Darling Becomes World's Most Valuable Company

Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) this week surged into the top position among the world's most valuable companies by market capitalization, surpassing iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). The AI chipmaker’s shares gained about 4% on Wednesday, hitting a record high of $146.49, as U.S. equities soared following the election of Donald Trump as president. Nvidia shares have risen nearly three-fold since the start of the year amid insatiable demand for the company’s family of AI chips, including its next generation Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs). Below, we analyze the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels that investors may be watching. Since breaking out from a symmetrical triangle last month, Nvidia shares have traded mostly sideways to higher as investors look for future catalysts that may drive the AI favorite’s next move. It’s worth pointing out that in recent months, the stock’s volume has tracked steadily lower, potentially indicating that larger market participants remained on the sidelines ahead of the US election and amid uncertainty over chip export curbs. Looking ahead, investors should monitor for increasing share turnover while eyeing these important price levels on Nvidia’s chart. The first lower level to watch sits at $144, an area on the chart just below Wednesday's closing price where the shares may encounter support near a period of consolidation positioned around the prior all-time high (ATH). Further selling could see Nvidia shares fall to around $125, an area on the chart where they currently find support near the closely watched 50-day moving average and symmetrical triangle’s upper trendline. A breakdown below this level could see the stock fall to the $97 region. Investors may seek entry points at this location near a trendline joining two March peaks with a series of prices positioned around the early-August low. To forecast a higher level using technical analysis, we can apply the measuring principle, often referred to as a measured move. This technique works by calculating the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near their widest point and adding that amount to the initial breakout area. In other words, we add $55 to $125, which projects an upside target of $180. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

The rupee declined 6 paise to close at a fresh lifetime low of 84.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday, as weak domestic equities and sustained foreign fund outflows dented market sentiment. Forex traders said investors were also cautious ahead of the US Fed meeting outcome. Moreover, overnight gains in crude oil prices also weighed on the local unit. However, a correction in the dollar index against major currencies helped the rupee and restrained the slide, they added. Aurionpro Solutions, a leading technology provider, has secured a significant contract from Chennai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (CMRL) to deliver automated fare collection (AFC) systems for Phase II of the Chennai Metro. The shares of Aurionpro Solutions Limited were trading at ₹1,665 down by ₹30 or 1.77 per cent during the closing bell. Swiggy IPO has been subscribed 0.34 times as of 3.36 pm on November 7, 2024. QIB portion has been subscribed 0.28 times, NII 0.12 times, retail 0.81 times, and those reserved for employees 1.11 times. The issue closes on November 8, 2024. G R Infraprojects has emerged as L-1 bidder for establishing “Transmission Scheme for integration of Bijapur REZ” in the State of Karnataka, through tariff based competitive bidding (TBCB) process on Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis Shares trade flat on the BSE at ₹1,630.90. Suraj Ltd has implemented the 1st phase of Flanges product plant. Company is in implementing phase of carbon steel plant and it will be completed by April 2025. Stock trades flat on the NSE at ₹440.90 Swiggy IPO subscribed 0.31 times. Track live updates. Top gainers: Apollo Hospitals (6.67%), SBI (0.50%), HDFC Life (0.37%), TCS (0.19%), L&T (0.19%) Top losers: Hindalco (-8.42%), Trent (-6.91%), Grasim (-3.34%), Shriram Finance (-3.03%), Tech Mahindra (-2.67%) Stocks advanced on BSE at 3 pm on November 7, 2024, were 1,834 against 2,079 stocks that declined, and 121 remained unchanged. Total stocks traded were 4,034. The number of stocks that recorded a 52-week high was 240, and those that hit a 52-week low was 13. A total of 350 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 198 in the lower circuit. The Nifty opened within the range of the previous day, and has slid since after an attempt to build on yesterday’s advance. For the day, support near 24,400 will be key. This is because any close under this level will create a “bearish dark cloud cover”. If the decline worsens, then participants will be watching yesterday’s open 24,309 closely - if the market ends below this marker it will create the more powerful “bearish engulfing”. For the last few days, 24,500 has served as resistance and will continue to be the critical upside hurdle going forward. On the downside, 24,309 and 24,204 will be key levels to watch. Niva Bupa Health Insurance Company IPO has been subscribed 0.54 times as of 2.27 pm on November 7, 2024. QIB portion has been subscribed 0.78 times, NII 0.03 times, and retail 0.56 times. The issue closes on November 11, 2024. Almost 50% valuation compared to Zomato gives some comfort although it should not be considered as an arbitrage in valuation. If Swiggy’s EBITDA catches up to 3-4% in the food delivery business, which is currently at 1% and Average Order Value (AOV) improves to Rs. 550-600 levels in quick commerce with higher non-grocery share, we can see bridging in the valuation gap. Although, this should not be expected in near term. ​Sagility India IPO​ has been subscribed 2.32 times as of 2.18 pm on November 7, 2024. QIB portion has been subscribed 2.65 times, NII 0.93 times, retail 3.42 times, and those reserved for employees 3.26 times. The issue closes today. Brokerage Motilal Oswal recognised that Swiggy pioneered the hyperlocal commerce industry in India, launching food delivery in 2014 and quick commerce in 2020, and is well-recognised as a leader in innovation. Swiggy operates in an oligopoly market which is at a nascent stage, thus providing enough opportunities for players to create their niche. Motilal analysts remarked that the food delivery platform’s innovation DNA is key to success and it could again be at the forefront through its new 10-minute food delivery offering. Indian equity benchmarks extended their losses in afternoon trading on Thursday, with the BSE Sensex plunging 782.84 points to 79,595.29 and the NSE Nifty dropping 262.10 points to 24,221.95, marking a decline of 0.97 per cent and 1.07 per cent respectively. 1.

The decisive win by Trump of the US mandate, stronger than expected, the probability of easing of tensions in the middle east is now a high possibility. At the same time, his statements over the next few weeks could put some cats amongst the pigeons as he makes noises on China, Russia, Oil and of course, renewables. With the USD gaining strength, Gold – being inversely related, is bound to fall and therefore the Fed meeting today holds great importance as to the future direction of bonds and the dollar. On the one hand the pre election rhetoric points to yields hardening in the US, growth and incremental data is unlikely to change the trajectory that the central banks wish to take and will act as a counter. Hence a bit of bumpiness is expected in the next 2-3 weeks and maybe right upto the President elect assuming office in January. Gold as of now remains on an uptrend but like we have been saying, tight stops are necessary especially if the pivots around USD 2600 are challenged as that would mark a significant break. Till then, its anticipated that the initial kneejerk reaction on the USD may reverse esp if President Trump talks around higher deficits that could put pressure on the USD. “ Driven by tractor and automobile sales, Mahindra & Mahindra is expected to report strong revenue growth in Q2.

The six-member monetary policy committee (MPC), which met from October 7-9, had decided unanimously to change the stance to ‘neutral’ from ‘withdrawal of accommodation’. However, it kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent by a majority of 5 out of 6 members.

Full Content:
Nvidia, a leading American software company, reclaims the title of the world’s most valuable company by market capitalization, topping tech giant Apple. The company’s shares jumped by 2.5% during Tuesday’s trading hours, pushing its market valuation to roughly $3.44 trillion, topping Apple’s $3.37 trillion. The world’s most valuable companies, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, have been contesting the “world’s most valuable company” tag for most of the year. However, Nvidia was the year’s surprise story thanks to its investment in chips that power the Artificial Intelligence technology. Nvidia has been bolstered by the 850% growth in the AI and machine learning space and the growth of AI-based coins. As the company enjoys an increased demand for its chips, other AI coins like the Internet Computer, the NEAR protocol, Bittensor, Injective, and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance have enjoyed their respective surges too. Nvidia overtakes Apple as world’s most valuable company https://t.co/chWMKMofPL pic.twitter.com/Zfqa4PBYcu — CNA (@ChannelNewsAsia) October 25, 2024 Last September 6th, Nvidia’s price was just $102.83 but soon started to climb thanks to increasing demand for its chips. At the heart of its operations are the AI chips that power many large language models today. According to Fall Ainina of James Investment Research, Nvidia’s current position is linked to machine learning and generative AI industry growth. Thanks to its role in advancing AI technology, the company’s stock has increased by over 850% since 2022. The company supplies chips to top tech companies such as Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and even Microsoft. Analysts expect the company’s revenues to beat the company’s estimates, with an additional 44% growth next year. Nvidia’s impressive performance this year can be attributed to the demand for its chips and the growth in AI coins. For example, there’s NEAR protocol, which jumped by 5.40%. It’s currently priced at $3.81, with over $222 million in 24-hour trading volume. Internet Computer is another AI coin that’s surging, adding 5% to its market value, with a market volume of $57 million. Plenty of AI coins are joining the tech firm’s market rally. Bittensor is now trading at $482, and Artificial Superintelligence is rising to $1.25, reflecting an increase of 10.96%. Nvidia’s growing market cap and the continuing popularity of AI coins highlight AI’s increasing influence. Some of the top Wall Street companies, such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet, are now working with the company to expand their AI capabilities. Market analysts expect the company and AI coins to sustain their rally in the short term. As of this writing, Nvidia accounts for 7% of the US S&P 500 Index weight. It’s also crucial to note that AI stocks like Nvidia are some of the performing stocks for the year.

The net worths of many of the world’s wealthiest people skyrocketed Thursday, particularly those with strong ties to cryptocurrency, with stocks soaring following Donald Trump’s election win as the president-elect is expected to embrace cryptocurrency and corporate tax cuts during his upcoming term. Musk is one of Trump's most wealthy backers. (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) Elon Musk: The Tesla chief, who was one of Trump’s biggest financial backers in the lead-up to the election, experienced a nearly $21 billion jolt to his net worth Wednesday, bringing it to $285.6 billion as Tesla’s stock closed up nearly 15% on Wednesday at $288.53—its highest share price recorded this year. Jeff Bezos: Bezos’ net worth is up $7 billion to $223.5 billion after a strong day of trading for Amazon shares (up 3.8%), maintaining his position as the world’s second-wealthiest person behind Musk. Larry Ellison: The Oracle co-founder is nearly $12 billion richer, as his net worth jumped to $220.8 billion and lessened the gap between him and Bezos for No. 2 on Forbes’ billionaire list. Warren Buffett: The world-renowned investor’s net worth spiked $7.6 billion Wednesday, bringing it to $147.4 billion, with Berkshire Hathaway rising more than 5%. Brian Armstrong: Armstrong, the CEO of crypto platform Coinbase, has an estimated $11 billion net worth after a $2.6 billion increase Wednesday, the result of a whopping 31% surge for Coinbase as it closed at $254.31 (the platform’s co-founder, Fred Ehrsam, became $600 million richer as markets closed). Vlad Tenev & Baiju Bhatt: The Robinhood co-founders’ net worths climbed together, with Bhatt’s up $307 million to $1.9 billion and Tenev’s up nearly $300 million to $1.9 billion, as well (Robinhood shares surged almost 20% Wednesday). Michael Saylor: Saylor, the founder of bitcoin strategy firm MicroStrategy, became nearly $600 million richer as his estimated net worth climbed to $6.6 billion while the company’s stock swelled 13% to $257.81—one of its highest points of the year.

Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg did not join in on the rush, as he experienced a small drop in net worth to $197.9 billion and kept his place as the fourth-wealthiest person in the world behind Ellison. Meta shares ended the trading day at $572.05—down $0.38. Bitcoin reached an all-time high Wednesday, skyrocketing past the $76,000 mark in reaction to Trump’s electoral victory. Businesses and crypto-related stocks are likely reacting positively to the election results because Trump has positioned himself as a “crypto president” and promised tax cuts to prominent CEOs including Apple’s Tim Cook and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon. Cryptocurrency investors also believe his presidency will be favorable for crypto regulations, as Trump said this year he aims to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet”—a full reversal from the doubts and criticisms he levied at cryptocurrency years ago.

Since President-elect Donald Trump’s first term in office, the U.S. has wielded its trade restriction and sanctioning powers in an effort to curb China’s technological advances. Now that he’s headed back to the White House, the semiconductor war between the U.S. and China could escalate. “If Trump ascends to the office, he’s already said in his campaign rhetoric that he’s going to double down and even make tariffs as well as export controls more severe,” Arthur Dong, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told Quartz in a pre-election interview. Efforts to slow China’s advanced chipmaking abilities under Trump’s first presidential term were continued by the Biden administration. Earlier this year, the Biden administration was reportedly debating using an export control called the foreign direct product rule, which would impact companies in U.S. allies including Japan’s Tokyo Electron (TOELY-0.70%) and Dutch chip machine-maker ASML (ASML+2.40%). The rule does not allow the export of any good to any country if it is manufactured with a certain percentage of U.S. intellectual property components. It was later reported that some allies would be exempt if the rule is expanded. “He’s [Trump] likely to go further than the Biden administration has gone with regard to the imposition of blanket tariffs across a much wider variety of goods,” Dong said. Under Trump’s first administration, Chinese tech giant Huawei was placed on the U.S. Entity List in 2019 after the government determined it had “been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Other Chinese semiconductor firms have been added to the list to restrict U.S. companies from sending equipment for advanced chip manufacturing. Trump extended the ban on Huawei’s products through 2021, and trade restrictions on it and other Chinese tech firms have only tightened under the Biden administration. Before the election, U.S.-based chip equipment makers were reportedly bracing for more export controls under the Biden administration, telling suppliers they worried about risking their vendor status for using certain components supplied by China. The companies also reportedly told suppliers not to have Chinese investors or shareholders. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” ASML chief executive Christophe Fouquet said in October. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” During his most recent campaign for the presidency, Trump said he would impose tariffs on chips from Taiwan, which could have a heavy impact on global chipmaking, as a majority of the world’s most advanced chips are fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+4.15%). The Taiwanese-chipmaker counts Nvidia (NVDA+2.24%) and Apple (AAPL+2.21%) as major customers. In October, Trump accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry during an appearance on the The Joe Rogan Experience podcast — a point he also made in July during an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. In response to a question about supporting Taiwan against Chinese aggression, Trump said the island “took our chip business from us.” “I mean, how stupid are we,” Trump said. “They took all of our chip business. They’re immensely wealthy.” Instead, Trump said, Taiwan should be paying the U.S. to protect it. “I don’t think we’re any different from an insurance policy,” Trump told Bloomberg. “Why? Why are we doing this?” During his interview with Rogan, Trump also criticized the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed by the Biden administration in 2022 — partly to spur domestic advanced chip manufacturing. “That chip deal is so bad, we put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come and borrow the money and build chip companies here, and they’re not going to give us the good companies anyway,” Trump said on the podcast, adding that the U.S. should instead put tariffs on chips coming into the U.S. Over a dozen chipmakers, including U.S.-based Intel (INTC+4.79%), Taiwan-based TSMC, and South Korea-based SK Hynix, are still awaiting billions of dollars in funding and loans from the U.S. CHIPS Act to build semiconductor hubs throughout the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Will New Trump Administration Set Off Merger Fever In Hollywood?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2024/11/06/will-new-trump-administration-set-off-merger-fever-in-hollywood/
Time Published: 2024-11-06T22:21:15Z

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Among the outgrowths of Donald Trump’s presidential victory is an expected shift in antitrust and other regulatory interventions, well timed for battered Hollywood studios hoping to restructure for a post-Streaming Wars era. In case you missed it, Netflix won those Streaming Wars, perhaps more emphatically than anything in the political sphere this year. Financially strained studios have cut thousands of jobs, killed off projects, reduced new program orders, sold off pieces to private equity, and otherwise pondered what next if they’re to survive and thrive. As MoffettNathanson senior analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note: “The battle caused a lot of damage to traditional media and Netflix has emerged as the clear victor.” Studio chiefs have mused in various public settings about joint ventures, partnerships, and outright mergers and acquisitions as a way to better compete against Netflix and the video operations of tech titans Apple, Alphabet and Amazon. Now, with changes afoot at what has been a reflexively anti-merger Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice, media moguls may again get to mogul-ing, instead of bemoaning their fates while leaving many others unemployed. The latest trial balloon came during last week’s Comcast earnings call, when President Robert Cavanagh surprised listeners, saying the company is considering spinning off or otherwise removing its cable operations from Comcast’s complicated corporate structure, while holding on to both the NBC broadcast network and loss-making, under-sized streaming service Peacock. “We are now exploring,” Cavanagh said, “whether creating a new well-capitalized company, owned by our shareholders and composed of our strong portfolio of cable networks, would position them to take advantage of opportunities in the changing media landscape and create value for our shareholders.” Macquarie senior media-tech analyst Tim Nollen wrote that a cable spinoff likely would help Comcast’s shares and core media assets, but questioned who would invest in a troubled, declining sector, especially if the assets are stripped of the cross-platform synergies possible now. For instance, the all-news MSNBC and all-business-news CNBC share many assets with NBC News. How would they disentangle, and what would be left of value? “(Comcast’s) NBCU(niversal) has been deemphasizing cable nets for some time, exiting regional sports and putting content on Peacock; new NBA rights were won thanks to broadcast and Peacock - not cable, as Warner Bros Discovery found out,” Nollen wrote. “We question how valuable cable networks would be stand-alone, without ties to NBCU's studio and streaming capability, and lacking advertising tie-ins; industry M&A/JVs appear possible.” The cable spinoff is just one possible deal that likely will be more feasible under a Trump regime with a more wave-it-through approach. But it won’t be the only one. For instance, private equity giant TPG is trying to do two deals in one: take over AT&T’s minority share of DirecTV and merge it with competitor DISH Networks. Given the struggles vexing both satellite TV providers, and DISH’s particularly perilous finances, even Biden/Harris regulators were expected to probably approve the merger, much as happened in 2008 with the Sirius and XM satellite radio services. The biggest challenge there might be DISH bondholders who don’t want to take a haircut on their notes. Shari Redstone has agreed to sell her stake in Paramount Global to a consortium led by Skydance founder David Ellison and his father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. That deal likely also would have been approved regardless, but the elder Ellison’s close relationship with Trump may speed things along. And given the uncertainties around Paramount’s clutch of cable networks, it may simplify some of the restructuring both Paramount’s current management and Ellison may have in mind. But lots of clues suggest far more dealmaking across the industry is in the offing. What might that look like? To begin with, MoffettNathanson’s Fishman attempted to quantify what a major modern media company (to paraphrase Gilbert & Sullivan) might look like. “Companies for whom video is a core part of the business trade at significant discounts, with Netflix’s enterprise value now greater than Disney, WBD, Fox, and Paramount combined!” wrote Fishman in a research note released last week. “Where does that leave the rest of the field? What does each player bring to the table, and how might a bit of strategic M&A augment their position?” It’s increasingly clear what assets those reshaped media companies would need to compete as the industry enters the second half of the 2020s, Fishman wrote. “We see these assets as: a scaled streaming service (both in the U.S. and globally), a free AVOD platform, top-tier sports rights, a U.S. broadcast network, and film and television studios,” Fishman wrote. Broadcast has the broadest reach, and as cable viewership fades, “Having a broadcast network, therefore, has increasingly become a must in the eyes of top sports leagues when evaluating distribution partners...Sports drive viewership, subscriptions and advertising dollars,” Fishman wrote. Disney remains the combined leader in overall viewership most months across all platforms, though YouTube with its vast supply of user-generated content sometimes grabs the mantle, according to Nielsen statistics released at the recent Advertising Research Foundation’s OTT conference. That cross-platform approach suggests there’s still power even in older distribution platforms when it’s intelligently harnessed and cross-promoted. “As for non-sports viewing, free AVOD / FAST channel platforms bring reach and inventory that can supplement ad sales across a portfolio,” Fishman wrote. “AVOD is the basic cable networks of the streaming age. These platforms now provide an avenue for monetizing older content for companies with large catalogues.” There are some combinations of existing media companies that might fill respective holes on each side, and would make sense as the companies try to scale up against Netflix and the Titans. Fox, for instance, has hugely popular AVOD platform Tubi and a broadcast network with strong sports rights in the NFL and other major sports, even after it sold off most film and TV studio assets to Disney in 2019. Warner Bros. Discovery, by contrast, has highly regarded film and TV production studios, the increasingly global Max streaming service with more than 100 million subscribers, and its own batch of sports rights (though it loses the NBA after this season). That’s why, Fishman wrote, “When thinking about the next potential media deal, we continue to see a marriage of Fox and WBD’s assets as the most natural fit, especially when considering how it would fill WBD’s current need for top-tier sports rights and grant it ownership of a big four U.S. broadcast network.” Less likely, perhaps, is any imminent deal affecting Trump’s sometimes-favorite all-news cable service, Fox News Channel, even as the business around it is shrinking. Though Fox News has long had cable TV’s oldest average viewership, it remains the most-watched, certainly among the three all-news competitors. But what would a Fox merger mean for CNN Worldwide, which is part of WBD? CNN’s cable network is habitually third in ratings these days, even as Chairman and CEO Mark Thompson continues to build up a thriving online side. The service tacked to the political center after the Warner Bros. Discovery merger 2.5 years ago, but still enrages Trump routinely. Is CNN headed to a private-equity spinoff or the sort of billionaire side project that has kept afloat (sometimes with plenty of controversy) such outlets as the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Time, and The Atlantic? It’s even possible, Fishman wrote, that as Netflix continues to build out its ad-supported operations (still less than three years old), it may consider either launching or acquiring its own AVOD platform to go with its premium, first-run subscription shows. “We would not be surprised to see Netflix explore either launching their own FAST service or even acquiring an AVOD platform as advertising becomes a more meaningful driver of its revenue in the years ahead,” Fishman wrote. During the ARF’s OTT Conference, Nielsen’s SVP, Product Strategy & Thought Leadership Brian Fuhrer suggested that one underreported story is how well some media companies are integrating and cross-promoting programming across streaming, broadcast and cable. “A lot of people said you're giving too much of an advantage by zeroing in on streamers,” Fuhrer said in recounting the challenges Nielsen has had capturing viewership in its The Gauge reports. “For companies with assets in multiple categories, (critics said) you’re not showing how they stack up.” Indeed, over the summer, with children out of school and football out of season, four different media companies took turns at No. 1 in total viewership, most notably NBCUniversal and Peacock, which dominated August with record viewing of the Summer Olympics in Paris, and shifted its share of viewership by 4.9 points. “It's really pretty extraordinary,” Fuhrer said. “We'll be looking back on these Olympics as a use case for a long time to come. They really leaned into every asset they had and connected it to consumers. The ability to meet people where they are, in categories they want to use, that's one of the things people have under-appreciated. There's a halo effect back and forth. I think this is an underappreciated opportunity to understand what’s working here.” Streaming has become the way most viewers under 35 are watching “TV,” Fuhrer said. Streaming comprises about 80 percent of their view time, especially when gaming is removed from the analysis. Older audiences split their viewership more evenly across cable, broadcast and streaming. That analysis leaves out streaming-only Netflix and Youtube, as well as Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video. They’re doing just fine without those legacy linear operations, it would appear. But there’s hope, Fuhrer suggested, for the traditional media companies in Hollywood to do far better than they have. Broadcasting makes up about 22.6 percent of view time in the United States, while cable still attracts another 26.1 percent. Together, that’s less than half of viewtime these days, but still notable. What’s more remarkable, Fuhrer said, is the patterns that remain intact in peak viewing across platforms. The biggest viewership still happens on Super Bowl Sunday, New Year’s Eve and Thanksgiving. Football drives a lot of that. A Thursday Night Football game on Amazon Prime will generate between 2.3 billion and 2.9 billion live streaming minutes, Fuhrer said. He compared that to Netflix’s most watched series in September, The Perfect Couple, with about 500 million streaming minutes. “Football is really impactful and really different,” Fuhrer said. But what he called “The Netflix Effect” is expanding. By that, he was referring to the vast new audience Netflix generated when it licensed NBCUniversal’s decade-old cable hit Suits. Now other media companies are figuring out how to promote shows across all their distribution platforms. “Cross-platform promotion to reach non-viewers can work in both directions, linear to streaming and streaming to linear,” Fuhrer said. “The Netflix Effect isn't limited to Netflix anymore. The ability to promote streaming content to linear audiences, that's a valuable commodity and I think is under-appreciated.” While there’s hope here for a way out of the morass facing traditional studios, there’s still plenty of griping, as suggested by Needham & Co. Senior Analyst Laura Martin, based on a dinner she had with a group of senior Hollywood executives. Among the gripes, she wrote: “Streaming is a lousy business, compared with the linear TV bundle. Not only does it typically have only one (revenue) stream instead of two, but streaming's ad loads are well below linear TV, and its total (advertising revenues) are relatively small (typically around 10% of linear TV). Also, churn is MUCH higher for streaming than linear TV, where 2-3 year agreements were the norm. The transition from linear to streaming has been a material downdraft for economics for the traditional media companies, with no end in sight, they all agreed.” Not everything Netflix touches turns to gold, of course. The company’s new film chief, Dan Lin, is the latest to propose making fewer but better films, in contrast to predecessor Scott Stuber’s “stuff-the-pipeline” approach, epitomized by a post-pandemic plan to produce an eye-popping 70 films per year. That led to plenty of criticism about underdeveloped or copycat projects, perhaps inevitable with such an ambitious slate. Lin also is hoping to be more targeted in how Netflix spends its money, throwing fewer wads of upfront cash at big names while perhaps, perhaps, shifting away from its standard approach, and giving at least some talent a chance to share in the back-end profits of successful projects. Netflix is also reducing at least some ambitions on the game side, where it recently shut down a development studio focused on a AAA title. Netflix is hardly the only media company having game-industry headaches, with layoffs the past year affecting pretty much every major publisher. But it’s another area where the largess of the pandemic era and recovery has been significantly pulled back, and new priorities set. All of which suggests that even the victor in the Streaming Wars may still have some work to do to get ready for the next era of media in Hollywood. One Community. Many Voices.

Hearing some things are afoot in New Zealand too. What a horrible day. It's not a full on government collapse like Germany, but it does sound concerningly right wing https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/new-zealand-treaty-of-waitangi-founding-document-changes-bill-parliament And people want us to have hope for the world. How? Genuinely how? florence + the machine really weren't lying when she sang "i'm always in this twilight" I had a genuine thought today when I went out to the orthodontist and to get cat food and saw people with Trump flags on their cars and wearing all their MAGA merch that maybe it's time to get a gun, especially since my pit bull died and she did a damned good job of being threatening to anyone looking the wrong way at my house. That's the mental state I'm in right now, especially since I live in a rural part of the south (albeit NC which needs to figure out if they're Republican or Democrat because elected Trump and then Democrats for statewide office ???). I'm thinking of all the women opting out of dating/marrying/sleeping with men (I'm never letting one of those filthy devils touch me ever again) and the potential increase of SA from frustrated men. I'm def considering a gun. Ugh we really are living in a repeat of the 1920s/30s. Lindner was basically blocking every good idea the Dems/Greens had and only thought about himself and his rich party friends. He always had the least support in the polls but acted like HE was the leader. Basically a toddler, "if it doesn't go my way I'm not doing it".This was probably the outcome he wanted because he was already cuddling with the conservatives the past months. He's hoping that he will somehow make it in the parliament again next election and can form a coalition with them. Lindner is an ass and intentionally sabotaged the whole thing from the start. He wants to be part of the government but he also wants to be the one who is in charge which he obviously wouldn't be as the smallest partner in a coalition of 3 parties. So he's also playing opposition to his own coalition and basically keeping them hostage every time they have to figure out the finances. And now we've reached the point where SPD and Greens had enough. Scholz gave a speech that was a basically a big "fuck this guy!" explaining why he fired him for the good of the country. I guess it's now because we'd have elections next year anyway and the proposed timeline would only move things forward 6 months. I think in a way it's also a bit of a last-ditch effort to save face for Scholz, because he was a pretty weak leader. The coalition definitely struggled thanks to Lindner, but Scholz didn't do anyone any favours by not reigning him in earlier.

(Bloomberg) -- Precision Neuroscience Corp., a brain implant rival to Elon Musk’s Neuralink Corp., has raised $93 million of a planned $100 million funding round, according to a person familiar with the situation. The deal valued the startup at about $500 million. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The fresh fundraising gives the company a boost as it seeks to take on Neuralink, which has raised over $685 million, and other companies in the space including Science, which has raised $150 million. A spokeswoman for Precision declined to comment. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows the company had filed to raise as much as $150 million. Precision was founded in 2021 by neurosurgeon Ben Rapoport, a co-founder of Neuralink, and Chief Executive Officer Michael Mager. Last year, it raised $41 million. Startups working on brain implants and related technology, or brain-machine interfaces, have gained considerable momentum in recent months. Neuralink’s device went into its first human patient as part of a trial earlier this year. And a team at the University of California, Davis, implanted an ALS patient with a device that allowed him to speak via a machine with unprecedented accuracy by reading his brain signals. Precision’s device is called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface, referring to the six layers that comprise the cerebral cortex, and represents a compromise between invasive and noninvasive brain-computer interface technologies. It requires surgery and slicing into the skull, but not into the tissue of the brain. Instead, the device sits on top of the organ, a method the company says avoids damaging any of that brain’s tissue. That’s a contrast with devices from companies including Blackrock Neurotech, Inbrain Neuroelectronics SL, Neuralink and Paradromics, which sit within brain tissue. A device from Synchron enters the brain like a stent, via blood vessels, and ultimately sits near the brain’s motor cortex. Another company, Science, says it’s working on devices that can sit both on or in brain tissue. Precision’s device is not yet greenlit by regulators, but it is in testing. The startup has implanted its device in several patients, albeit temporarily during surgeries, where the primary purpose was related to another goal, such as removing brain tumors. While the surgery is underway and with the patient’s permission, the Precision team puts its Layer 7 in place and uses it to detect neurological signals. The company has applied for Food and Drug Administration approval of a version of its device for temporary use for monitoring in hospital settings, and has said it hopes to have it on the market next year. That would provide a revenue stream to the fledgling company as it works on its other device: a permanent implant to treat paralysis. Such a device, if it works, is years from approval and commercial deployment. In a recent surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, Precision tested placing four of its microelectrode arrays — each one-fifth the thickness of a human hair — on the surface of a patient brain. Each array contains 1,024 electrodes, so deploying four arrays gives a total of 4,096, creating an unusually high level of detail. Competitors have far fewer. Neuralink’s device, for example, has 1,024 electrodes.

Full Content:
Last week I had the privilege to attend the inaugural New York BCI Symposium, a one-of-a-kind gathering that validated the astonishing popular appeal of BCI by spotlighting the field’s future opportunities and present-day limitations. The heady lineup featured over thirty experts including researchers, neurosurgeons, founders, advocates, and federal leaders, drawing a packed house of attendees spanning students, clinicians, investors and executives from around the world. Aligned in our common curiosity and interests, we mingled and traded perspectives on all things BCI. The two-day event was co-hosted by Mount Sinai BioDesign and the Department of Neurosurgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at the New York Academy of Medicine. Presentations spanned key discussions in breakthrough methods, commercial strategy, ethics, and research initiatives. Speakers represented numerous programs from Mount Sinai’s network of interdisciplinary departments for brain health, suggesting that the world’s leading neurotech innovation ecosystem might be developing at New York City’s biggest hospital system. Mount Sinai Health System's world-class neurotech ecosystem is foundational for the future of BCI. But the hosts transcended an empire state of mind, inviting experts from competing New York hospitals, and brain trusts from Boston, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, London, and the Netherlands. Such cross-pollination has been essential to the BCI field thus far, and serves as a testament to the collegial leadership of Dr. Joshua Bederson. As the system chair of neurosurgery and executive director of the biodesign program at Mount Sinai, Bederson’s earnest emceeing centered humility over hype and set the tone for two days of collaborative learning and discussion. The two BCI sponsors of the event, Synchron and Precision Neuroscience, offered dual visions of what an “interface” can be across numerous sessions. Synchron’s strategy bets on speed over size. Their minimally invasive Stentrode, whose endovascular insertion time is down to just 20 minutes, reliably translates signals into digital motor outputs to navigate a growing ecosystem of applications. Despite a relatively modest 16-channel array, Synchron’s focus on pragmatism and execution has garnered valuable respect and mindshare among neurosurgeons, federal officials, and the investor community. As an earlier stage company, Precision has chosen to optimize for the future over the immediate-term. Their “Layer 7” thin film array has 1024 electrodes in a flexible device that conforms to the cortex. While it has only been used in exploratory studies thus far, implantations will occur via a <1mm incision; once made the “micro-electrocorticography” array (micro-ECoG) will take about 20 seconds to place. The ability to record and stimulate at a field-leading volume will take longer to arrive in market, but likely offer greater options to build value for users when it does. Precision Neuroscience and Synchron anchored the symposium as sponsors Here are my top five sessions (actually, seven) focused on the most critical characters in the evolving narrative about BCI’s future: Brain health experts who founded companies to translate research and transform practice, and the early group of end users who’ve had actual skin in the game, known and celebrated as BCI Pioneers. Doug Weber, co-director at the NeuroMechatronics Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University set the stage. His “why, what, how” history of major BCI milestones unfolded through six Pioneers’ stories, starting in 1996 with Marjorie Hirschberg, and continuing with with Phil Kennedy, Matt Nagle, Jan Scheurmann and Ian Burkhart, before stopping in 2015 with Nathan Copeland, who remains the world’s longest actively implanted (and most artistically prolific) user. Doug Weber from Carnegie Mellon kicked off the Symposium with an overview of BCI Pioneers and key ... [+] milestones. Weber also leveraged his broad industry experience as co-founder and CTO of Reach Neuro and advisor to numerous neurotech startups to frame two major challenges: First is accurately defining the market, which will involve validating and benchmarking outcomes against current alternatives for end users. Second is the umbrella of ethical, legal, social implications (ELSI) posed by real world adoption. This spans a diverse, cross-functional, and challenging mix of topics including data and device security, user agency, accessibility, equitability, policy reforms and more. While digital device control, a primarily “read” use case, remains the first focal area for most commercial BCI, efficacy trials are still needed “to understand where specific benefits are, and how uniform they are across a population,” which payers will require for reimbursement considerations. Weber also spoke to movement disorders, mental illness, and stroke recovery as expansion markets that could combine BCI with neuromodulation (“write.”) Across subsequent tracks, it became evident that the post-research, read-and-write future of BCI is not that far away. Chad Bouton, a professor and VP of Advanced Engineering at Northwell Health’s Feinstein Institutes, presented a case study on “neural bypass.” This procedure pairs spinal cord stimulation and BCI to produce cortical mirroring around the site of injury. By exciting or “priming” the spinal cord, this approach can create enough neural plasticity to restore limited sensations, and enhance physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve strength and motor control for people who have lost independence through injury. Today, this remains a research effort requiring highly personalized surgical interventions and rehabilitation, rather than any off-the-shelf options. In response to a question about where neural bypasses will be in five years, Bouton emphasized his lab’s research focus to “promote plasticity any way we can” and the need for a commercial ecosystem of wearable stimulation with onboard AI that can pair with BCI systems and work from users’ homes. The subject of Bouton’s case study, Keith Thomas, who became paralyzed from the chest down after a diving accident, was in the room with his sister to receive a rousing round of applause. In a brief chat with Bouton, Thomas and his sister after the session, I was moved by the trio’s banter and the depth of their connection, and grateful for the siblings’ candid input when asked how BCI could better serve users and caregivers today. I’ll explore this critical topic in future articles. David Putrino, PhD, a professor at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine, opened this session with an overview of his lab’s approach to “rehabilitation and human performance.” This involves partnering with patients to adopt and adapt various neurotechnologies as part of active treatment, as well as working with regulatory agencies and payors to promote patient access outside of research settings. Putrino contrasted the impairment-focused medical model of disability with the social model, which works to remove or mitigate barriers to human performance. In this frame, BCI is arriving at a crossroads moment, wherein innovation is expanding from compensation (e.g. water bottle grippers for people without finger control) to restoration through things like functional electrical stimulation. He was joined on the stage by Christopher Kellner, MD, an associate professor of Neurosurgery who oversees various programs in care delivery, research, and training in the field of intracerebral care. Kellner’s work entails use of numerous FDA-cleared neurotechnologies, from implanted devices for vagus nerve stimulation, to wearable sleeves paired with a non-invasive brain interface. David Putrino and Christopher Kellner's cross-functional, interdisciplinary collaboration spanning ... [+] neurotech, neurosurgery, PT & Rehab, and arm-wrestling insurers has helped patients like Katie regain functional independence after a stroke. The highlight of the track was hearing from a patient named Katie, who worked with both Kellner and Putrino to regain independence after a devastating stroke in 2019 left her paralyzed down her left side. Only in her early 30’s with a two year old at home, Katie was hospitalized for five months during the Covid-19 pandemic, which involved intensive physical, occupational, and speech therapy, which helped but still left her with limited arm strength at discharge. After two years of haggling with three different insurers, Katie gained access to Medicare which enabled her to join Kellner’s trial for a vagus nerve stimulation implant. She described the surgery as “not bad,” the six weeks of additional rehab as “you get out what you put in,” and the treatment as “life-changing,” adding that “you can feel your brain rewiring, you can feel the neuroplasticity.” With her young daughter in the audience watching her mom on stage, Katie’s story represents both the possibilities of neurotech-enabled stroke care today, and the fiendish limitations too many Americans face from their health plans. It struck that Mount Sinai’s collaborative, interdisciplinary, tech-savvy, and practically oriented clinical model remains an exception rather than a norm compared to most health systems. The only thing better than watching videos of BCI Pioneers bending and breaking limits - speaking cybernetically, fistbumping presidents, playing games, making art - is hearing from them directly. Ian Burkhart took the stage numerous times to share his expert perspective as a liaison to the FDA, President of NASIC, philanthropic leader, published researcher, and all around advocate. In a chat with CNBC’s Ashley Capoot, he shared the story of his spinal cord injury and his clinical trial in 2014 that implanted him with a Blackrock Neuroport array. Seven years of clinical studies included a neural bypass procedure using technology from Battelle that temporarily reanimated his hand well enough to play Guitar Hero. In 2021, Burkhart was “explanted” when the trial’s funding ran out and a scalp infection developed around his implant. His perspective is that BCI represents an aspiration to deliver improvements over today’s available assistive technologies. When asked about wanting another BCI, he didn’t hesitate to say yes, but demurred that his eligibility remains in question due to prior history, and that now, “the bar is higher for what I would want.” At the top of his list are a fully implanted device to reduce odds of infection, a duration of at least ten years, and in-home functionality rather than limited access in the lab. Ian Burkhart & Ashley Capoot of CNBC spoke about how BCI can evolve from a research domain to a ... [+] field of patient care In another session, Burkhart joined Blair Casey, executive director of Team Gleason, and Jennifer French, MBA, for a nuanced discussion on the path forward in BCI. French lives with tetraplegia as a result of a snowboarding accident, and the extent of her neurotechnology advocacy and leadership cannot be understated. Her expertise founding and leading Neurotech Network, NASIC, and the iBCI-CC over the last decade were on display in a masterclass on pre-commercial strategy for the nascent BCI industry, from trust-building and hype mitigation, to functional indication roadmaps for people living with spinal cord injuries, to scaling community engagement for participation in clinical trials. Selling false hope about complete recovery and restoration via BCI should be avoided by all, and especially by my peers who work in media, marketing, and market research. Key trends for the industry to navigate include shrinking rehab times for spinal cord injury, low clinician awareness and access to new tech, and the need to “jump the chasm” from engaging people enrolled in BCI registries to engaging the broader community of those affected. Max Hodak, founder and CEO of Science Corp, shared their vision restoration pivotal trial, in which a photovoltaic stimulating array implanted at the back of blind patients’ retinas, paired with special eyeglasses, restored the ability to see for the vast majority of the trial’s 38 participants. The implant, acquired in a commercial chess move this spring, is a solar-powered marvel the size of confetti that fits perfectly over Abe Lincoln on a penny’s tail. Through the company’s foundry and a new full stack of BCI tools, Science could bring the cost of in-human BCI development down by a factor of 20. Hodak’s broader vision for BCI is grounded yet groundbreaking. Hodak was joined on the stage by Precision Neuroscience’s CSO Ben Rapoport, Synchron’s CEO Tom Oxley, Blackrock Neurotech’s CSO Florian Solzbacher, Paradromics’ CSO Vikash Gilja and and Meta’s (formerly co- founder of CTRL-Labs) Patrick Kaifosh. Moderated by Bloomberg Reporter Sarah McBride, the discussion covered a number of emerging industry tensions: standardizing outputs from differentiated systems, collaboration versus competition, demonstrating value to patients versus payors, and prioritizing technical optimization versus real world pragmatism in allocating limited time and money. Regulatory strategy, payer and clinician engagement, and AI filled a bulk of the Q&A. The diversity of technologies, form factors, invasiveness, user base and other factors limited the depth and generalizability of this conversation, but two key themes emerged: the need to focus on effective productization over technical perfection, and the tailored approach to designing clinical outcomes. The latter will make standardization in this nascent industry a challenge (more on that below.) In conversation on AI’s role in BCI, participants summarized technical advances in ML for signal processing or deep learning for chip design, as well as generative AI. LLMs can match or mimic the “art of human expression” as part of a product, or speed up the pdf-laden burdens of regulatory compliance, quality assurance, and other mission-critical operational obligations in building a class III medical device company. Based on the brainpower and leadership on this stage, the future of the industry appears in good hands. From left to right: Sarah McBride (Bloomberg), Ben Rapoport (Precision), Tom Oxley (Synchron), ... [+] Florian Solzbacher (Blackrock), Vikash Gilja (Paradromics), Patrick Kaifosh (CTRL Labs/Meta), Max Hodak (Science) Many if not most of the sessions I attended began by summarizing BCI history, underscoring the robust foundation of knowledge, tools, and practice that clinical researchers have built for the last two decades. But even as scores of brilliant neuroengineers advance technical innovations and test experimental interventions in research settings, the various experts on stage echoed the plain view that industry is the engine that will drive this field forward for the next two decades, for better or for worse. The BCI Industrial Revolution is Underway (from Doug Weber's opening session) This set up the billion dollar question: What will the future hold for BCI startups? According to investors, it’s actually hundreds of billions. Alex Morgan, partner at Khosla Ventures and investor in Synchron and other neurotech startups, framed the opportunity as an unprecedented convergence of historic advances in measurement, materials and other technologies, from AI to AR and much in between. In a later session, Dr. Benjamin Rapoport of Precision Neuroscience referred to this confluent phenomenon as “Moore’s Law for Applied Neuroscience,” with a growth curve mapping electrode channel count over the last 50 years. In Morgan’s words, BCI (and other non-implanted neurotech) “will give us a fine-grained attenuation of the electrical network in the manner we want, when we want.” Thus, he argued, if the 20th century was the century of the heart, where a similar multi-faceted revolution in cardiology innovation now “creates over $300b in value a year” by augmenting lifespan and healthspan, then the 21st century will belong to the brain. But as we enter the second quarter of the century, the BCI industry today has yet to put any points on the board, in terms of adding economic value to people’s lives. Khosla Ventures' Alex Morgan framed the convergence of neurotechnology innovation as the Century of ... [+] the Brain. One attendee I met at lunch smirked that BCI appears to be a solution looking for a problem, a view plenty of others share. I’ve personally met or heard from too many BCI Pioneers to agree. His point was well-taken though, that reimbursement is hard, and navigating the market opportunity comes down to a specific (if daunting) set of “known unknowns” that emerged over the two days. A mentor of mine, Dr. Jordan Shlain, cautions against mistaking a clear view for a short distance. Simply put, the road ahead will be hard. Advancing the field of BCI will depend on several factors that emerged over multiple sessions, as well as the new reality of highly unpredictable federal leadership, whose impact over the next four years at FDA, CMS, and other agencies remains to be seen. As per David McMullen, the FDA’s director of the office of neurological & physical medicine devices, regulatory science at the agency entails “developing new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety and performance of the products it regulates.” His new boss, Michele Tarver, has a history of patient-centered public-private partnerships. McMullen divulged his career-long interest in BCI prior to joining the feds and listed numerous efforts underway to engage BCI stakeholders and, in particular, accelerate market success through TAP (“FDA Breakthrough on steroids”), specific funding mechanisms, and aligning COA. Jen French also identified informing regulatory science as a key goal of the iBCI-CC, describing the group’s work as a “pre-competitive sandbox” to develop technical and clinical standards, user preferences, endpoints economic analysis. These efforts are bolstered by the work of researchers like Abbey Sawyer, a postdoctoral fellow who shared her work in developing digital “activities of daily living” to leverage clinical trials for broader impact. Abbey Sawyer shared insights about how to measure the impact of BCI in clinical research. And yet: Despite the bonhomie, mutual respect, and promising rhetoric, the reality is that alignment will be challenging. In the BCI startup panel, after describing how nuances in product and procedures will drive differences in trial design and clinical outcomes, Tom Oxley summed it up: “Everyone wants to do something slightly different.” Persuading payers to cover BCI will undeniably become the field’s top goal. McMullen’s counterpart on the symposium’s closing panel was TJ Sutphin, Ombudsman for Pharma and Tech at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Sutphin also spoke at the aforementioned COA session for BCI last month. His primer covered coding and coverage channels, “innovator’s guide” resources, and touched on coverage decisions for speech generating devices, DBS, cochlear implants, and other topics. Despite the airtime, I felt that he offered little insight to CMS’s specific thinking about BCI. This is underscores the need to recruit health plan medical directors and commercial reimbursement leaders from Medtronic, Boston Scientific, or other neuromodulation companies to future discussions about BCI. The job of CMS, and to a lesser extent, FDA, is to be reactive to engagement from BCI companies, moreso than act as proactive partners. Mount Sinai has an opportunity - I would argue, an imperative - to leverage their market relationships as an experienced health system and invite their insurer counterparts into the room in future iterations of this event. This would amount to two-way opportunity for payers to educate attendees on their thought process and perspectives, and absorb key insights on the benefits and value of BCI from some of the world’s leading experts. Patient advocacy will bridge the divide between clinical research and commercial success. Across the two days, Pioneer voices and videos were elevated on the stage in a way that transcended marketing or storytelling; at this early stage, each and every BCI user represents a highly valuable and slightly different case study filled with technical, clinical, practical, and socioeconomic insights that remain largely underleveraged. Rather than asking Pioneers like Burkhart to repeat their stories, the field needs to lean on their detailed market research, numerous publications, federal advocacy efforts, strategic philanthropy, and other insights. Commercial success will require integrating BCI into smart homes, navigating limits of disability policy and routes to reimplantation, and improving ethics of clinical trials. An example of the latter came from Dan Rubin, Assistant Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School/Mass General, where BCI trial participants can “reconsent” twice, for up to an additional seven years of using their BCI following the end of their trial. Caregiver perspectives were infrequently mentioned in the sessions I attended. BCI cannot cure paralysis, so family members and caregivers have a critical role in expanding conversations on decentralizing clinical research, exploring economic evidence generation around time and costs, and configuring BCI for communication and in-home deployment. The latter was explored briefly by Mariska J. Vansteensel from UMC Utrecht Brain Center in a case study about “nocturnal caregiver calling” that drew questions from BCI executives in the audience, suggesting that such key explorations of daily living should not be relegated to academic research. Like the titles of many presenters, this recap has become a bit long, so I’ll close with a powerful framing by Peter Yoo, Synchron’s Senior Director of Neuroscience and Algorithms. In designing functional systems in dynamic interplay between hardware, software, and the end user, Yoo spoke about balancing reliability off the shelf, and adaptability to account for individual customization and technical advances: “This isn’t just a simple engineering challenge. When the human is in the loop, it impacts the whole system.” BCI then, is more than a field of research, a technology product or a commercial market. It’s a platform for optimizing the common boundaries of computers and human beings. The next era will not spin out from technical revolutions in a laboratory, but by helping people in their homes. Like the word BCI itself, it’s easier said than done. For all the students, engineers, doctors, executives, and others working in this field, the future is not just undeniably bright - it’s here.

Google is lowering the minimum amount of memory required for new Android TV devices… but increasing the amount needed for Google TV. The Mozilla Foundation is laying off a significant portion of its team. Microsoft plans to launch a preview of its controversial Recall feature for Copilot+ PCs by December. And the European Union is investigating whether Corning’s exclusivity deals with phone and tablet makers that use Gorilla Glass is a violation of antitrust rules. Here’s a roundup of recent tech news from around the web. Corning’s Gorilla Glass is used to offer protection for many, many phones and tablets. The EU wants to know if the exclusivity deals Corning has signed with device makers has made it difficult for rivals to compete in this space. Google has lowered the minimum amount of RAM needed for Android TV devices from 1.5 GB to 1GB, which should enable hardware makers to produce cheaper products. But Google TV (which is built on Android TV) requires 2GB (which is more than the latest Chromecast with Google TV HD has). The non-profit foundation behind the Firefox web browser and Thunderbird email client is eliminating two divisions as part of the layoffs: advocacy for “privacy, inclusion, and decentralization of technologies” and global programs. Nintendo says the upcoming game console will be backward compatible, meaning you should be able to play Switch games on the Switch 2 (or whatever it’s called). The Nintendo Switch Online service will also work with the new console. “Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date. This summer Fairphone launched an Android 14 update for the Fairphone 5 and said it would bring the update to the Fairphone 4 by September. Now the company says it’s taking longer than planned, and assistance from Qualcomm is needed. More details should be available by early 2025. Microsoft says the controversial Recall feature for Windows 11 will be available in preview for Copilot+ PCs by December. The company had delayed the launch in order to make changes in response to privacy & security concerns. Intel Lunar Lake chips feature on-package LPDDR5x-8533 memory which saves space and reduces latency and power consumption. But it also drives up the price, so Intel says it’s a one-off. Future Intel chips won’t have integrated RAM. Keep up on the latest headlines by following @[email protected] on Mastodon. You can also follow Liliputing on Threads, Facebook, and X.

Title: A new stronger Ozempic is coming. Here's what to know

Time Published: 2024-11-06T19:10:35Z

Novo Nordisk (NVO+2.18%) teased some new details about a potential Ozempic successor during a call with investors Tuesday. The Danish pharma giant fielded several questions from interested analysts about its next-gen GLP-1 medication CagriSema, regarding its efficacy, safety, and supply chain. Novo Nordisk is known for its blockbuster GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+2.79%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Now, the company is working on a sequel. Novo Nordisk is currently developing an even more potent obesity and diabetes treatment. CagriSema combines semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, with an amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist. Amylin helps regulate blood sugar levels, similar to GLP-1, while calcitonin controls calcium levels in the blood. A previous early-stage clinical trial of CagriSema found it helped patients lose on average 15.6% of their weight over 32 weeks. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy led to an average of 15% weight loss after 68 weeks in clinical trials. However, Novo Nordisk executive president of development Martin Holst Lange told analysts he has “confidence” that larger trials will show CagriSema will help users lose up to 25% of their weight. Lange said the company used data from previous trials to arrive at that number. The company said that results for two late-stage trials of the drug are expected later this year and in the first half of 2025. Novo Nordisk said the safety and tolerability of this new drug is expected to be similar to current GLP-1 drugs on the market, based on previous trials. Novo Nordisk chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen said the decision to externally outsource a component of the new drug was the “rational choice” based “on a consideration around capabilities and manufacturing footprints.” He added the company is learning from its experience producing current GLP-1 drugs. “We take historic learnings with us in terms of ensuring that we have a resilient setup into the future for external sourcing approaches,” Knudsen said. In the past few years, Novo Nordisk has failed to produce enough GLP-1 meds to meet demand, which has resulted in shortages. The company is now investing billions to increase its manufacturing capacity. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Amazon’s Andy Jassy denies its 5-day-a-week RTO plan is a secret way to reduce headcount
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/11/06/amazon-andy-jassy-5-day-rto-not-backdoor-layoff/
Time Published: 2024-11-06T18:52:36Z

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is demanding employees come into the office five days a week, but it’s not because he secretly wants them to quit, he said. Jassy announced the company’s strict return-to-office mandate in a September memo, sparking immediate outrage from employees, some of which had been working at least two days remotely per week since May 2023. Some experts have theorized that Jassy’s RTO plan could be a sneaky way of reducing the company’s headcount, rather than go through the formal process of conducting layoffs. Yet, in an all-hands meeting Tuesday, Jassy denied claims that the RTO plan was a “backdoor layoff” or that the company had reached some agreement with city leaders. “I can tell you both of those are not true. You know, this was not a cost play for us. This is very much about our culture and strengthening our culture,” he said, according to a transcript reported by Reuters. Following the September RTO announcement, 73% of employees surveyed by anonymous job review site Blind said they had considered quitting in light of the new policy. Other employees quickly took to LinkedIn to change their status to #opentowork in hopes of finding a more flexible position. But in the company’s Amazon Web Services unit, CEO Matt Garman was clear that the naysayers could go elsewhere. “If there are people who just don’t work well in that environment and don’t want to, that’s okay, there are other companies around,” Garman said on an internal call last month, referencing the company’s RTO policy, Reuters reported. To make clear their frustration with the RTO policy, hundreds of AWS employees signed a letter last month protesting the change, calling it an “outright abdication” of AWS’s role as an innovator and industry leader. To be sure, Amazon has offered employees commuter benefits and subsidized parking, among other perks to help ease the transition. In the memo from September, Jassy said it’s easier for employees to learn and collaborate while in person. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Amazon told Fortune the RTO plan is meant to strengthen the company’s culture and ensure teams are connected. The RTO memo asked workers to go back to “the way we were before the onset of COVID,” and banned working from home except for extraordinary circumstances. Jassy pointed out in the memo that intense coding work or having a sick child were appropriate times to work from home with manager consent. While managers earlier this year received approval to fire employees who didn’t comply with the previous three-day in-office mandate, many still made changes to their lives based on Amazon’s flexibility. In the Tuesday all-hands meeting, Jasssy acknowledged the five-day RTO policy, which takes effect in January, would take some getting used to. “It is an adjustment. I understand that for a lot of people, and we’re going to be working through that adjustment together,” Jassy said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Trump win sparks big rally in stocks
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/11/6/trump-win-sparks-big-rally-in-stocks

Wall Street’s main indexes opened at record highs in anticipation of Trump’s pro-business approach. Donald Trump’s return as president of the United States for the second time has boosted equity markets on bets of lower corporate tax, favourable tariffs and deregulation, lifting shares of banks, locally focused small-cap companies and Trump Media. His promise to make Tesla CEO Elon Musk head of a government efficiency commission after the billionaire backed Trump throughout his electoral campaign led to a 12.5 percent surge in the shares of the electric carmaker. Wall Street’s main indexes opened at record highs, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped about 4.8 percent to its highest in nearly three years. “Business animal spirits could be rekindled once again from Trump’s pro-business approach which could lead to a more robust capital expenditures and investment environment,” said Jeff Schulze, market strategist at ClearBridge Investments. Trump Media & Technology Group, in which Trump owns a majority stake rose nearly 8 percent in choppy trading. Investors overlooked the company’s latest quarterly results that showed the Truth Social parent’s revenue was just $1m. The shares have more than tripled in value from their all-time lows in late September, and Trump’s stake was worth as much as $5.3bn, up from $3.9bn on Tuesday. Trump’s Republican Party also secured the Senate and was making gains in the House of Representatives, potentially making it easier for the president to legislate his proposals and push through key appointments. Markets “have priced in a pretty strong mandate for the Republicans and are biasing towards most of the Trump trades”, said Scott Chronert, US equity strategist at Citi. “Policy details will be important for here as the market focus seems to be putting more emphasis on deregulation, tax cuts, and a more business-friendly backdrop.” Wall Street lenders JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs jumped between 6 percent and 10 percent on prospects of improving domestic investment, looser regulations and more deals. “Trump’s win likely means some deregulation, including rolling back banking regulations, though Big Tech may remain a bipartisan antitrust focus,” strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a note. Semiconductor stocks advanced, with the Philadelphia chip index rising 1.8 percent and AI darling Nvidia gaining 2.7 percent despite Trump’s criticism of the US CHIPS and Science Act, which supports domestic chip manufacturing through subsidies. Trump has instead proposed tariffs on imported chips, particularly from Taiwan’s TSMC, whose US-listed shares dropped 3 percent. Oil stocks firmed 3.5 percent, while US renewable energy companies such as NextEra Energy and First Solar plunged 6 percent and 13 percent, respectively. Trump’s campaign laid out an energy policy platform centred around maximising US fuel and power output, in part by dismantling the Biden administration’s efforts to fight climate change. While Tesla shares surged on Musk-Trump proximity, stocks of other electric carmakers dipped as Trump had said he would consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. Rivian Automotive dropped 8 percent and Nikola slipped about 1.4 percent. “Nobody is making money in EVs aside from Tesla, so the reduction or elimination of EV credits will widen Tesla’s competitive moat,” said Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. Fears of escalation in Sino-US tensions pressured US-listed China shares with iShares MSCI China ETF dropping nearly 2.4 percent. Import duties, including a 10 percent universal tariff on imports from all foreign countries and a 60 percent tariff on imports from China, are a key plank of Trump’s policies and likely to have the biggest global impact. Victory for Trump, who has positioned himself as pro-cryptocurrency, lifted Bitcoin to a record high. Crypto-linked stocks Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Riot Platforms, MARA Holdings jumped between 11 percent and 21 percent. Private prison operators Geo Group and CoreCivic jumped about more than 30 percent each as Trump’s promised crack down on undocumented immigration could boost demand for detention centres. US steel makers Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics and Nucor surged between 13 percent and 19 percent, with analysts having noted in the run-up to the election that a Trump presidency may mean rising protections for the domestic steel industry.

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded over $1 billion in trading volume within the first 20 minutes of market opening on November 6, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Damn, $IBIT has seen $1b in volume in the first 20min- that's about what it does in full day. Other bitcoin ETFs in same boat, crazy volume. Set for a record-breaking volume day (and given price is up so much, this is likely feeding frenzy volume vs crisis volume = look for… pic.twitter.com/1gSvV5Lwzo — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2024 At the time of writing, over $2.5 billion worth of IBIT shares traded hands, Coinglass data shows. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC saw around $464 million in volume, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC, per Coinglass. Trading volume, which represents both buying and selling activity, doesn’t directly translate to net inflows. For instance, of the $4.5 billion in first-day volume for Bitcoin ETFs, only about $600 million constituted actual inflows. Balchunas suggested that IBIT could end today with huge inflows. Historically, large volume spikes during a rally have often preceded significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, the analyst said. Remember the last time we saw volume spike during a rally? That was a precursor to the recent flow-athon, $IBIT alone took in $1.8b over next few days. Not saying it's guarantee but i'm fan of patterns and it fits pattern. https://t.co/YbkshZ5lOw — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2024 His projection was based on similar patterns observed on October 30, when IBIT’s trading volume surpassed $3.3 billion, which later converted into $643 million in net buying, Crypto Briefing reported. That marked the fund’s heaviest inflow since March 12 when Bitcoin neared $73,000. According to data tracked by Farside Investors, IBIT shed over $44 million yesterday. US spot Bitcoin ETFs also ended the day with approximately $117 million in net outflows, extending its losing streak to three consecutive days. The recent spike in IBIT trading comes amid Bitcoin’s price rally to around $74,400, up over 6% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin recently established a new record high of $75,358 on CoinGecko. The milestone was achieved against the backdrop of the 2024 US elections, with projections indicating that Donald Trump was set to secure a second term in office. Trump’s victory was later confirmed as major media outlets, including FOX News, the Associated Press, and NBC, officially declared him the winner of the 2024 election.

Title: Super Micro Computer stock bleeds 24% after it can’t even say when it will post actual earnings

Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI+12.25%) shares plummeted more than 24% on Wednesday after the AI hardware company released a disappointing preliminary first-quarter report and failed to confirm a timeline for its actual first-quarter results. The San Jose-based company, which missed the deadline for filing its annual report, is also facing a potential Nasdaq delisting. The company reported unaudited quarterly results on Tuesday after the market closed, leading to the sharp sell-off. This development follows the recent resignation of its auditor, Ernst & Young, which departed last week, citing disagreements over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. On Wednesday, the stock was trading near $21, marking a fresh 52-week low. Compared to its March peak of $123, the price has plunged over 82%, erasing over $55 billion in value. For the quarter ending September 30, Super Micro reported net sales between $5.9 billion and $6 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, which had forecasted $6.45 billion. The company’s forecast for the December quarter also fell short of expectations, and it projected revenue between $5.5 billion and $6.1 billion, which was below the consensus estimate of analysts of $6.86 billion. Additionally, Super Micro expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to range from 56 cents to 65 cents, while analysts had anticipated EPS of 83 cents. On Tuesday, the company made no mention of Ernst & Young’s departure or any ongoing corporate governance concerns. However, CEO Charles Liang did confirm that Super Micro is actively working to hire a new auditor. It’s important to note that the company has not reported audited financial results since May. Moreover, the company is facing potential delisting from the Nasdaq. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. The company makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI, and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+2.24% GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. CEO Liang said on Tuesday that the company is working closely with Nvidia and that the demand is strong. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX) on Value Investing by Double Alpha Factory’s Substack by Maksim. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GTX. Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX)'s share was trading at $7.34 as of Nov 4th. GTX’s trailing and forward P/E were 6.02 and 5.95 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A close up of an engine piston with a commercial turbocharger attached. Garrett Motion (GTX) operates as a key player in the mobility and industrial technology sector, focusing on high-performance turbocharging solutions for light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and industrial applications. Known for its mechanical and electrical turbo products, GTX caters to a broad spectrum of vehicle types, including gasoline, diesel, and natural gas engines, with some revenue now coming from its E-Boosting and hydrogen fuel cell compression solutions. As of 2023, GTX leads in turbochargers for internal combustion engines (ICEs), a critical technology that enables automakers to meet fuel efficiency and emission standards without sacrificing power or performance. This niche, heavily dominated by Garrett Motion and BorgWarner, has a high barrier to entry due to the technical complexity involved. Additionally, a significant portion of GTX's revenue is secured years in advance, with more than 80% of OEM sales planned four years ahead, providing solid visibility into future cash flows. Despite the auto industry's shift towards battery electric vehicles (BEVs), GTX’s turbo business remains resilient, with turbocharger penetration expected to exceed 50% in ICE-based vehicles through 2030. As BEV adoption has slowed due to infrastructure, cost, and consumer preference challenges, hybrids—where turbo penetration is even higher—are likely to account for a larger portion of future vehicles. This benefits GTX, as hybrids require more advanced turbo systems, which offer higher margins. Moreover, GTX’s commercial and industrial applications, such as backup power generators and marine engines, represent a significant growth area, accounting for about 30% of total sales and offering higher profitability than light vehicle applications. This segment continues to expand, especially in sectors like marine and backup power, where demand is surging due to their role in ensuring stable power for critical infrastructure, such as data centers. CEO commentary from recent earnings calls reflects GTX's confidence in the durability of its turbo business, which caters to both diesel and natural gas engines for high-demand applications like locomotives and off-highway vehicles. In terms of financials, GTX projects substantial free cash flow (FCF) generation over the next five years. Management estimates between $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion in FCF, with the lower end of this forecast still translating to a FCF yield of approximately 20% based on its current market capitalization of around $1.6-$1.7 billion. This robust FCF, along with GTX’s forward sales visibility, makes it likely that the company could repurchase its entire outstanding share base within five years, even after allocating around $0.5 billion toward new zero-emission technologies. Given the current 41% BEV penetration assumption in these projections—an aggressive forecast—GTX’s outlook could improve further if BEV adoption rates continue to lag. The slow pace of the BEV transition, noted at the 2024 J.P. Morgan Automotive Conference, reinforces the durability of GTX's revenue base, as the turbocharger market retains a long tail of demand. Recent discussions, including those from major industry events and political forums, highlight various challenges facing BEV adoption, such as prohibitive costs, consumer hesitancy, and infrastructure inadequacies. In Europe, for example, the ambitious goal to ban non-BEV vehicles by 2035 faces substantial resistance, with auto executives and government officials questioning the feasibility of such rapid changes. In the U.S., adoption rates for BEVs are likewise decelerating, as indicated by recent regulatory shifts to ease tailpipe standards. The Biden administration, for instance, reduced its BEV adoption targets amid political and industry feedback. Meanwhile, automakers are doubling down on hybrids, which offer a balance between emission reduction and operational efficiency. Companies like Ford and General Motors are pivoting to hybrids due to profitability concerns, reinforcing GTX’s position in the evolving vehicle mix. In China, EV manufacturers are increasingly exploring hybrid technologies, acknowledging the profitability and flexibility advantages of hybrid systems over pure BEVs. Garrett's sustained focus on hybrids and ICE solutions aligns well with these market shifts, positioning it as a critical supplier for automakers facing stringent efficiency mandates but limited by BEV scalability issues. From an investment perspective, Garrett Motion's (GTX) valuation is attractive, trading at a discount relative to its cash flow potential. With a market cap of approximately $1.6 to $1.7 billion, GTX is projected to generate $1.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the next five years. This cash flow can be utilized for substantial stock buybacks, potentially enhancing shareholder value and driving the stock price higher. The company’s diverse revenue streams, particularly in expanding commercial and industrial applications, provide resilience amid uncertainties in the transition to battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In a worst-case scenario, investors can anticipate a 20% return over the next five years, followed by a 10% return in subsequent years, indicating a solid margin of safety. Comparatively, GTX's closest competitor, BorgWarner, trades at free cash flow yields of around 8-10%, about half of GTX’s yield. This difference implies a potential upside of 50-100% for GTX if the market aligns its valuation with that of BorgWarner. The investment thesis is based on GTX's strong market position, ongoing demand for internal combustion engines (ICE) and hybrid vehicles, clear revenue visibility, diversification into high-margin industrial applications, and robust free cash flow generation. Collectively, these factors underscore GTX's status as an undervalued entity with significant upside potential, particularly if the transition to BEVs is slower than anticipated. Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 32 hedge fund portfolios held GTX at the end of the second quarter which was 35 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GTX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GTX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Nvidia is now worth more than Meta and Amazon combined. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The AI hype is in full throttle, as Nvidia is now the largest company in the world by market cap. With a market capitalization of $3.52 trillion, Nvidia has effectively dethroned Apple for the second time this year. This news follows developments in the stock market, with Nvidia's shares surging by 2.72% this morning. All top leaders had a bullish start to the day, but a 0.64% uptick wasn't enough for Apple to hold off the green storm. Nvidia now stands as the world's largest company by market cap, but will it be able to defend its position? If so, for how long? A deeper dive into Nvidia's stock shows that just one year ago, its market cap stood at roughly $1.1 trillion, netting us a 214% increase in the stock price within just 365 days. This is genuinely unprecedented growth, most of which can be attributed to Nvidia's ventures in the AI market as the chipmaker's accelerators continue to fuel the hype train. Q2 24 earnings show that Nvidia's revenue rose by 141% QOQ, increasing to $10.3 billion in data centers, while gaming was a measly 11% at $2.5 billion. With virtually every company planning to get a piece of the AI pie, they still require chips specifically tailored for Artificial Intelligence training and inference. Nvidia's latest Blackwell-based B100 and B200 GPUs are reportedly sold out for the next 12 months. Companies revolving around AI, such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, you name it, are all in an arms race to procure the latest chips from Nvidia. AMD's CDNA3-based MI325X and the upcoming CDNA4-based MI355X could shake things up somewhat. For the time being, companies might still be inclined to prefer Nvidia due to its better software stack; however, more competition is good for evsuitablene - even multi-trillion-dollar conglomerates. The question boils down to mass-scale production since data centers and supercomputers require 10,000 to 100,000 GPUs, so it ultimately depends on whether either company can fulfill the required demand within the required time. These have been two very eventful years for not just Nvidia but its CEO, Jensen Huang, who is set to receive an honorary doctorate in engineering. Financially, consumer GPUs seem to be an afterthought for Nvidia, although leaks suggest that Nvidia is eying a January 2025 reveal for the much-anticipated RTX 50 series.

Sales of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+2.18%) blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy continue to soar, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The Danish pharma giant posted its third-quarter earnings report early Wednesday morning and boasted sales figures blowing past analysts’ projections. “We are pleased with the performance in the first nine months of 2024. The sales growth is driven by increasing demand for our GLP-1-based diabetes and obesity treatments, and we are serving more patients than ever before,” Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in a statement. Sales of the company’s weight loss drug Wegovy skyrocketed 79% to 17.3 billion Danish Krone ($2.5 billion) in the third-quarter of 2024, compared with in 9.6 billion Danish Krone ($1.37 billion) during the the same period last year. The drug beat analysts’ expectations of $2.3 billion, according to a consensus estimate from FactSet (FDS-0.97%) Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Wegovy belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications — made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+2.79%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have been having difficulty to get their hands on these treatments. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are both now working to increase their production of these meds and curb the sale of cheaper off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments. Eli Lilly reported its third-quarter earnings last week, but its blockbuster weight-loss drug failed to meet expectations. Sales of Zepbound, which launched last November, reached $1.2 billion in sales in the third-quarter of 2024, below analysts’ expectations of $1.7 billion, according to FactSet.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. AMD continues the theme with its second generation of 3D V-Cache to deliver unparalleled gaming performance and middling productivity. Thankfully, most gamers do not care about the benchmark-breaking number crunching as long as they get their framerate boosts, and the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers that sweet extra FPS. It's not a big enough jump to tempt those happy with a previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but anyone on Ryzen 5000 chips or jumping ship from Intel will love it if the $30 MSRP hike and AM5 overhauls don't sour the temptation. Crushes Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K in gaming with a cheaper cost Compatible with most AM5 CPU coolers without new adapters Around 8-22% of generational performance increases Upgrading from 5000X3D means all-new motherboards and DDR5 RAM $30 more expensive than its Ryzen 7 7800X3D predecessor 7800X3D users could wait for the next generation with bigger gains Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. I can tell you that extra cores and threads benefit raw productivity performance, but I'll always feel the temptation of a gaming-centric CPU that delivers boosted framerates, something AMD has repeatedly delivered with its -X3D chips. • Price and availability• CPU benchmarks• Gaming benchmarks• Competition• Should you buy? It's a simple fact that consistently proves itself with each processor generation: gamers want the best performance for their money and will take any desktop boosts as a convenient side effect. AMD has remained in the top-seller spot for most CPU retailers, with the previous-generation Ryzen 7 7800X3D sitting pretty as the gaming champion since its release. If that were ever to change, it'd be with a direct successor, and that's the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, here at last. While I've tested processors from both Intel and AMD, my personal PCs have always used AMD Ryzen chips for modern builds and even AMD Athlon 64 many years before that. I've watched them evolve and still choose them for myself. At its launch, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the only Zen 5 processor in AMD's Ryzen 9000X3D range. More variants, presumably (but so far unconfirmed) a 9900X3D and 9950X3D, are expected to follow. Price: $479 at Newegg Release: November 7, 2024 Cores: 8 Threads: 16 Base clock: 4.7GHz Max boost: Up to 5.2GHz L3 cache: 96MB Base TDP: 120W The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is an 8-core, 16-thread APU (SoC) running at a 120W base TDP like its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Its specs are also similar to AMD's Ryzen 7 9700X chip, which runs at a lower TDP with a reduced L3 cache, focused on productivity rather than gaming. Officially launching with a $479 MSRP, which is $30 more expensive than the $449 Ryzen 7 7800X3D it replaces, actual store listings come relatively close with some minor inflation. AMD has moved from a 4nm process to 5nm via TSMC's foundry but remains on the same AM5 socket with compatible 9000X3D motherboards and supports the same CPU coolers as its previous-gen Zen 4 (7000 Series) chips. Upgrading from a Ryzen 7000X3D chip would be a straightforward process for enthusiasts. Still, it wouldn't provide as much of a performance leap as it would for those using a Ryzen 7 5800X3D or similar AM4 variants using now-incompatible DDR4 memory modules (RAM) as AM5 requires DDR5. Having previously tested AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D and Ryzen 8000 Series processors like the Ryzen 5 8600G and Ryzen 7 8700G, I already had access to a compatible AM5-socket motherboard with the ASUS ROG STRIX B650-A Gaming WiFi. However, AMD provided all-new samples to ensure compatibility with the latest BIOS software and EXPO-compatible RAM running at 6000MHz. Arctic sent its Liquid Freezer III 360mm AIO to help test a separate processor, but it still offers the best cooling performance here. This review was made possible with review samples provided by G.SKILL, Samsung, and MSI via AMD alongside Arctic. The companies did not see the contents of the review before publishing. No matter what a processor was designed for, it always passes my usual gamut of synthetic benchmarks that test single-core and multi-core performance in various productivity tasks. As fun as it would be to skip right to the gaming tests, it's important to see where the Ryzen 7 9800X3D ranks among its peers in burst processing and longer, sustained stress tests. For burst processing tests in Geekbench 6, the 9800X3D scores above its lower-powered non-X3D sibling, the $359 Ryzen 7 9700X, in multi-core performance but below in single-core equivalents. In synthetic productivity benchmarks, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D performed around 21-22% faster than its predecessor, the 7800X3D. Of particular note is how far ahead Intel's $589 Core Ultra 9 285K pulls in multi-core tests, as by design, but there isn't much of a gap in the single-core category — remember this when I compare gaming performance next. Otherwise, there's about a 22% generational burst performance improvement over AMD's predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Sustained stress tests with Cinebench 2024 show a similar story, with the 9800X3D scoring slightly ahead of the Ryzen 7 9700X as before while creeping on the heels of Intel's $309 Core Ultra 5 245K. In the long run, single-core performance falls in favor of Intel, with more of a lead gained by the Core Ultra 9 285K as it once again places miles ahead in multi-core equivalents, dominating productivity by a colossal degree. Again, a 21% generational sustained performance over the 7800X3D matches the burst tests. In its official documentation for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, AMD touts an average 8% performance improvement in gaming compared to the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D. The amount depends on a range of engine-specific quirks that determine how CPU-bound or GPU-bound a title can be, though the percentage gap usually increases over time with post-launch driver updates. Nevertheless, the 7800X3D, until now, was the best gaming CPU available, so these improvements are no real surprise — so, it's far more interesting to compare the 9800X3D against Intel's top-end CPU: the Core Ultra 9 285K. While writing my Intel Core Ultra 9 285K review, no graphical setting changes would significantly increase my FPS in Forza Horizon 5. While it's likely a bug, this chart accurately represents the best framerate I can achieve at this time with the 'High' preset at 1080p. Matching estimations, Black Myth: Wukong scores almost identically on AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K, while the "121.9%" gains promised in the CPU-centric title Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation didn't manifest in my testing, sticking around 6% instead. While not much of a surprise given its excellent performance on practically any hardware, Forza Horizon 5 scores an outrageous average of 387 FPS, which is perfect for anyone who uses those 360Hz 1080p gaming monitors. However, something clearly is bugged on Intel's side, so I'm skipping the implied percentage gain for Forza. Moving from a disastrous launch to a patched-up marvel, Cyberpunk 2077 sees a 52% performance increase on the 9800X3D over Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K, proving far better of a pairing to NVIDIA's current high-end GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card. Far Cry 6 bumps up performance by 43% with the same GPU and DDR5-6000 RAM pairing, and the latest blockbuster Call of Duty entry enjoys a 41% lead as the 9800X3D earns extra frames in Black Ops 6. So, while I'm testing a tighter scope of popular AAA titles on PC, I still saw around a 36% performance increase in gaming with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Naturally, my number would be lower if I only tested games closer to the 100% to 110% range of AMD's generational game performance chart, but seeing visually-rich megahits like Call of Duty and Cyberpunk 2077 score such significant increases is reassuring for the performance of a brand-new processor at day one. Yes, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU you can buy, taking over from its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. 96MB of second-generation 3D V-Cache in the Zen 5 architecture helps push for higher FPS (frames per second) in games than Intel's top-end Core Ultra 9 285K, a rival processor that features more cores and threads, a higher clock speed, and slightly higher TDP. Ultimately, Intel's more expensive CPU offers better multi-core performance in productivity tasks and synthetic benchmarks, but AMD wins in gaming performance. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D has three significant competitors, though only two would be taken seriously by anyone on a budget. Internally, Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K stands against AMD's gaming CPU simply because it's the most powerful chip in the latest Core Ultra Series 200S range. However, this 24-core, 24-thread carries a price tag of around $589 to $630 and targets an entirely different audience who prioritizes energy efficiency within a productivity-centric software suite. Gaming performance on Intel's side remains relatively unchanged from its last-gen Core i9-14900K, which offered similar performance to its i9-13900K predecessor and suffered from an overarching microcode launch bug that was later fixed for the continued manufacturing of 14th Gen chips. Still, listings for the Core i9-14900K sit around $440 as AMD's Ryzen 9800X3D is ready to launch, making it an attractive option since some of its best motherboards support an established LGA 1700 socket with wide DDR4 and DDR5 RAM support, bringing down the overall cost of a custom build. The other major competitor is a call from inside Team Red's house, as the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D doesn't fall far enough behind the new 9800X3D to warrant an upgrade from anyone who already has one. On the other hand, those who already adopted the AM5 socket with all-new motherboards and DDR5 RAM could happily swap out their processor for this new replacement without buying any extra components, but dropping almost $500 on an 8-22% potential performance gain isn't so tempting. So, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D stands as a more logical upgrade path for those using a Ryzen 7 5800X3D from 2022. Still, this lumps users with the mandatory motherboard and RAM upgrades, though most AM4-compatible CPU coolers will work with AM5 replacements, so it's not entirely damaging to your budget. The bright side is that you'll feel a more significant boost if you upgrade from the 5800X3D, with compatibility for PCIe 5.0 (Gen 5), unlocking faster storage options with the CPU bump. Overall, it's a sticky situation because the only people who will see the most significant benefits are the ones doomed to spend extra cash on a total rig overhaul. ✅ You want the absolute best gaming CPU on the market. ✅ You crave the highest framerate count possible for high-FPS gameplay. ❌ You're already using a Ryzen 7 7800X3D or high-end 14th Gen Core i9. ❌ You rely on productivity apps that demand the best multi-core performance. Make no mistake: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU, politely dethroning its predecessor as the new king of the hill as a cache-heavy monster. However, it's not winning any awards for productivity. It isn't worth installing into a PC that spends most of its time crunching numbers in Microsoft Office and Teams since the 9900X and 9950X dominate that category, but it's a far better pick for gamers than anything from Intel's modern productivity-centric offerings. Unfortunately, those who'll benefit most will need to spend a sizeable amount of cash on a new motherboard and RAM upgrades, making the 9800X3D MSRP hike sting a little more than a cute $30. Nevertheless, this is the new meta for PC gaming, and nothing else can challenge its ability to deliver monstrous FPS counts if you can pair it with a capable GPU to enjoy the latest AAA titles loaded with visual luxuries. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is a hot pick for those willing to upgrade, taking over from the 7800X3D as the best gaming CPU and beating Intel's top offering.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) stands against the other fundamentally strong penny stocks. As per Royce Investment Partners, small caps saw a rebound in Q3, exhibiting a strong advance on both an absolute and relative basis. As per the investment management firm, the Russell 2000 Index saw an increase of ~9.3% in Q3 2024, surpassing the large-cap Russell 1000 Index (which rose ~6.1%) and the mega-cap Russell Top 50 Index (which increased ~4.2%). The investment firm believes that small caps see a long road back to the top, with large caps holding a commanding lead through the initial 9 months of 2024. On a YTD basis, the Russell 2000 saw an increase of ~11.2% compared to the respective gains of ~21.2% and ~27.3% for the Russell 1000 and Russell Top 50, in the third quarter of 2024. The investment firm said a confluence of factors might support small-caps in sustaining market leadership. The still-growing US economy, together with a more typical interest rate environment, might support small-cap leadership. As per Russell Investments, the US equity-market leadership reversed during Q3 2024, with small-cap stocks surpassing the returns delivered by their large-cap counterparts. Also, the value factor outperformed the growth factor. This means there was a significant pivot from the first 2 quarters of 2024, during which market returns were dominated by the US large-cap growth stocks— the Magnificent 7, to be precise. Russell Investments highlighted that, from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024, there was a moderate change in the US average daily turnover, with $578.8 billion in Q3 2024 as compared to $581.5 billion in Q2 2024. Q3 2024 saw a shift in investor focus from high-flying tech stocks to more traditional sectors. Small-cap and value stocks surpassed the performance of large-cap and growth stocks, thanks to the broader market rotation. Moreover, utility stocks saw significant traction due to higher investments in energy infrastructure in a bid to support the elevated demand from AI and data centers.

Wall Street experts believe that the shifts in monetary policy, sectoral innovation and developments, a favorable interest rate environment, and supportive regulatory environment are expected to fuel growth in small and emerging stocks over the next year. As per Francis Gannon, Co-Chief Investment Officer, and Managing Director of Royce Investment Partners, earnings form the foundation for long-term performance. This means that earnings tend to support the broader market over the long term. He noted that the Russell 2000 saw a near-record number of companies having no earnings, with a total of ~44.6% (as of September end). Despite this, the earnings growth for the small-cap companies that have them has been estimated to be higher than large-cap ones in 2025. Chuck Royce, Founder and Senior Advisor at Royce Investment Partners, believes that the lower rates are expected to help the M&A activity. The potential buyers have been waiting for the US Fed to act before they go ahead with acquisitions. He believes that many small-caps want to get merged. Therefore, there are expectations of more strategic buyouts moving forward. Our Methodology To list the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In, we used Finviz and Yahoo screeners to extract stocks trading under $5. Next, we selected the companies that have reliable 3-year revenue and 3-year net income growth rates. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings, as of Q2 2024.

Amazon is pushing ahead with its RTO policy When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Not long after hundreds of Amazon workers signed a petition against the company’s proposed five-day return-to-office policy, company CEO Andy Jassy has denied claims the mandate was introduced to quietly push workers away. At a recent all-hands meeting (via CNBC), Jassy rejected claims the RTO policy is a “backdoor layoff,” adding the push for in-person working would reinforce Amazon’s culture. The news comes after a September 2024 announcement detailing the new full-time RTO plans, set to be enacted from January 2, 2025. “A number of people I’ve seen theorize that the reason we were doing this is a backdoor layoff or we made some sort of deal with the city, or cities, and that’s why we were having people come back and be together more often," Jassy declared. The reaction from Amazon workers is understandable, given the company has laid off around 27,000 workers since tech redundancies skyrocketed in 2022. Signed by around 500 workers, the recent petition against the company’s RTO mandate alleged that AWS CEO Matt Garman’s claims many workers were on board with the change were incorrect. Prior to that, Garman also reportedly told workers unhappy with the change to consider leaving the company altogether. Up from the current three-day policy, the change to full-time office hours marks a significant shift in the tech sector. Many of Amazon’s rivals are still working on three-day mandates. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Just like Amazon, LGBTQ dating app Grindr recently faced criticism about its RTO policy. Although the specific details about its RTO policy are unconfirmed, workers alleged that they were given two weeks to relocate nearer to a hub. More than 80 were fired, many of whom citing accessibility concerns.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news. The AI Boom in Big Tech is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon. This past week, artificial intelligence was the key focus for the Big Five, which together are valued at more than $10 trillion. The reporting season not only highlighted the push these big tech companies are making in AI investments but also demonstrated that they aren’t afraid to take it up any further than they already have. Previously, concerns regarding the returns from substantial AI investments had led to negative investor sentiment and even triggered a sell-off in major AI plays. However, some results are demonstrating that AI investments may be worth the wait. READ ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4. “The AI theme is intact if you’re the mega caps,” as companies show that they can monetize their investments while maintaining existing profitability. As long as that infrastructure continues to be built, then we continue to be in a good place for the broader AI trade”. That said, executives of the major AI plays have fair-warned that their AI splurges will continue next year. Tech giants are racing to secure high-end chips and build sprawling data centers, forging partnerships with energy providers and much more. Each company wants to prove to Wall Street that these investments will eventually lead to greater profitability as compared to their current businesses. Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder at Constellation Research, believes that only a handful of technology names will be able to come out at the top, especially considering the high costs related to AI.

Wednesday, 06 Nov 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: Transport Minister Anthony Loke said he has no qualms if the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) investigates the sale of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) shares to a company linked to BlackRock. He said that the ministry, through the Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom), is only focused on regulating competition in the industry. "If the PAC chairman Datuk Mas Ermieyati Samsudi wants, she may call for a meeting any time to review the deal's details. "Mavcom only looks into industry dealings from a regulatory perspective ... (and) has no say in its equity distribution. "Eventhough Mavcom is under the ministry's purview, I am not directly involved in its decision making as meetings are attended by its own board members, and the decisions they make are independent and objective based on their mandate to regulate the industry," Loke told Parliament during his ministry's winding down speech of Budget 2025 on Wednesday (Nov 6). Loke was responding to concerns raised by Mohd Radzi Md Jidin (PN-Putrajaya) over the sale of MAHB's shares to a foreign company, with the latter demanding why MAHB shares could not have been sold to local investors. This comes after Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), along with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, planned to buy a 30% stake in MAHB's privatisation move. The deal was criticised by Opposition politicians after it emerged that GIP is in talks to be sold to BlackRock, a firm that is reported to have investments in Israel.

November 06, 2024 07:47 ET | Source: Thumzup Media Corporation Thumzup Media Corporation Los Angeles, CA, Nov. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Thumzup Media Corporation ("Thumzup" or the "Company") (Nasdaq: TZUP), a leading provider of innovative social media branding and marketing solutions which allow businesses and brands to pay customers and fans cash through Venmo and PayPal for their posts on social media, is nearing completion of developing video capabilities to facilitate its proprietary ad tech platform’s integration with Instagram Reels (Instagram and its trademark are owned by Meta Platforms, Inc.). Thumzup’s mobile app has thus far only enabled users to monetize single-photo posts on Instagram. To date, the platform has facilitated more than 23,000 single-photo posts on Instagram and has paid its creators approximately $230,000 through Venmo and PayPal. With the soon to be released addition of video capabilities, Thumzup is poised to unlock even greater earning potential for its users while also providing advertisers access to Instagram Reels’ powerful platform, so they can expand their reach to an even wider audience of social media users who want to get paid for their posts. “We believe Thumzup’s planned integration with Instagram Reels should significantly accelerate our growth. We have found that many of our advertisers prefer Instagram Reels due to its higher engagement rate. In fact, it is reported that Instagram Reels receive 22% more interaction than standard video posts, and this increased visibility can lead to more in-video purchases. Furthermore, many creators in our community of users have told us they are eager to get paid for posting videos on Instagram about participating advertisers’ products and services,” stated Thumzup Chief Executive Officer Robert Steele. “With an audience of over 726 million unique users, Instagram Reels’ audience is massive and highly engaged [1]. We expect Thumzup’s Instagram Reels integration to be transformative for our community of posters, our advertisers, and for our shareholders.” [1]: https://adamconnell.me/instagram-reels-statistics/ The Thumzup app is available for download on the App Store and Google Play.

Stock futures surge after the election win by former President Donald Trump, as did with bitcoin, Trump Media (DJT), Tesla (TSLA) and the Russell 2000. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as the firms that hold them, all made strong upward moves in early trading; Super Micro Computer (SMCI) declined as it provided uncertainty on filing its report and delivered weak revenue; Novo Nordisk (NVO) moved higher after reporting strong sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug; Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to make it the world’s most valuable company, overtaking iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are soaring after the presidential election victory for Republican Donald Trump, with premarket trading pushing Dow futures higher by about 3% and S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures up roughly 2%. Futures trading for the smaller-company focused Russell 2000 jumped by more than 6%. Shares of Trump Media (DJT) were up more than 30% and Tesla (TSLA) shares are up more than 12% in the premarket session. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 15 basis points to reach 4.45%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) surged to a record high, briefly topping $75,000, on the Trump victory. Bitcoin was recently around $74,586, up about 8% over the past 24 hours, while the estimated total value of the crypto market was higher by a similar percentage. Shares of several bitcoin-related companies, including trading app Robinhood (HOOD), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and Marathon Digital parent company MARA Holdings (MARA), surged 10% or more in premarket trading. Shares in Microstrategy (MSTR), a big holder of bitcoin, were 14% higher. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged premarket after the server maker said it couldn’t predict when it will file its delayed annual report for 2024. The company has been warned by Nasdaq about its requirements of “timely filing” of reports, giving it until Nov. 16 to issue its report or to submit a plan. The company reported preliminary quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ projections at $5.9 billion to $6 billion, down from the its previously guided range of $6 billion to $7 billion. Novo Nordisk (NVO) shares rose by about 3% premarket after the Danish drugmaker reported strong sales of its popular Wegovy weight-loss drug. Wegovy sales reached 17.3 billion Danish crowns, or $2.5 billion, in the third quarter, a jump of 48% from the prior quarter. For the nine-month period ended in September, the company reported a 21% increase in operating profit and a 31% increase in North American sales. Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued their climb in premarket trading, rising by a bit less than 1%, pushing its market capitalization to $3.43 trillion, higher than iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Apple’s shares edged higher in early trading, keeping its market capitalization at around $3.38 trillion. Nvidia had briefly overtaken Apple on Monday before moving higher again on Tuesday as demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips pushed the company’s share price higher. Microsoft (MSFT) is the only other company with a market cap above $3 trillion.

Shares of Trump Media (DJT) were up more than 30% and Tesla (TSLA) shares are up more than 12% in the premarket session. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 15 basis points to reach 4.45%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) surged to a record high, briefly topping $75,000, on the Trump victory. Bitcoin was recently around $74,586, up about 8% over the past 24 hours, while the estimated total value of the crypto market was higher by a similar percentage. Shares of several bitcoin-related companies, including trading app Robinhood (HOOD), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and Marathon Digital parent company MARA Holdings (MARA), surged 10% or more in premarket trading. Shares in Microstrategy (MSTR), a big holder of bitcoin, were 14% higher. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged premarket after the server maker said it couldn’t predict when it will file its delayed annual report for 2024. The company has been warned by Nasdaq about its requirements of “timely filing” of reports, giving it until Nov. 16 to issue its report or to submit a plan. The company reported preliminary quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ projections at $5.9 billion to $6 billion, down from the its previously guided range of $6 billion to $7 billion. Novo Nordisk (NVO) shares rose by about 3% premarket after the Danish drugmaker reported strong sales of its popular Wegovy weight-loss drug. Wegovy sales reached 17.3 billion Danish crowns, or $2.5 billion, in the third quarter, a jump of 48% from the prior quarter. For the nine-month period ended in September, the company reported a 21% increase in operating profit and a 31% increase in North American sales. Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued their climb in premarket trading, rising by a bit less than 1%, pushing its market capitalization to $3.43 trillion, higher than iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Apple’s shares edged higher in early trading, keeping its market capitalization at around $3.38 trillion. Nvidia had briefly overtaken Apple on Monday before moving higher again on Tuesday as demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips pushed the company’s share price higher. Microsoft (MSFT) is the only other company with a market cap above $3 trillion.

Title: Puttshack’s Technological Twist On Mini-Golf Hits 20 Locations

The view inside a Puttshack location Putt-putt, an amusement partaken by seven-to-seventy-year-olds may conjure memories of analog-fun—ramps leading into clown mouths and windmills with blades guarding the path to the hole that your opponent would have to spin to get turning. But to younger generations, a digitally enhanced version is fast becoming par for the course. Puttshack, a fast-growing eatertainment name, has just opened the doors on its 20th location in Dunwoody, Georgia, their second venue in the Atlanta GTA. The high-tech concept which received a $150 million capital infusion from BlackRock two years-ago, ditches miniature pencils and scorecards for their proprietary Trackaball technology, where the ball itself keeps tabs on players’ strokes and tabulates scores. “It knows the difference between you hitting the ball, and the ball hitting features on the course and so much to my children’s chagrin, you can’t actually cheat in the game so it does take some elements out of the traditional mini golf I remember as a kid,” CEO Logan Powell explained. Unlike traditional golf where were the lower your tally the better, scoring is via a modified Stableford system of sorts, with points awarded for birdies, pars and hole-in-ones, yet also subtracted for rolling into a hazard. There’s almost a pinball dynamic at play, with “supertube” markers on each hole that if hit, gush up point totals, setting the stage for plenty of lead changes within a round, which is by design. Powell views the dynamic scoring system through the prism of competitive socializing and wanted to facilitate as many opportunities to turn a round, well around, as possible. “We wanted to make sure that if you want to make a comeback, it levels the playing field a little bit and I can tell you from experience that I can go from crushing it one round and play the same course and just do horribly. Having those fun innovations, which also build on themselves—if you hit multiple super tubes in a row you get extra bonus points—the game encourages you to build up streaks and really go after it,” Powell adds, that often at the wire, it’s still anybody’s game. Holes feature skateboard style half pipes, a take on Connect Four, a tribute to beer pong and a basketball hole where a robot defender attempts to prevent balls from dunking.Its fair to say that their philosophy on hole design, is to keep the creative wheels turning. “We have a phenomenal innovation team based out of the U.K. who design all of our holes and we have new ones we’re developing now. We wanted to take the fun, nostalgic aspects of mini golf that you would think of from playing the traditional game but elevate it to target the demographic that tends to come to our stores—the 21-39 year old crowd,” Powell said, adding that they like elements to be recognizable but then to add a technology twist. Less than a year ago, they introduced the Challenge Hole, a private mini-golf suite where couples and small groups could eat-drink-play in a single location while playing a variety of putting themed games including a spin on Nintendo’s Duck Hunt, the point and shoot classic currently celebrating its 40th anniversary. “The ducks go across a screen and there are slots to put the the ball into and you’re trying to hit the ducks,” Powell explained, adding that reserving the Challenge Hole is popular for date nights. Addison, Texas is the beta test for the product and they plan to offer it as well in future locations, though a decision to retrofit existing locations to include one is still being considered. Puttshack’s main differentiating factor from other eatertainment concepts facilitating flatstick fun is how much it leans into technology. Though you find scorecards either at Puttery, which uses touchscreens to keep score or Tiger Woods’ Popstroke where an app is used to keep tallies and order food and drinks. The new Dunwoody location in Northern Atlanta, typifies the type of real estate sweet spots they scout for in order to hit their demographic trifecta—families, the corporate crowd and adults seeking an evening entertainment option. Domestically, locations average an ample 25,000 square feet and include dedicated private event space which get a lot of use over the holidays. “We typically target more urban locations, those hotspot areas within a market where you or your friends would think about going. When we think about a Puttshack location, it needs to be in an area where people tend to work, live, and play. We want to make sure we are in the consideration mix there,” Powell said. A group dining at a Puttshack location Beyond the mini-golf experience, the apps at Puttshack are as international as a Presidents Cup squad, offering shareables that range from Lebanese hummus and Korean bao buns to Thai fried chicken and Canadian-style poutine. Every location even has its own take on spring rolls—dubbed ‘tailpipes’—tailored to the local market. The Atlanta area locations feature fire-braised chicken, collard greens, and pimento cheese, served with BBQ and peach dipping sauces. Puttshack also gives back through its menu, with $1 of each tailpipe purchase supporting area charities. Their Boston location donates to the New England Center for Children, while the newly opened Dunwoody site supports Lost-n-Found, a local nonprofit that provides services to homeless LGBTQ+ youth. Powell expects the demand for experiential entertainment with friends, family and loved ones outside the home will continue to grow and welcomes new concepts pile into the space. “I think winners within the space will tend to have a technological competitive edge and that’s why we continue to innovate and make sure we have fresh ideas.” With only 20 units, Powell feels Puttshack is still merely scratching the surface in terms of expanding their footprint. On the near horizon, they have new stores in various stages of completion in the Minneapolis, Chicago and Fort Lauderdale areas and see plenty of opportunity to continue to expand in markets they already have a presence in, as they’ve done in Atlanta.

Title: Trump Media, Tesla, and crypto stocks surge as Trump wins — and clean energy companies tumble

Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election boosted shares of his social media company, Elon Musk's Tesla, as well as cryptocurrencies and related stocks on Wednesday. The former president's reelection sent renewable-energy stocks tumbling in premarket trading as traders bet his administration would be less friendly in terms of subsidies and regulation. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group surged as much as 62% to $55 as investors wagered Truth Social's parent company, which counts Trump as its largest shareholder, would benefit from his second term. The stock — which has Trump's initials, DJT, as its ticker — was trading 33% higher at last check. If the gain holds, Trump would be about $1.3 billion richer on paper given his near-53% stake in the company. Tesla stock rose as much as 15% in premarket trading and was poised to open at its highest level in more than a year. Musk, the electric-vehicle maker's CEO, has emerged as one of Trump's most vocal champions and closest advisors. If Tesla's overnight gain holds, Musk — already the world's richest person — would become $14 billion richer based on his roughly 13% stake. Bitcoin, the most popular crypto, climbed past $75,000 for the first time on election night before paring gains. Other digital coins including ethereum also jumped. Crypto stocks jumped on the prospect of a friendlier US regulatory environment under Trump. Coinbase and MicroStrategy both rose 13% ahead of the open. Conventional financial stocks also gained with Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Blackstone, and KKR rising between 6% and 9% in the US premarket. Traders expect Wall Street banks, asset managers, and private equity firms to benefit from tax cuts and deregulation under Trump. In contrast, clean-energy stocks slid with Plug Power, SunRun, First Solar, and Enphase Energy all dropping at least 10% in premarket trading. Danish wind turbine manufacturer Orsted and rival Vestas fell 10% and 8% respectively in Frankfurt trading. The declines likely reflect concerns that Trump's reelection will lead to the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by the Biden administration, which provided large-scale tax credits for renewable-energy providers. The broader stock market gained before the open with futures underlying the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing more than 2.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.8%.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures surged as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election over Kamala Harris. A call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the the Associated Press on Wednesday morning put him over the top, with Trump now set to have the distinction of being the 45th and the 47th US president. As of 6:00 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each soared around 1.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up around 2.9% on the heels of a winning day for stocks. Futures tied to the 10-year Treasury note (10Y=F), meanwhile, rose 16 basis points to trade around 4.4%. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rallied to a record alongside a surge in the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) as the evening's returns bolstered the "Trump trade." Outside of the presidential election, Republicans have also flipped the Senate. Control of the House of Representatives remains unclear. Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Earlier this week, Harris and Trump made their final pitches to voters. Trump pledged last-minute tariffs and less money for chips while Harris promised to "seek common ground" in her final rally in Philadelphia on Monday. American voters gave Donald Trump a commanding victory, powered in large part by an intense voter focus on inflation that has been evident for years. But Trump's key campaign promise of new tariffs and a “mass deportation” of undocumented immigrants could put new upward pressure on prices, the very issue that appears to have powered him to a win. A note from Capital Economics late Tuesday night crystallized some of the macroeconomic worries. The authors wrote that they expected Trump to push forward on his proposed immigration curbs and tariffs. They said that as a result, “We are minded to reduce our GDP growth forecast ... by roughly 1% and add 1% to our inflation forecast over the same period.” Read here for more about what Trump could mean on the key economic issue of price pressures, as well as taxes.= US stock futures surged as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election over Kamala Harris. A recent call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the Associated Press on Wednesday morning confirmed the victory. After a steady rally in stock futures overnight as Harris' path to victory narrowed, futures tied to the three major averages built on earlier jumps on the news. As of 6:00 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each soared around 1.6% and 2.3%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up around 2.9% on the heels of a winning day for stocks. Meanwhile, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 index (RTY=F) were up more than 6.5%. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) is pushing higher as investors bet on a faster pace of inflation under new Trump tariffs, and a slower pace of interest rate cuts from the Fed. “Overall though we think that a Trump win means higher inflation in the near-term versus the status quo with Harris, but slower growth (potentially shaving up to 0.5 percentage points off of GDP in 2025 and 2026). For FOMC policy, we think the Fed will continue to ease this year, but likely take a pause in the first half of 2025 as it waits to get a better sense of the impact of the new administration's policies on inflation and growth,” TD’s head of global strategy Rich Kelley said. The 10-year yield was up 14 basis points to around 4.26% early on Wednesday. For now, markets are taking this move in yields in stride. But keep in mind this is a market that loves prospects of more rate cuts. If that thesis gets pushed aside under Trump as tariffs spur new inflation, markets could recalibrate to the downside. Global stock markets had a mixed reaction to the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, as the Republican closed in on a second term in the White House. In China, stocks fell sharply on Wednesday, with Shanghai's blue-chip CSI 300 (000300.SS) closing 0.5% lower, and Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng (^HSI) down 2.3%. The Hang Seng China Enterprises (^HSCE) Index fell 2.6%. But Japan's tech-heavy Nikkei 225 (^N225) climbed 2.6%, while the broader Topix (0P00006NXB.T) stock index gained 1.9%. The rally came as the Japanese yen (JPY=X) sank to its lowest since July and the dollar (USD=X) strengthened. Europe's major stock gauges jumped in early trade. London's FTSE 100 (^FTSE) moved up 1.4%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) benchmark rose 1.6% as Frankfurt's DAX (^GDAXI) and Paris's CAC 40 (^FCHI) gained. Tesla (TSLA) shares are surging 13% in premarket trading as Donald Trump looks to be on the verge of winning the presidency again. A win could put Tesla CEO Elon Musk in pole position to shape the EV maker's future, given his strong backing of Trump — or at least, that is how Wall Street sees it early on. Says Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives in a note: For more on Tesla's roadmap under a potential Trump presidency, here is our chat on the topic on a recent episode of my Opening Bid podcast. Donald Trump took the stage in Palm Beach, Fl. in the early morning hours on Wednesday as he neared closer to securing the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidential election. "This is a movement like nobody’s ever seen before," he told the crowd in what sounded like a victory speech. "[This is] forever the day the American people regained control of their country." The Associated Press has not officially called the election. So far, Trump has secured 267 votes compared to Kamala Harris's 224. US stock futures soared as the results of the US presidential election all but confirmed a Donald Trump victory over Kamala Harris. The former president secured North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, three critical swing states, according to the Associated Press (AP). Results from Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Michigan remain unclear. Per the AP, Trump is just 3 electoral college votes short of clinching the win. As of 2:30 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each jumped around 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up over 2.0%. Republicans have won control of the Senate, the Associated Press projected early Wednesday. The GOP flipped a Democratic-held seat in West Virginia, as Republican Jim Justice won the open seat. In Ohio, meanwhile, Bernie Moreno unseated Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Democrats lost a key member of their coalition in the upper chamber (as my colleague Ben Werschkul detailed earlier in the blog). Seven seats hang in the balance, with Republicans looking for more gains. They are eyeing a pickup in Montana, where incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is trailing Republican challenger Tim Sheehy. Races in the key states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona remain too close to call. Democrats currently hold all those seats. Head over to the Yahoo News live blog for more election insights and updates. As US stock futures climbed late Tuesday, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RTY=F) were the star performer, rising as much as 3% to outpace their larger peers as investors bet on the likelihood that Donald Trump will win the presidential election. Companies within the index, which include regional banks and smaller domestic players, are expected to benefit from anticipated policies out of the Trump administration like lower taxes and cutting regulations. Tariffs that a Trump administration would also be expected to enact pushed the dollar higher overnight Tuesday, a benefit for small-cap companies that tend to be more levered to the domestic economy compared to more internationally oriented large-cap stocks. GOP challenger Bernie Moreno has defeated Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, according to the Associated Press. It’s a victory that almost surely means Republicans will take control of the Senate in 2025, but one that also has consequences for the crucial Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee. That committee, which Brown currently leads, has been the scene of closely watched hearings in recent years, with top CEOs like JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Jamie Dimon and Bank of America’s (BAC) Brian Moynihan forced to answer questions from lawmakers on a range of topics. Those hearings will surely continue in 2025 but now likely with a friendly lawmaker kicking off the questioning. The current GOP ranking member on that committee is Sen. Tim Scott. The South Carolinian has tended to be much friendlier to bank concerns, especially around banking regulations. It’s a handover that could have a keen impact on policy, especially if Donald Trump ends up winning back the White House. One top concern over the last year has been the proposed Basel III endgame requirements that would increase the reserve requirements on banks. Scott has often criticized the proposal, including leading a call on the Biden administration to withdraw it entirely. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices jumped to all-time highs late Tuesday as bets on Donald Trump accelerated in prediction markets. The former president has captured 198 electoral college votes compared to Kamala Harris's 112, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Bitcoin prices soared over 8% to trade around $74,200 a token — leaping past its previous record of around $73,750 a coin on March 14. Other crypto-adjacent names moved in tandem with bitcoin. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) moved over 4% higher in after-hours trading while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose over 3%. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies like dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and Ripple (XRP-USD) also jumped on the developments, rising 30% and 5%, respectively. Financial markets might be sniffing out a presidential win. One of the first big moves in markets on election night was a jump in the value of the US dollar (DX=F), which began strengthening around 7:45 p.m. ET. That occurred as the New York Times' prediction needle began to tilt slightly in Donald Trump’s direction, based on rising odds of Trump winning the swing states of Georgia and North Carolina. Other forecasts suggest a similar Trump edge. Here's the logic for a stronger dollar: Trump wants to impose new tariffs on more than $3 trillion worth of imports, which would push up prices and make inflation higher than it would otherwise be. Higher inflation generally means higher interest rates, and higher rates would draw more global investments to US securities because of the higher return. More demand for US assets boosts demand for the dollar, making it more valuable relative to other currencies. Still, this is an early move and does not mean Trump is destined for victory, though Harris is now unlikely to win in a landslide. Key swing states, including the "blue wall" of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, in addition to North Carolina and Georgia, had not yet been called as of 10:25 p.m. ET. The Trump trade is rallying, with the US dollar (DX=F), bitcoin (BTC-USD), and equity futures all pushing higher as Trump secured 178 electoral college votes compared to Harris's 99, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Decision Desk HQ, a private company that projects election results, projected Trump to also win North Carolina, a key swing state. Bitcoin prices extended gains by over 7% to trade above $72,800, while the US dollar rose to its highest level since July. Against other currencies like the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso, the US dollar is up over 1%. Near 9:40 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose about 1.1%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) also jumped over 1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 1.2%. Political betting markets made a limited move toward Donald Trump early in what is expected to be a long election night. As of 9:15 p.m. ET, the odds on Kalshi.com, a political prediction market open to US citizens, stood at 68% in Trump’s favor, projecting he would win about 2 out of 3 hypothetical contests. The odds were similar on Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market, sitting at 72.4% at 9:15 p.m. ET. It was a noticeable — but far from definite — jump on both sites from the odds earlier in the night before the polls closed when both markets showed Trump's odd about 10 percentage points lower. The surge in these markets was most evident a bit after 7:30 p.m. ET. Gains for Trump noticeably leveled off and largely held steady throughout the 8 p.m. hour. Both sites are continuing to accept bets throughout the night, with Kalshi touting that their main market now has over $280 million at stake. Citi analysts detailed “election trades to track," and YF's Rick Newman highlighted seven of them: solar energy, fossil fuels, deregulation, tariffs, inflation, antitrust, and housing. A reminder that while stocks don't care who the president is, and mostly like certainty, the election results will have implications across industries. Read more here. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose 3% in after-hours trading as election results continued to pour in Tuesday night. More results are expected to be announced in the coming hours. Tech billionaire Musk, who serves as the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX and also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has been outspoken about his support of Trump ahead of the election. Trump has even said he would consider a Cabinet position for Musk but that the businessman likely would not be able to serve "with all the things he's got going on." Intelligent Alpha CEO and founder Doug Clinton told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination on Tuesday that "it will be a very interesting night for Elon Musk." "He's obviously made a really big bet on the election going one direction," said Clinton, who is also managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. "I think if it goes against him — if Kamala Harris is elected president — I think it probably is a negative for him." It's possible Tesla could still benefit from a Harris presidency, given she could provide further tax incentives for electric vehicles as part of a continuation of Biden's green energy push. As a result, if Trump loses, Musk could likely "find some way to try to mend fences," Clinton said. "Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world," he said. Tesla shares are up about 1% since the start of the year. The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump could come down to coin-flip odds and may not be known for hours (if not days). But that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of results that could sway markets. Everything from which party will lead key congressional committees to the sway that certain industries like cryptocurrencies will have in Washington, D.C., are also on the ballot. Curious what races Jamie Dimon and crypto executives will be watching most closely? Read on here. A lot of folks on the Street I have chatted up this week are bracing for a big move in markets Wednesday morning, as the belief is that the winner of the election will be known later on tonight. Moreover, either winner would be seen as a surprise for markets (weird how these things are viewed by investors). Take that with a grain of salt, as such groupthink could mean we don't get a big move in markets on Wednesday. Amid the action, I would keep a close eye on bond yields, as markets could very well take their direction from them, based on my conversations. It's a point the Goldman Sachs team made today in a note making the rounds this evening: "The upcoming US elections could drive further upward pressure on global bond yields and indigestion for equities," said Goldman Sachs strategist Andrea Ferrario. Ferrario added, "Rising bond yields might eventually become a speed limit for equities if real yields start to increase (vs. real GDP growth expectations) or if increases in bond yields are too rapid." Futures moved firmly into green figures on Tuesday evening as early results from the US presidential election rolled in while cryptocurrencies surged and the US dollar also gained. Near 8 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) moved roughly 0.5% higher. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 0.7%. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) was also up as much as 4.5% to trade north of $71,000. The dollar was also stronger against most major currency pairs, including the yen and euro. So far, Trump has won Kentucky, West Virginia, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Florida, Tennessee, and Indiana, while Harris has claimed Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, according to the Associated Press. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged more than 20% in after-hours trading on Tuesday as early votes showed Trump clinch Kentucky and Indiana. The stock had a wild session during market hours after trading was halted several times due to volatility. Shares somewhat recovered from steeper losses but still closed down a little over 1%. Shortly after the market close, DJT reported third quarter results that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. The company also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Read more here.

US stock futures surged as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election over Kamala Harris. A call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the the Associated Press on Wednesday morning put him over the top, with Trump now set to have the distinction of being the 45th and the 47th US president. As of 6:00 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each soared around 1.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up around 2.9% on the heels of a winning day for stocks. Futures tied to the 10-year Treasury note (10Y=F), meanwhile, rose 16 basis points to trade around 4.4%. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rallied to a record alongside a surge in the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) as the evening's returns bolstered the "Trump trade." Outside of the presidential election, Republicans have also flipped the Senate. Control of the House of Representatives remains unclear. Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Earlier this week, Harris and Trump made their final pitches to voters. Trump pledged last-minute tariffs and less money for chips while Harris promised to "seek common ground" in her final rally in Philadelphia on Monday. American voters gave Donald Trump a commanding victory, powered in large part by an intense voter focus on inflation that has been evident for years. But Trump's key campaign promise of new tariffs and a “mass deportation” of undocumented immigrants could put new upward pressure on prices, the very issue that appears to have powered him to a win. A note from Capital Economics late Tuesday night crystallized some of the macroeconomic worries. The authors wrote that they expected Trump to push forward on his proposed immigration curbs and tariffs. They said that as a result, “We are minded to reduce our GDP growth forecast ... by roughly 1% and add 1% to our inflation forecast over the same period.” Read here for more about what Trump could mean on the key economic issue of price pressures, as well as taxes.= US stock futures surged as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election over Kamala Harris. A recent call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the Associated Press on Wednesday morning confirmed the victory. After a steady rally in stock futures overnight as Harris' path to victory narrowed, futures tied to the three major averages built on earlier jumps on the news. As of 6:00 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each soared around 1.6% and 2.3%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up around 2.9% on the heels of a winning day for stocks. Meanwhile, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 index (RTY=F) were up more than 6.5%. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) is pushing higher as investors bet on a faster pace of inflation under new Trump tariffs, and a slower pace of interest rate cuts from the Fed. “Overall though we think that a Trump win means higher inflation in the near-term versus the status quo with Harris, but slower growth (potentially shaving up to 0.5 percentage points off of GDP in 2025 and 2026). For FOMC policy, we think the Fed will continue to ease this year, but likely take a pause in the first half of 2025 as it waits to get a better sense of the impact of the new administration's policies on inflation and growth,” TD’s head of global strategy Rich Kelley said. The 10-year yield was up 14 basis points to around 4.26% early on Wednesday. For now, markets are taking this move in yields in stride. But keep in mind this is a market that loves prospects of more rate cuts. If that thesis gets pushed aside under Trump as tariffs spur new inflation, markets could recalibrate to the downside. Global stock markets had a mixed reaction to the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, as the Republican closed in on a second term in the White House. In China, stocks fell sharply on Wednesday, with Shanghai's blue-chip CSI 300 (000300.SS) closing 0.5% lower, and Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng (^HSI) down 2.3%. The Hang Seng China Enterprises (^HSCE) Index fell 2.6%. But Japan's tech-heavy Nikkei 225 (^N225) climbed 2.6%, while the broader Topix (0P00006NXB.T) stock index gained 1.9%. The rally came as the Japanese yen (JPY=X) sank to its lowest since July and the dollar (USD=X) strengthened. Europe's major stock gauges jumped in early trade. London's FTSE 100 (^FTSE) moved up 1.4%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) benchmark rose 1.6% as Frankfurt's DAX (^GDAXI) and Paris's CAC 40 (^FCHI) gained. Tesla (TSLA) shares are surging 13% in premarket trading as Donald Trump looks to be on the verge of winning the presidency again. A win could put Tesla CEO Elon Musk in pole position to shape the EV maker's future, given his strong backing of Trump — or at least, that is how Wall Street sees it early on. Says Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives in a note: For more on Tesla's roadmap under a potential Trump presidency, here is our chat on the topic on a recent episode of my Opening Bid podcast. Donald Trump took the stage in Palm Beach, Fl. in the early morning hours on Wednesday as he neared closer to securing the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidential election. "This is a movement like nobody’s ever seen before," he told the crowd in what sounded like a victory speech. "[This is] forever the day the American people regained control of their country." The Associated Press has not officially called the election. So far, Trump has secured 267 votes compared to Kamala Harris's 224. US stock futures soared as the results of the US presidential election all but confirmed a Donald Trump victory over Kamala Harris. The former president secured North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, three critical swing states, according to the Associated Press (AP). Results from Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Michigan remain unclear. Per the AP, Trump is just 3 electoral college votes short of clinching the win. As of 2:30 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each jumped around 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up over 2.0%. Republicans have won control of the Senate, the Associated Press projected early Wednesday. The GOP flipped a Democratic-held seat in West Virginia, as Republican Jim Justice won the open seat. In Ohio, meanwhile, Bernie Moreno unseated Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Democrats lost a key member of their coalition in the upper chamber (as my colleague Ben Werschkul detailed earlier in the blog). Seven seats hang in the balance, with Republicans looking for more gains. They are eyeing a pickup in Montana, where incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is trailing Republican challenger Tim Sheehy. Races in the key states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona remain too close to call. Democrats currently hold all those seats. Head over to the Yahoo News live blog for more election insights and updates. As US stock futures climbed late Tuesday, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RTY=F) were the star performer, rising as much as 3% to outpace their larger peers as investors bet on the likelihood that Donald Trump will win the presidential election. Companies within the index, which include regional banks and smaller domestic players, are expected to benefit from anticipated policies out of the Trump administration like lower taxes and cutting regulations. Tariffs that a Trump administration would also be expected to enact pushed the dollar higher overnight Tuesday, a benefit for small-cap companies that tend to be more levered to the domestic economy compared to more internationally oriented large-cap stocks. GOP challenger Bernie Moreno has defeated Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, according to the Associated Press. It’s a victory that almost surely means Republicans will take control of the Senate in 2025, but one that also has consequences for the crucial Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee. That committee, which Brown currently leads, has been the scene of closely watched hearings in recent years, with top CEOs like JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Jamie Dimon and Bank of America’s (BAC) Brian Moynihan forced to answer questions from lawmakers on a range of topics. Those hearings will surely continue in 2025 but now likely with a friendly lawmaker kicking off the questioning. The current GOP ranking member on that committee is Sen. Tim Scott. The South Carolinian has tended to be much friendlier to bank concerns, especially around banking regulations. It’s a handover that could have a keen impact on policy, especially if Donald Trump ends up winning back the White House. One top concern over the last year has been the proposed Basel III endgame requirements that would increase the reserve requirements on banks. Scott has often criticized the proposal, including leading a call on the Biden administration to withdraw it entirely. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices jumped to all-time highs late Tuesday as bets on Donald Trump accelerated in prediction markets. The former president has captured 198 electoral college votes compared to Kamala Harris's 112, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Bitcoin prices soared over 8% to trade around $74,200 a token — leaping past its previous record of around $73,750 a coin on March 14. Other crypto-adjacent names moved in tandem with bitcoin. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) moved over 4% higher in after-hours trading while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose over 3%. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies like dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and Ripple (XRP-USD) also jumped on the developments, rising 30% and 5%, respectively. Financial markets might be sniffing out a presidential win. One of the first big moves in markets on election night was a jump in the value of the US dollar (DX=F), which began strengthening around 7:45 p.m. ET. That occurred as the New York Times' prediction needle began to tilt slightly in Donald Trump’s direction, based on rising odds of Trump winning the swing states of Georgia and North Carolina. Other forecasts suggest a similar Trump edge. Here's the logic for a stronger dollar: Trump wants to impose new tariffs on more than $3 trillion worth of imports, which would push up prices and make inflation higher than it would otherwise be. Higher inflation generally means higher interest rates, and higher rates would draw more global investments to US securities because of the higher return. More demand for US assets boosts demand for the dollar, making it more valuable relative to other currencies. Still, this is an early move and does not mean Trump is destined for victory, though Harris is now unlikely to win in a landslide. Key swing states, including the "blue wall" of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, in addition to North Carolina and Georgia, had not yet been called as of 10:25 p.m. ET. The Trump trade is rallying, with the US dollar (DX=F), bitcoin (BTC-USD), and equity futures all pushing higher as Trump secured 178 electoral college votes compared to Harris's 99, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Decision Desk HQ, a private company that projects election results, projected Trump to also win North Carolina, a key swing state. Bitcoin prices extended gains by over 7% to trade above $72,800, while the US dollar rose to its highest level since July. Against other currencies like the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso, the US dollar is up over 1%. Near 9:40 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose about 1.1%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) also jumped over 1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 1.2%. Political betting markets made a limited move toward Donald Trump early in what is expected to be a long election night. As of 9:15 p.m. ET, the odds on Kalshi.com, a political prediction market open to US citizens, stood at 68% in Trump’s favor, projecting he would win about 2 out of 3 hypothetical contests. The odds were similar on Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market, sitting at 72.4% at 9:15 p.m. ET. It was a noticeable — but far from definite — jump on both sites from the odds earlier in the night before the polls closed when both markets showed Trump's odd about 10 percentage points lower. The surge in these markets was most evident a bit after 7:30 p.m. ET. Gains for Trump noticeably leveled off and largely held steady throughout the 8 p.m. hour. Both sites are continuing to accept bets throughout the night, with Kalshi touting that their main market now has over $280 million at stake. Citi analysts detailed “election trades to track," and YF's Rick Newman highlighted seven of them: solar energy, fossil fuels, deregulation, tariffs, inflation, antitrust, and housing. A reminder that while stocks don't care who the president is, and mostly like certainty, the election results will have implications across industries. Read more here. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose 3% in after-hours trading as election results continued to pour in Tuesday night. More results are expected to be announced in the coming hours. Tech billionaire Musk, who serves as the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX and also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has been outspoken about his support of Trump ahead of the election. Trump has even said he would consider a Cabinet position for Musk but that the businessman likely would not be able to serve "with all the things he's got going on." Intelligent Alpha CEO and founder Doug Clinton told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination on Tuesday that "it will be a very interesting night for Elon Musk." "He's obviously made a really big bet on the election going one direction," said Clinton, who is also managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. "I think if it goes against him — if Kamala Harris is elected president — I think it probably is a negative for him." It's possible Tesla could still benefit from a Harris presidency, given she could provide further tax incentives for electric vehicles as part of a continuation of Biden's green energy push. As a result, if Trump loses, Musk could likely "find some way to try to mend fences," Clinton said. "Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world," he said. Tesla shares are up about 1% since the start of the year. The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump could come down to coin-flip odds and may not be known for hours (if not days). But that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of results that could sway markets. Everything from which party will lead key congressional committees to the sway that certain industries like cryptocurrencies will have in Washington, D.C., are also on the ballot. Curious what races Jamie Dimon and crypto executives will be watching most closely? Read on here. A lot of folks on the Street I have chatted up this week are bracing for a big move in markets Wednesday morning, as the belief is that the winner of the election will be known later on tonight. Moreover, either winner would be seen as a surprise for markets (weird how these things are viewed by investors). Take that with a grain of salt, as such groupthink could mean we don't get a big move in markets on Wednesday. Amid the action, I would keep a close eye on bond yields, as markets could very well take their direction from them, based on my conversations. It's a point the Goldman Sachs team made today in a note making the rounds this evening: "The upcoming US elections could drive further upward pressure on global bond yields and indigestion for equities," said Goldman Sachs strategist Andrea Ferrario. Ferrario added, "Rising bond yields might eventually become a speed limit for equities if real yields start to increase (vs. real GDP growth expectations) or if increases in bond yields are too rapid." Futures moved firmly into green figures on Tuesday evening as early results from the US presidential election rolled in while cryptocurrencies surged and the US dollar also gained. Near 8 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) moved roughly 0.5% higher. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 0.7%. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) was also up as much as 4.5% to trade north of $71,000. The dollar was also stronger against most major currency pairs, including the yen and euro. So far, Trump has won Kentucky, West Virginia, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Florida, Tennessee, and Indiana, while Harris has claimed Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, according to the Associated Press. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged more than 20% in after-hours trading on Tuesday as early votes showed Trump clinch Kentucky and Indiana. The stock had a wild session during market hours after trading was halted several times due to volatility. Shares somewhat recovered from steeper losses but still closed down a little over 1%. Shortly after the market close, DJT reported third quarter results that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. The company also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Read more here.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Record as Pro-Crypto Trump Heads Toward US Victory

(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin jumped to a record high, part of a wave of trades across global markets in response to Donald Trump emerging victorious over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow The largest digital asset rose as much as 10% to $76,106 with Trump winning a second term, the Republicans taking back the Senate and the House looking increasingly more likely to remain red. The increase was the most since the last peak in March, when investors were cheered by inflows into US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin is viewed by many as a so-called Trump trade because the former president embraced digital assets during his campaign after a major push by the industry. Crypto muscled onto the high table of politics by deploying a giant campaign-finance war chest to further its agenda. Trump vowed to make the US the crypto capital of the planet, create a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appoint regulators who love digital assets. Harris adopted a more measured approach, pledging to support a regulatory framework for the industry. In contrast, the Securities & Exchange Commission under the Biden administration pursued a crackdown via a flurry of enforcement actions. “The crypto industry feels like it’s been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years, and it senses that might be coming to an end,” said Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management Inc. “People are starting to position for the next few years in crypto.” In Ohio, Republican car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno beat Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown. Crypto titans spent some $40 million to defeat Brown — a longtime skeptic of the industry — underlining the influence of their political outlays. The prospect of friendlier US crypto rules led to gains across the digital-asset market. Second-ranked token Ether added about 12%. Dogecoin, a meme-crowd favorite promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk, rallied 31% at one point. Gensler’s Fate Digital-asset companies often complained that officials under President Joe Biden failed to create a clear new legal framework for the nascent market. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said existing rules apply and repeatedly labeled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency cracked down on crypto following a 2022 market rout that triggered a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange. “The first test of his credibility to watch out for is whether he will deliver on his promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market making firm Auros. Bitcoin has now advanced more than 80% in 2024, topping assets such as stocks and gold. US spot-Bitcoin ETFs, from issuers such as BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, have attracted $23.5 billion of net inflows following their launch at the start of the year — among the most successful new ETFs in history. --With assistance from Teresa Xie and Dave Liedtka.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged as much as 25% before paring gains in after-hours trading on Tuesday as investors brace for more wild swings with Donald Trump edging ahead of Kamala Harris in the latest election results. All states have now closed their respective polling stations. So far, Trump has secured 248 electoral college votes, while Harris has claimed 214, according to the Associated Press. The stock had a wild session during market hours on Tuesday as trading was halted several times due to volatility, with shares quickly erasing 15% gains and reversing Monday's double-digit percentage rise to kick off the week. Despite a recovery from steeper losses, shares still closed down a little over 1%. The latest price action comes as investors await the results of the presidential election between the Republican nominee and his challenger. Volatility in the stock is expected to continue as strategists categorize the stock as a binary bet on the election. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of investment fund Tuttle Capital Management, recently told Yahoo Finance's Catalysts that the trajectory of shares hinges on "a buy the rumor, sell the fact" trading strategy. Read more: Trump vs. Harris: 4 ways the next president could impact your bank accounts "I would imagine that the day after him winning, you'd see this come down," he surmised. "If he loses, I think it goes to zero." Interactive Brokers' chief strategist Steve Sosnick said DJT has taken on a meme-stock "life of its own." "It was volatile on the way up, and when a stock is that volatile in one direction, it has a tendency to be that volatile in the other direction," he said on a call with Yahoo Finance last week. In September, shares in the company — the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform, Truth Social — traded at its lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. Shares had bounced back from their lows, though, as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus. As Truth Social attempts to take on social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question. On Tuesday, DJT dropped third quarter results after the market close that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. This was narrower than the $26.03 million the company reported in the year-ago period. DJT also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Over the past nine months ending Sept. 30, revenue has fallen 23% from the prior-year period. Last month, the company revealed that its COO had stepped down in September. Trump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT, making his share worth billions. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Title: Bitcoin – Volatility reigns as election uncertainty spurs $541M in BTC ETF outflows

Could the inflows into BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF indicate a broader shift in investor sentiment towards Bitcoin ETFs? With the U.S Presidential election around the corner, the crypto market has seen a surge in volatility. Bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in particular, have felt the impact, with notable outflows observed on 1st and 4th November. With Election Day now here, uncertainty surrounding potential political shifts is continuing to add to the ups and downs of the Bitcoin ETF landscape. According to the latest data from Farside Investors on 4 November, Bitcoin ETFs recorded significant outflows – Totaling $541.1 million. Fidelity’s FBTC led the trend, with outflows hitting $169.6 million, followed closely by Ark 21Shares’ ARKB which saw $138.3 million in outflows. Grayscale’s BTC and Bitwise’s BITB also faced declines, with outflows of $89.5 million and $79.8 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $63.7 million outflows too. Although most ETFs reported outflows, Invesco’s BTCO and WisdomTree’s BTCW stood out by maintaining stable flows without any outflows. Despite the broader downturn, however, not all updates were negative. BlackRock’s IBIT notably bucked the trend by attracting $38.4 million in inflows. Reflecting this optimism within the crypto community, Dr. Dinero shared a positive perspective, highlighting hopeful sentiment despite recent market turbulence. Source: Dr. Dinero/X Another X user noted, Source: Flip/X Looking at the cumulative data though, BTC ETFs have generated significant inflows since their launch, with volumes of $23 billion. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT alone recorded $26 billion in inflows. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF analyst, had previously forecasted that BTC ETFs might soon exceed the holdings attributed to Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It was expected that these ETFs will reach this milestone by mid-December. However, a recent single-day purchase by BlackRock, totaling 12,127 BTC, has accelerated this timeline. In response to this significant accumulation, Balchunas shared his insights on X. He highlighted the swift momentum ETFs have gained in Bitcoin’s space. “At this rate, they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks. Altho they can’t keep up this Joey Chestnut-level pace, can they?” This recent surge in Bitcoin ETF activity has coincided with notable price volatility in BTC itself. After touching $73,000 just days ago, Bitcoin has now dipped below the $70,000-threshold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $68,807.31, following a slight 0.10% drop over the last 24 hours. On the weekly charts, it fell by over 3%. Thus, as election season adds an extra layer of uncertainty, the crypto market might be gearing up for further volatility in the coming days.

Click to read more Swiggy, the Indian food delivery giant, recently raised $605 million by selling shares to institutional investors, including well-known names like Fidelity and Norges Bank. This funding move marks a significant step as Swiggy prepares for a $1.35 billion initial public offering (IPO), expected to be India’s second-largest IPO this year. The share sale reflects strong institutional interest in Swiggy’s stock, underscoring confidence in the company’s growth potential and market position. In addition to Fidelity and Norges, domestic mutual funds have also shown keen interest in Swiggy’s offering, collectively purchasing shares worth $246 million, as noted in a stock exchange filing by Swiggy. This local support from mutual funds further strengthens Swiggy’s financial backing as it moves toward its IPO, which has generated widespread anticipation in India’s financial markets.

Swiggy’s innovation DNA is key to success and it could again be at the forefront through its new 10-minute food delivery offering.

At the upper price band of ₹390, the issue is priced at 7.8x FY24 Market Cap to Sales and looks reasonably priced compared to Zomato which is trading at 17.5x.” Swiggy plans to utilise the IPO proceeds towards funding investment in the Material Subsidiary, Scootsy, investment in technology and cloud infrastructure, brand marketing and business promotion expenses for enhancing the brand awareness and visibility of its platform, across segments; and for funding inorganic growth through unidentified acquisitions and general corporate purposes.

This funding move marks a significant step as Swiggy prepares for a $1.35 billion initial public offering (IPO), expected to be India’s second-largest IPO this year. The share sale reflects strong institutional interest in Swiggy’s stock, underscoring confidence in the company’s growth potential and market position. In addition to Fidelity and Norges, domestic mutual funds have also shown keen interest in Swiggy’s offering, collectively purchasing shares worth $246 million, as noted in a stock exchange filing by Swiggy. This local support from mutual funds further strengthens Swiggy’s financial backing as it moves toward its IPO, which has generated widespread anticipation in India’s financial markets. Swiggy Limited has emerged as a key player in India’s burgeoning on-demand delivery landscape. Its user-friendly app connects millions with a diverse range of services, extending far beyond food delivery to encompass groceries and logistics. Focused on innovation and convenience, Swiggy has solidified its presence, particularly in urban centres across the nation. This IPO will feature a total issue size of ₹11,327.43 crores, comprising a fresh issue of ₹4,499 crores and an offer for sale of ₹6,828.43 crores, inviting investors to partake in its growth story. Inputs from PTI report “At the upper price band of ₹390, Swiggy is available at Mcap/sales of 7.8x (on FY24 financials), which appears to be fairly priced. We assign a “Subscribe” rating for the issue on a long term investment basis, considering its strong brand recall, diversified offerings, integrated app, rapid scaling, consistent innovation, expansion of dark stores, and promising industry outlook.” QIB - NIL NII - NIL RIIs 0- 0.04 times Employee Reserved - 0.02 times Total: 0.01 times Indications from the grey market point to a muted listing-day gain for Swiggy. Combined with its rich valuation, this could make retail investors wary — similar to how they reacted to Hyundai Motor India’s recent debut. Still, foreign investors are likely to be big buyers, given their optimism about India’s long-term consumption growth, even if Swiggy’s shares don’t come cheap. Bloomberg report Track bl’s stock market live updates here Screenshot 2024-11-06 095124.png “Swiggy operates in a oligopoly market which is at a nascent stage, thus providing enough opportunities for players to create their niche. Swiggy’s innovation DNA is key to success and it could again be at the forefront through its new 10-minute food delivery offering. However, given that the company is still loss making at an aggregate level, and overall profitability may be some time away, we recommend only High Risk investors to ‘Subscribe for long term’. At the upper price band of ₹390, the issue is priced at 7.8x FY24 Market Cap to Sales and looks reasonably priced compared to Zomato which is trading at 17.5x.” Swiggy plans to utilise the IPO proceeds towards funding investment in the Material Subsidiary, Scootsy, investment in technology and cloud infrastructure, brand marketing and business promotion expenses for enhancing the brand awareness and visibility of its platform, across segments; and for funding inorganic growth through unidentified acquisitions and general corporate purposes.

Title: Should You Pick META Stock At $560?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/11/05/should-you-pick-meta-stock-at-560/
Time Published: 2024-11-06T04:00:01Z
Full Content:
AUSTIN, TEXAS - SEPTEMBER 18: In this photo illustration, the Instagram logo is displayed on a ... [+] computer screen on September 18, 2024 in Austin, Texas. (Photo illustration by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) has seen a 3% fall in a week, while it’s up around 60% this year. The company recently reported its Q3 results, which were better than the street estimates. Its top line stood at $40.6 billion and the bottom line at $6.03, compared to the consensus estimates of $40.2 billion and $5.25, respectively. Despite a beat, the stock didn’t see any gains, as investors were concerned about higher costs. Let’s dive deeper into the company’s quarterly performance and its impact on META stock. Also, look at what’s happening with Google stock. Meta Platforms’ revenues of $40.6 billion in Q3 reflected a 19% y-o-y rise, driven by a 7% rise in ad impressions and an 11% growth in average price per ad. Meta also reported a 5% rise in family daily active people to 3.29 billion. Most of the company’s revenue came from ad sales on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company is benefiting from its AI push, targeting more advertising. The company plans to use AI to generate more content. Not only did the company post higher revenues, its operating margin expanded to 43%, up around 300 bps y-o-y. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in earnings of $6.03 per share, up 37% y-o-y. Looking forward, Meta expects its Q4 revenue to be in the range of $45 billion to $48 billion. What didn’t sit well with the investors was the company’s hike in capital spending guidance to $38 billion to $40 billion and higher investments in 2025 as well. This compares with $27 billion Meta spent in capital expenditures in 2023. Much of the new investments are related to the company’s AI push involving data centers and related infrastructure. META stock, with 60% gains this year, has outperformed some of the other large tech stocks, including GOOG, up 21%, AMZN, up 28%, and MSFT, up 9%. However, we think META stock is appropriately priced now. We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation to be $560 per share, aligning with its current levels. At $560, META stock is already trading at 25x expected earnings of $22.65 in 2024, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 17x over the last three years. A rise in valuation multiple for META makes sense given the solid advertising growth lately. However, continued aggressive investments into AI also poses a slight risk if it would eventually provide a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings growth. For now, the story for most of the tech stocks is about valuation multiples. Some of them are trading at levels higher than seen over recent years. Although META stock has seen a 2x rise since 2021, the increase has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 194% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While META stock looks appropriately priced, it is helpful to see how Meta’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

The world's largest crypto rose to $74,504 on the day, beating its previous March all-time high of $73,780, CoinGecko data shows. Bitcoin is now up more than 9% over the last 24 hours. It has more than doubled in price in the last 12 months. It comes amid the U.S. election results between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, with the former gaining an early lead in electoral college votes. Trump or Harris need 270 electoral college votes to secure the presidency. Trump leads with 198 to Harris' 99, according to the latest figures from the Associated Press. Analysts have been citing a "Trump trade" is in play, which, they say, has helped bolster risk assets, including equities and crypto. The business mogul and former reality TV star has explicitly said he will help the digital asset industry, while Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has been quieter on the issue. Trump's renewed shot at claiming a second term in the White House has been keenly felt around the crypto industry, according to VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel. "Trump has made material inroads in the last month," he told Decrypt before election day. "Many business leaders are all making phone calls to Donald Trump to mend fences." "There’s definitely some momentum for Trump, in my opinion," Sigel added. Previously with Bitcoin cycles, the crypto has hit highs following the asset's quadrennial halving event. This time, it's different, though, and the crypto last hit an all-time high in March, just ahead of April's halving. Bitcoin's halving happens every four years and cuts miner rewards in half, forcing those who secure the network to work harder and allowing fewer digital coins to be minted and put into circulation. But Bitcoin's spike earlier this year arguably comes down to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January approved 10 of the vehicles, which make it easy for people to buy shares that track the price of Bitcoin and trade on stock exchanges. A flood of capital has since entered the space, as traditional investors, previously too cautious about buying the asset, can now do so easily via products by Wall Street titans such as BlackRock and Fidelity. Such funds have seen more than $20 billion worth of inflows so far this year.

After making leap from sporting greatness to the world of finance, deceitful Blackrock boy was soon hoisted with his own petard Brendan Mullin was one of the best centres Irish rugby has ever had, thanks to his pace and athleticism. His place in the Ireland team was rarely in doubt. Photo: Allsport Brendan Mullin was born in 1963 in Jerusalem, where his father was on assignment, and spent his early years in Israel. When the family returned to Dublin, he was educated at Blackrock College, studied law at Trinity College Dublin and then went to Oxford. In the amateur era, rugby was a ­hobby, not a job, but well-educated players from south Dublin could use their connections to forge a career in finance or business.

Title: ‘I was lucky to be there’ – No hard feelings as Garry Ringrose looks back on his first All Black experience

Garry Ringrose: 'I certainly feel if I’m not all-in in everything I can do to try and prepare, they are exceptionally good at exposing that.' Photo: Sportsfile Garry Ringrose had the best seat in the house as he watched history unfold at Solider Field in November 2016. Like Joey Carbery, Ringrose was named in an Ireland match-day squad for the first time, but rather than follow his former Blackrock College team-mate in helping to see out the historic victory over the All Blacks, he remained on the bench for the entire 80 minutes. Scrum-half Kieran Marmion found himself in a similar position in Chicago that day, but even looking back on it now, eight years later, there was no sense of bitterness on Ringrose’s part at missing out on such a momentous occasion. Instead, Joe Schmidt handed the centre his Test debut at home the following week in the slightly less glamorous win over Canada. “It was funny, I was 21,” Ringrose recalled. “Myself and Joey Carbery were on the bench and both of us would have been nervous going into the game. “I was lucky to be on the plane because Keith Earls got injured during the week and that gave me the opportunity to be on the bench. “I couldn’t believe that I’d been selected. After the game I had a text or two saying hard luck that I hadn’t got on but I was laughing to myself because that didn’t even cross my mind. “To be there for such a special occasion, I felt I was lucky to be over there. “Even the fact that Joey came on and played so well, I was coat-tailing on how well he had done because we had gone through the week together. “It wouldn’t have been a thing, any sort of frustration. I was just excited to be there and experience such a monumental day in Irish sports history, I think. Since then, I guess I’ve been lucky to play in the ones here. “There was one game, the autumn after the Lions tour when Robbie [Henshaw] and Bundee [Aki] would have been together [up until then] and Robbie was injured which gave me the opportunity to play and get the win on a special night in the Aviva. “Experiences like that stand out and you never take them for granted, to be lucky enough to beat such an exceptional side. It’ll take everything this week to try and repeat that.” As for what Schmidt said to Ringrose after keeping him on the bench against the All Blacks, given it is a rarity in modern-day rugby not to use all eight available replacements, Ringrose added: “I can’t remember exactly but I do remember after the game in the hotel, obviously everyone was celebrating, he let me know, just a heads-up, you’re going to be starting next week against Canada. “I was pretty nervous from that point on. I wouldn’t have expected or looked for an apology at all. Everyone was buzzing, it wasn’t even a thing.” Ringrose is set to be in the thick of the action against New Zealand at the Aviva Stadium on Friday night, as Ireland aim to finish a year, which has included a Six Nations title win and a Test victory in South Africa, on a high. “When I was younger in the first couple of squads you have the blinkers on, but in the last couple of years I’ve been able to look at it from the wider lens and appreciate the amount of support we have or that I can see around the country,” Ringrose (29) maintained. “And I don’t know what it is, there just seems to be a buzz about it, definitely in the World Cup. “I know my first World Cup was in Japan so it was unbelievable travelling support, but going through a World Cup that was a little bit closer to home and seeing and feeling the support was unbelievable. “And then there’s a continuation from there, I’ve certainly felt.” Ringrose’s battle with his opposite number Rieko Ioane, who may face a frosty reception from the Dublin crowd following his war of words with Johnny Sexton, is set to be one of many box-office match-ups. “I certainly feel if I’m not all-in in everything I can do to try and prepare, they are exceptionally good at exposing that,” Ringrose added. “And in the past it shows that even when we are all-in [with our] preparation, they can still expose it with the strength they have. “They’re a team you just have to be at your best against to try to beat them. And we’ve been lucky in the past in some of those seven games to get a win and then some unfortunate results in there as well. “It’s something I never take for granted, and I’m excited for the challenge. “I guess from my experience over the last couple of years, games can fall on such fine margins and against a team of their quality, even more so. “[It will be] unbelievably special and everyone in the group would be grateful to get an opportunity to play, to deliver for the support that will be there and the support that will be watching on TV. We’re just trying to do our best to prepare as best as we possibly can.”

Title: What the Latest Dow Shakeup Could Mean

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This week, two new stocks are joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nvidia Inc (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW). The Dow is a widely followed index made up of the 30 biggest companies with a history dating back to the 1800’s. NVDA and SHW will be replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow Inc. (DOW) – no relation to the index. This week, I examine past changes to the Dow’s constituents and explore how the stocks tended to perform after being added or removed. I have a list of 26 stocks that have joined the Dow Industrials since 1997. I looked at how those stocks performed after officially being added to the index. The table below summarizes the returns. The second table is for comparison, and it shows what the returns looked like had you purchased the index instead of the individual stocks. The results are mixed. The stocks averaged an 8% return over the first three months after being added to the index with 65% of the returns being positive. However, a year after the additions, those same stocks were up just 1.74% on average, with less than half of the returns positive. Based on this, avoid NVDA and SHW and put that money in a Dow index fund. Purchasing the Dow Index rather than the stocks would have yielded a 7.45% return on average with 84% of returns positive over the next year. The last change to the Dow was earlier in February, when Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). Since then, AMZN has gained over 12%, while WBA is down more than 50%. The table below shows the stocks added to the Dow since 2010. These stocks have fared better than the summarized table above but still, less than half have outperformed the index over the next six months and year. My list of stocks removed from the Dow is less than stocks added, because more of these companies have gone out of business or have been bought out. So perhaps we’re not getting the full picture. The 18 stocks I have data for have performed terribly, especially immediately after leaving the index. These stocks have averaged over an 8% loss over the next month of trading after leaving the index with only 17% being positive or beating the Dow Index. The six-month returns also underperform by a lot averaging a loss of 2.7% with 33% positive. Nine of the 18 stocks, however, have beaten The Dow over the next six months. Here’s the list of individual stocks removed from the index since 2010. These ten stocks show significant underperformance in the first month of trading, averaging a loss of 3.8% with just 30% positive and 30% beating the Dow Index. Over the longer term, the stocks eliminated from the index have done much better than stocks added. Over the next year, these stocks averaged an impressive 28% return with 67% of them beating the index. The stocks added to The Dow since 2010 have averaged a return of 6.3% with just 44% beating the Dow Index (see table above). One way to look at index changes, especially on such a popular index, is as a driver or indicator of sentiment. Stocks added to the blue-chip index could gin up some positive sentiment, while those eliminated might get the stocks off some people’s radars. I could argue the data above supports this interpretation. New stocks in the index underperformed and have been less likely to beat the index than those kicked out of the index. I’m focusing on the data since 2010. Based on the analysis, perhaps wait at least a month then take a look at the two stocks recently eliminated, INTC and SHW. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Why Professional Investors Often Misjudge the Market After a Presidential Election

Time Published: 2024-11-05T21:12:13Z

Professional investors often assume they are free of political bias. However, research suggests this is far from true. Political bias is proven to cost investors who may over- or under-estimate the state of the economy depending on whether their preferred party is in power. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. In a June Nasdaq article, investor Martin Tiller observed how many left-leaning investors dumped stocks after Donald Trump’s victory in 2016 and right-leaning investors after Barack Obama’s victory in 2008. Both were motivated by notions that the wrong party had won the election and the economy would pay a price. Yet, the S&P 500 consistently grew in the months following each president’s inauguration, duping the investors who let their bias get in the way. Academic research suggests this is a widespread phenomenon. A 2017 Journal of Financial Markets study highlighted how individuals’ investment behaviors shifted when their preferred political party held the White House. The study found that when their favored party was in power, investors became more optimistic, perceived markets as less risky, and increased allocations to high-beta, small-cap, and value stocks. Consequently, nonpartisan investors consistently outperformed their Democratic- and Republican-leaning counterparts, according to a University of Chicago study of fund performance from 2015 to 2021. Political bias affects not only market perspectives but also stock selection. Mutual fund managers often hold onto losing stocks issued by politically allied companies longer than justified, a behavioral pattern known as the “disposition effect,” according to a study by the University of Kansas of nearly 1,300 actively managed mutual funds between 2000 and 2015. In other words, fund managers may overestimate the competence of companies led by executives with similar political beliefs to theirs. The researchers found that funds with more politically-motivated stock selection have lower return-to-risk ratios. Political bias isn’t confined to equity investors. A 2020 study tracking credit analysts from Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s between 2000 and 2018 showed that those not aligned with the sitting president’s party tended to issue more frequent downgrades of corporate credit ratings. Nevertheless, historical market data provides a stark reality check. Long-term market performance has proven resilient regardless of which political party holds power. The S&P 500, for example, has typically risen regardless of partisan shifts in Washington. While executive decisions from the White House can be large in scope and have long-term impact, markets can often work through them. For example, when Trump launched a trade war with China in September 2019, some analysts expected Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone sales to fall by as much as 8 million units and its share price to plummet. In the following 12 months, Apple’s stock rose 160 percent compared to the S&P 500’s 16 percent. Likewise, after President Joe Biden’s inauguration, many expected his green energy policies would hurt oil and natural gas companies. And yet, Morningstar’s data finds U.S. energy companies outperformed the S&P 500 in the year following. Political sentiments can also influence how major shareholders vote on corporate policies. Major mutual funds and asset managers tend to vote in lockstep with the political party in control at the time, according to joint research from the City University of Hong Kong and INSEAD published in the International Banker. Examining shareholder voting behavior between 2004 and 2021, the researchers found major asset managers were substantially more likely to support environmental and social initiatives when a Democrat was in the White House than when a Republican was. However, instead of bias getting in the way, another possible explanation is that major asset managers, like BlackRock (BLK), StateStreet and Vanguard, may be acting in accordance with the prevailing political party to avoid regulatory scrutiny. Further solidifying their findings, the researchers noted that voting behavior on corporate policies unrelated to environmental and social justice issues remained consistent, regardless of which political party was in power. Data confirms that the stock market reflects investors’ election jitters. VIX, an index measuring volatility in the stock market, is about 6 percent higher during election years than in other years. A higher VIX reading signals increased expected volatility and heightened market uncertainty from investors. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: X Is a White-Supremacist Site
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/11/x-white-supremacist-site/680538/
Time Published: 2024-11-05T19:41:17Z

Donald Trump has won the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Read more from our writers on what happens next: Elon Musk has made one of Twitter’s most glaring problems into a core feature on X. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration. X has always had a Nazi problem. I’ve covered the site, formerly known as Twitter, for more than a decade and reported extensively on its harassment problems, its verification (and then de-verification) of a white nationalist, and the glut of anti-Semitic hatred that roiled the platform in 2016. But something is different today. Heaps of unfiltered posts that plainly celebrate racism, anti-Semitism, and outright Nazism are easily accessible and possibly even promoted by the site’s algorithms. All the while, Elon Musk—a far-right activist and the site’s owner, who is campaigning for and giving away millions to help elect Donald Trump—amplifies horrendous conspiracy theories about voter fraud, migrants run amok, and the idea that Jewish people hate white people. Twitter was always bad if you knew where to look, but because of Musk, X is far worse. (X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this article.) It takes little effort to find neo-Nazi accounts that have built up substantial audiences on X. “Thank you all for 7K,” one white-nationalist meme account posted on October 17, complete with a heil-Hitler emoji reference. One week later, the account, which mostly posts old clips of Hitler speeches and content about how “Hitler was right,” celebrated 14,000 followers. One post, a black-and-white video of Nazis goose-stepping, has more than 187,000 views. Another racist and anti-Semitic video about Jewish women and Black men—clearly AI-generated—has more than 306,000 views. It was also posted in late October. Many who remain on the platform have noticed X decaying even more than usual in recent months. “I’ve seen SO many seemingly unironic posts like this on Twitter recently this is getting insane,” one X user posted in response to a meme that the far-right influencer Stew Peters recently shared. It showed an image of Adolf Hitler holding a telephone with overlaid text reading, “Hello … 2024? Are you guys starting to get it yet?” Peters appended the commentary, “Yes. We’ve noticed.” The idea is simply that Hitler was right, and X users ate it up: As of this writing, the post has received about 67,000 likes, 10,000 reposts, and 11.4 million views. When Musk took over, in 2022, there were initial reports that hate speech (anti-Black and anti-Semitic slurs) was surging on the platform. By December of that year, one research group described the increase in hate speech as “unprecedented.” And it seems to only have gotten worse. There are far more blatant examples of racism now, even compared with a year ago. In September, the World Bank halted advertising on X after its promoted ads were showing up in the replies to pro-Nazi and white-nationalist content from accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers. Search queries such as Hitler was right return posts with tens of thousands of views—they’re indistinguishable from the poison once relegated to the worst sites on the internet, including 4chan, Gab, and Stormfront. The hatred isn’t just coming from anonymous fringe posters either. Late last month, Clay Higgins, a Republican congressman from Louisiana, published a racist, threatening post about the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, saying they’re from the “nastiest country in the western hemisphere.” Then he issued an ultimatum: “All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,” he wrote in the post, referencing Inauguration Day. Higgins eventually deleted the post at the request of his House colleagues on both sides of the aisle but refused to apologize. “I can put up another controversial post tomorrow if you want me to. I mean, we do have freedom of speech. I’ll say what I want,” he told CNN later that day. And although Higgins did eventually try to walk his initial post back, clarifying that he was really referring to Haitian gangs, the sentiment he shared with CNN is right. The lawmaker can put up another vile post maligning an entire country whenever he desires. Not because of his right to free speech—which exists to protect against government interference—but because of how Musk chooses to operate his platform. Despite the social network’s policy that prohibits “incitement of harassment,” X seemingly took no issue with Higgins’s racist post or its potential to cause real-world harm for Springfield residents. (The town has already closed and evacuated its schools twice because of bomb threats.) And why would X care? The platform, which reinstated thousands of banned accounts following Musk’s takeover, in 2022—accounts that belong to QAnon supporters, political hucksters, conspiracy theorists, and at least one bona fide neo-Nazi—is so inundated with bigoted memes, racist AI slop, and unspeakable slurs that Higgins’s post seemed almost measured by comparison. In the past, when Twitter seemed more interested in enforcing content-moderation standards, the lawmaker’s comments may have resulted in a ban or some other disciplinary response: On X, he found an eager, sympathetic audience willing to amplify his hateful message. His deleted post is instructive, though, as a way to measure the degradation of X under Musk. The site is a political project run by a politically radicalized centibillionaire. The worthwhile parts of Twitter (real-time news, sports, culture, silly memes, spontaneous encounters with celebrity accounts) have been drowned out by hateful garbage. X is no longer a social-media site with a white-supremacy problem, but a white-supremacist site with a social-media problem. Musk has certainly bent the social network to support his politics, which has recently involved joking on Tucker Carlson’s show (which streams on X) that “nobody is even bothering to try to kill Kamala” and repurposing the @america handle from an inactive user to turn it into a megaphone for his pro-Trump super PAC. Musk has also quite clearly reengineered the site so that users see him, and his tweets, whether or not they follow him. When Musk announced his intent to purchase Twitter, in April 2022, the New York Times columnist Ezra Klein aptly noted that “Musk reveals what he wants Twitter to be by how he acts on it.” By this logic, it would seem that X is vying to be the official propaganda outlet not just for Trump generally but also for the “Great Replacement” theory, which states that there is a global plot to eradicate the white race and its culture through immigration. In just the past year, Musk has endorsed multiple posts about the conspiracy theory. In November 2023, in response to a user named @breakingbaht who accused Jews of supporting bringing “hordes of minorities” into the United States, Musk replied, “You have said the actual truth.” Musk’s post was viewed more than 8 million times. Read: Musk’s Twitter is the blueprint for a MAGA government Though Musk has publicly claimed that he doesn’t “subscribe” to the “Great Replacement” theory, he appears obsessed with the idea that Republican voters in America are under attack from immigrants. Last December, he posted a misleading graph suggesting that the number of immigrants arriving illegally was overtaking domestic birth rates. He has repeatedly referenced a supposed Democratic plot to “legalize vast numbers of illegals” and put an end to fair elections. He has falsely suggested that the Biden administration was “flying ‘asylum seekers’, who are fast-tracked to citizenship, directly into swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Arizona” and argued that, soon, “everywhere in America will be like the nightmare that is downtown San Francisco.” According to a recent Bloomberg analysis of 53,000 of Musk’s posts, the billionaire has posted more about immigration and voter fraud than any other topic (more than 1,300 posts in total), garnering roughly 10 billion views. But Musk’s interests extend beyond the United States. This summer, during a period of unrest and rioting in the United Kingdom over a mass stabbing that killed three children, the centibillionaire used his account to suggest that a civil war there was “inevitable.” He also shared (and subsequently deleted) a conspiracy theory that the U.K. government was building detainment camps for people rioting against Muslims. Additionally, X was instrumental in spreading misinformation and fueling outrage among far-right, anti-immigration protesters. In Springfield, Ohio, X played a similar role as a conduit for white supremacists and far-right extremists to fuel real-world harm. One of the groups taking credit for singling out Springfield’s Haitian community was Blood Tribe, a neo-Nazi group known for marching through city streets waving swastikas. Blood Tribe had been focused on the town for months, but not until prominent X accounts (including Musk’s, J. D. Vance’s, and Trump’s) seized on a Facebook post from the region did Springfield become a national target. “It is no coincidence that there was an online rumor mill ready to amplify any social media posts about Springfield because Blood Tribe has been targeting the town in an effort to stoke racial resentment against ‘subhuman’ Haitians,” the journalist Robert Tracinski wrote recently. Tracinski argues that social-media channels (like X) have been instrumental in transferring neo-Nazi propaganda into the public consciousness—all the way to the presidential-debate stage. He is right. Musk’s platform has become a political tool for stoking racial hatred online and translating it into harassment in the physical world. The ability to drag fringe ideas and theories into mainstream political discourse has long been a hallmark of X, even back when it was known as Twitter. There’s always been a trade-off with the platform’s ability to narrow the distance between activists and people in positions of power. Social-justice movements such as the Arab Spring and Black Lives Matter owe some of the success of their early organizing efforts to the platform. Yet the website has also been one of the most reliable mainstream destinations on the internet to see Photoshopped images of public figures (or their family members) in gas chambers, or crude, racist cartoons of Jewish men. Now, under Musk’s stewardship, X seems to run in only one direction. The platform eschews healthy conversation. It abhors nuance, instead favoring constant escalation and engagement-baiting behavior. And it empowers movements that seek to enrage and divide. In April, an NBC News investigation found that “at least 150 paid ‘Premium’ subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months.” According to research from the extremism expert Colin Henry, since Musk’s purchase, there’s been a decline in anti-Semitic posts on 4chan’s infamous “anything goes” forum, and a simultaneous rise in posts targeting Jewish people on X. X’s own transparency reports show that the social network has allowed hateful content to flourish on its site. In its last report before Musk’s acquisition, in just the second half of 2021, Twitter suspended about 105,000 of the more than 5 million accounts reported for hateful conduct. In the first half of 2024, according to X, the social network received more than 66 million hateful-conduct reports, but suspended just 2,361 accounts. It’s not a perfect comparison, as the way X reports and analyzes data has changed under Musk, but the company is clearly taking action far less frequently. Read: I’m running out of ways to explain how bad this is Because X has made it more difficult for researchers to access data by switching to a paid plan that prices out many academics, it is now difficult to get a quantitative understanding of the platform’s degradation. The statistics that do exist are alarming. Research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that in just the first month of Musk’s ownership, anti–Black American slurs used on the platform increased by 202 percent. The Anti-Defamation League found that anti-Semitic tweets on the platform increased by 61 percent in just two weeks after Musk’s takeover. But much of the evidence is anecdotal. The Washington Post summed up a recent report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, noting that pro-Hitler content “reached the largest audiences on X [relative to other social-media platforms], where it was also most likely to be recommended via the site’s algorithm.” Since Musk took over, X has done the following: None of this is accidental. The output of a platform tells you what it is designed to do: In X’s case, all of this is proof of a system engineered to give voice to hateful ideas and reward those who espouse them. If one is to judge X by its main exports, then X, as it exists now under Musk, is a white-supremacist website. You might scoff at this notion, especially if you, like me, have spent nearly two decades willingly logged on to the site, or if you, like me, have had your professional life influenced in surprising, occasionally delightful ways by the platform. Even now, I can scroll through the site’s algorithmic pond scum and find things worth saving—interesting commentary, breaking news, posts and observations that make me laugh. But these exceptional morsels are what make the platform so insidious, in part because they give cover to the true political project that X now represents and empowers. As I was preparing to write this story, I visited some of the most vile corners of the internet. I’ve monitored these spaces for years, and yet this time, I was struck by how little distance there was between them and what X has become. It is impossible to ignore: The difference between X and a known hateful site such as Gab are people like myself. The majority of users are no doubt creators, businesses, journalists, celebrities, political junkies, sports fans, and other perfectly normal people who hold their nose and cling to the site. We are the human shield of respectability that keeps Musk’s disastrous $44 billion investment from being little more than an algorithmically powered Stormfront. The justifications—the lure of the community, the (now-limited) ability to bear witness to news in real time, and of the reach of one’s audience of followers—feel particularly weak today. X’s cultural impact is still real, but its promotional use is nonexistent. (A recent post linking to a story of mine generated 289,000 impressions and 12,900 interactions, but only 948 link clicks—a click rate of roughly 0.00328027682 percent.) NPR, which left the platform in April 2023, reported almost negligible declines in traffic referrals after abandoning the site. Continuing to post on X has been indefensible for some time. But now, more than ever, there is no good justification for adding one’s name to X’s list of active users. To leave the platform, some have argued, is to cede an important ideological battleground to the right. I’ve been sympathetic to this line of thinking, but the battle, on this particular platform, is lost. As long as Musk owns the site, its architecture will favor his political allies. If you see posting to X as a fight, then know it is not a fair one. For example: In October, Musk shared a fake screenshot of an Atlantic article, manipulated to show a fake headline—his post, which he never deleted, garnered more than 18 million views. The Atlantic’s X post debunking Musk’s claim received just 28,000 views. Musk is unfathomably rich. He’s used that money to purchase a platform, take it private, and effectively turn it into a megaphone for the world’s loudest racists. Now he’s attempting to use it to elect a corrupt, election-denying felon to the presidency. To stay on X is not an explicit endorsement of this behavior, but it does help enable it. I’m not at all suggesting—as Musk has previously alleged—that the site be shut down or that Musk should be silenced. But there’s no need to stick around and listen. Why allow Musk to appear even slightly more credible by lending our names, our brands, and our movements to a platform that makes the world more dangerous for real people? To my dismay, I’ve hid from these questions for too long. Now that I’ve confronted them, I have no good answers.

Title: Elon Musk’s Twitter Takeover Set Off a Race to the Bottom

In the final lead-up to the US presidential election, Elon Musk has thrown the full weight of his celebrity and his resources behind former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump. He has appeared with Trump on the campaign trail; pumped money into a pro-Trump PAC (which has, in turn, bought ads on the platform he owns); and made X a hotbed of right-wing conspiracy theories, some of which he has personally boosted, that many experts say are designed to undermine faith in the outcome of the elections. But Musk’s behavior is also having another effect: It’s taking scrutiny off other tech leaders and companies, even as they cozy up to Trump or roll back policies that would protect the information ecosystem ahead of a major election. “In a race to the bottom, Elon Musk paved the way for a new, toxic tech basement,” says Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the nonprofit Free Press. “Yet, as long as other platforms aren’t quite as abysmal, they squeak by under cover of Twitter’s failures.” Social media companies have largely replaced traditional media conglomerates as gateways to information. According to a Pew Research study, 54 percent of adults now get at least some of their news from social media. And that number is much higher for people below the age of 50. Sixty-four percent of people aged 30–49 and 78 percent of people 18–29 get news from social media. “[Musk] is smart enough to understand that to control the narrative, you want to control the media,” says a former Twitter employee. “And social media is media.” But these companies don’t face the same kind of restrictions and responsibilities that traditional media do. Section 230 prevents social media companies from being held legally liable for the content on their platforms. Content moderation is largely voluntary, except in cases where the content itself is illegal (like child sexual abuse material), which has its own consequences. A 2020 study from the Harvard Misinformation Review found that people who relied on social media for their news were more likely to believe misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic. A different Pew Research study, also from 2020, found that Americans who relied on social media for their news had lower political knowledge than those who didn’t. But for years, public pressure from government officials, civil society, and the media pushed tech companies to invest in teams and tools that could at least somewhat address issues of hate speech or misinformation on their platforms, so they could say they were making a good-faith effort to deal with the issue. Musk’s purchase of Twitter signaled a change, according to six former trust and safety employees from Twitter and Meta. When Musk took over Twitter in October 2022, he quickly fired more than 50 percent of the company’s workers, including almost all of the company’s trust and safety and policy staff—the people tasked with creating and enforcing the platform’s policies around things like hate speech, violent content, conspiracy theories, and mis- and disinformation. Since then, Meta, Google, Amazon, and Discord have all made cuts to trust and safety staff. Shortly after Musk purged Twitter of its trust and safety teams, other companies began layoffs. In November 2022, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, including many trust and safety employees. In January 2023, Google followed suit, axing 12,000 people. Earlier this year, Twitch, which is owned by Amazon, disbanded its Safety Advisory Council. “I think that Elon really opened the floodgates,” says one former Meta employee. “So then other tech brands were like, ‘We can do that too, because we won't be the black sheep for it.’” Meta spokesperson Corey Chambliss tells WIRED that the company has “40,000 people globally working on safety and security—more than during the 2020 cycle, when we had a global team of 35,000 people working in this area,” though he did not address how many of those people are staff versus outsourced workers. Musk’s sudden firings made it so that “anybody else could come along and nicely fire their teams and give them severance and it was nicer. Better,” says a former Twitter employee who was fired by Musk. After Musk fired the trust and safety staff, experts warned that this cut, coupled with Musk’s “free speech absolutism,” would allow toxic content to flood the platform and ultimately cause an exodus of users and advertisers, leading to Twitter’s eventual demise. Hate speech and misinformation did increase, and advertisers did pull their dollars. Last year, X fired members of what remained of its elections team. Around the same time, Musk posted on X, saying, “Oh you mean the ‘Election Integrity’ Team that was undermining election integrity? Yeah, they’re gone.” But X is still alive and kicking. Musk’s behavior, say the former employees, acted as cover for other platforms that saw trust and safety work as a burdensome cost. The work of teams focused on ad sales or user engagement drives growth and money for platforms. Trust and safety teams, former employees say, do not. This makes them easy targets when companies tighten their belts. “I think [layoffs] were something Mark [Zuckerberg] wanted to do for a long time,” says the former Meta employee. “And so, if Twitter can get away with having less good technology and less good infrastructure than other companies, and is still getting rid of thousands of people, which is proportionally way more than any amount laid off by Google or anyone else, then I think that that kind of empowered other companies too.” Chambliss says that Musk’s decisions did not play a role in Meta’s layoffs, referring to a 2023 post about the company’s “year of efficiency.” It’s not just staffing that has shifted since Musk took the helm at X. Google and Meta have made significant changes to how they handle political content and mis- and disinformation. Last year, YouTube, which is owned by Google, announced that it would “stop removing content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past US presidential elections.” Google spokesperson Elena Hernandez told WIRED, “There were no cuts to the Trust and Safety teams that work on elections. We continue to make significant investments in the people, policies, and systems that enable Google and YouTube to be a reliable source for election-related news and information.” Hernandez did not respond to questions about whether the company would be updating its policies around election fraud claims in anticipation of the US presidential elections. Recent reporting from The New York Times found that lies about the election have since spread widely on the platform. In previous years, a story like that might have put pressure on YouTube to enforce or change its policies, but now, conservative activist Christopher Rufo wrote on X, “in a post-Elon environment, YouTube's response is: ‘The ability to openly debate political ideas, even those that are controversial, is an important value—especially in the midst of election season.’” “I think the public antics of Musk are diverting attention away from other companies who continue to launch products or make policy changes that demand careful thinking and transparency,” says Sabhanaz Rashid Diya, founder of the Tech Global Institute, a think tank focused on tech policy and a former Meta employee. Earlier this year, Meta announced that it would no longer recommend political content to users on Threads and Instagram—though what exactly counts as politics remains unclear. Last year, the company removed restrictions on ads claiming the 2020 election was stolen and on Covid-19 misinformation. In July it removed restrictions on Trump’s Facebook account, which has 35 million followers. In August, less than three months ahead of the elections, it also wound down the tool Crowdtangle, which allowed journalists and civil society to monitor content on Meta’s platforms. (After taking over X, Musk announced that he would charge $40,000 for access to the platform’s API). While X under Musk has presented a whole host of new issues for advocates and civil society, less attention has been paid to other, established platforms having many of the same problems they’ve had for years. Reporting from WIRED found that nearly four years after the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, militia groups are still organizing on Facebook, with the platform even autogenerating pages for interested users. Meta’s and TikTok’s systems still can’t reliably detect ads containing election disinformation. Amazon’s Alexa told users the 2020 election was stolen. “We do not have visibility on whether ad models in the lead-up to major elections have been changed, or whether researchers have been able to meaningfully engage with platforms and user metrics to study key information trends,” says Diya. “We still have unresolved questions about basic product or policy features that warrant continued scrutiny and should not be sidelined amidst specific individuals or one company monopolizing airtime.” “Musk doesn’t take responsibility for anything on his platform, so it makes it a lot easier for other platforms to do the same,” says Alexandra Pardal, CEO of Digital Action, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on human rights and technology. “He’s changed norms about what’s acceptable and not, about what a responsible social media platform looks like. Musk has successfully masked [these changes] by making this the Elon Show.” In a recent interview with the Acquired podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he regretted allowing Meta to take responsibility for things that he saw as outside its mandate or control. “People are basically blaming social media and the tech industry for all these things in society—if we’re saying, we’re really gonna do our part to fix this stuff, I think there were a bunch of people who just took that and were like, oh, you're taking responsibility for that? Let me, like, kick you for more stuff.” Bloomberg also noted a shift in Zuckerberg’s approach to the 2024 election—namely, to avoid saying much about it at all. Musk is obviously not the only driving force for this change. Tech companies have come under increasing scrutiny from both sides of the aisle, particularly from the GOP. This has made it particularly painful—and risky—for them to take action on certain topics. For instance, last year, a federal judge issued an injunction preventing social media companies from talking to the government, saying that Biden officials “engaged in a broad pressure campaign designed to coerce social-media companies into suppressing speakers, viewpoints, and content disfavored by the government." For companies like Meta, that meant that their threat detection teams were unable to alert or hear from federal agencies about issues. The Supreme Court ruled this summer that complainants lacked standing. In August, Zuckerberg issued a letter to Jim Jordan’s congressional Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, saying that the company had, indeed bowed to government pressure to remove misinformation about Covid-19. (Three former Meta employees who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity say that they did not get the sense that government pressure was behind Meta’s choices to suppress or remove Covid-19 misinformation at the time.) Pardal says that if Musk was not behaving so outrageously, she doubts that Zuckerberg “would be saying he made a mistake.” And Trump, it seems, approves. In an interview with the Barstool Sports podcast Bussin’ With the Boys, Trump said, “I actually believe [Zuckerberg’s] staying out of the election, which is nice.” The former president has also claimed that other tech executives, including Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook, are supporters. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, prevented an editorial endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris from running, the same day that executives from his space company, Blue Origin, met with Trump, signaling a willingness on the part of the industry to cooperate with a possible second Trump administration. (Bezos appeared unmoved, even in the face of more than 200,000 people canceling their subscriptions to the paper.) But none of these nods toward Trump are as obvious as Musk’s support for the former president, and the use of X to seed mis- and disinformation about the election, says Pardal. “[Musk] has drawn attention away from other tech companies and onto himself, when it comes to tech harms,” says Pardal. “Now we are all talking about what Elon says next, and moving away from the discussion about the decline in platform safety at a time of exponentially rising risks.” You can follow all of WIRED's 2024 presidential election coverage here.

Title: Brendan Mullin one of the last great Irish players of rugby’s amateur era

Brendan Mullin (61), who has been found guilty on 12 charges of stealing hundreds of thousands of euro from Bank of Ireland Private Bank when he was its managing director a decade ago, was one of the last great Irish players of rugby’s amateur era. Born in Jerusalem, he was educated at Blackrock College, which he captained to a Schools Senior Cup success, scoring a hat-trick of tries in the final against King’s Hospital. He was also twice the senior boys All Ireland 110m hurdles champion (1980-1981). Mullin studied Law at Dublin University while representing Trinity at rugby. He also played club rugby with Blackrock College and London Irish. Mullin then headed for Oxford University, where he won a “Blue” playing in the annual Varsity match against Cambridge. Having represented Leinster and Ireland at schools’ level, he graduated to the senior ranks for province and country. He made his Ireland debut against the Grand Slam-winning Australia side in November 1984, a losing start as the home side went down 16-9, but there was better fortune around the corner as he was part of Mick Doyle’s Triple Crown and championship winning side (1985) in his rookie Test season. Mullin scored his first Irish try in that campaign, where he blocked down England fullback Chris Martin’s kick and regathered to dot down. An elegant centre with blistering pace and an underappreciated kicking game, he played alongside some very talented three-quarters in Irish backlines such as Simon Geoghegan, Dave Curtis, Jim Staples, Michael Kiernan, Keith Crossan, Trevor Ringland and Hugo MacNeill. [ Ex-rugby international Brendan Mullin found guilty of stealing hundreds of thousands of euro from bankOpens in new window ] A member of the Ireland squad for the first-ever World Cup in 1987, Mullin was subsequently selected for the 1989 British & Irish Lions tour to Australia under head coach Ian McGeechan, one of four Irish players in the original touring party, alongside Paul Dean, Steve Smith and Donal Lenihan, and played well enough to win a place in the first Test against the Wallabies, playing alongside Mike Hall (Wales). Mullin broke George Stephenson’s 62-year-old record as Ireland’s leading try scorer when he crossed for his 15th in a 28-25 defeat to Scotland at Murrayfield in March 1991 The Lions were thrashed 30-12, and among the changes for the final two Tests, both of which the Lions won to claim the series 2-1, was a new centre partnership of Scott Hastings and Jerry Guscott. Mullin did play another Test for the Lions, against France later that year, to celebrate the bicentenary of the French Revolution. He broke George Stephenson’s 62-year-old record as Ireland’s leading try scorer when he crossed for his 15th in a 28-25 defeat to Scotland at Murrayfield in March 1991, and later that year was part of the Ireland team that suffered a narrow World Cup quarter-final defeat at Lansdowne Road to the eventual champions, Australia. By the time he retired from rugby – he came back to play in the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, having been out of international rugby for two years, and retired for good after the quarter-final defeat to France, the last of his 55 Irish caps – Mullin had added another two tries to push the new Irish record to 17, a milestone that he retained for a dozen years until broken by Brian O’Driscoll. [ Brendan Mullin one of the last great Irish players of rugby’s amateur eraOpens in new window ] The former Ireland captain eclipsed the mark when he scored his 18th Irish try against Italy in Rome (2003) on his 35th cap, 20 fewer than it took Mullin, who sent O’Driscoll a congratulatory note and a signed jersey from that final cap against France in the 1995 World Cup. He said in a subsequent interview when asked about losing the record to O’Driscoll: “No regrets at all. It’s a milestone. It was something I was very proud to hold on to for a while, but it’s something to be broken. Many more players will break that milestone and that’s good for Irish rugby, while Brian will go on to score many more tries.” Mullin is due to be sentenced on November 25th.

Title: A new weight loss drug could beat Ozempic's side effect problem

The Denmark-based drug maker Zealand Pharma said Tuesday that its experimental weight-loss drug could help patients lose pounds with fewer side effects than current anti-obesity medications on the market. The company said that only about a third of patients that took up to 4.8 milligram doses of its drug petrelintide during an early-stage clinical trial experienced nausea — one of the most common side effects of popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. Zealand revealed the new finding at the industry conference ObesityWeek in San Antonio, Bloomberg reports. Zealand is pitching petrelinde as an alternative for patients who can’t tolerate GLP-1 treatments, which can include common side effects like nauseau, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Zealand Pharma reported in June that there were no serious or severe adverse events during the study and only one out 48 participants dropped out of the trial due to side effects. “These results support our conviction that petrelintide is very well tolerated and can potentially play an important role as an alternative to incretin-based therapies for the management of overweight and obesity,” said Zealand chief medical officer David Kendall in a press release, at the time. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Zealand’s petrelintide works different from Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs as it doesn’t mimic the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Instead, it mimics a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas that increases satiety, known as amylin. Zealand previously reported in June that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost on average 8.6% of their weight. For comparison, a clinical trial of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+2.18%) Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. The company plans start a mid-stage trial of the drug later this year and expects it could hit the market in 2029 or 2030, according to Bloomberg. In August, the company said it is looking for a potential partnership with a big pharma company to help it develop, manufacture, and sell petrelintide. GLP-1s are a class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite. Demand for these medications have turned Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY+2.79%), the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Now, several pharmaceutical companies are working to introduce new drugs to get in on the demand. In addition to Zealand Pharma, Viking Therapeutics, Regeneron, Amgen, and Pfizer are all developing new weight-loss drugs.

Title: Amazon gets FAA approval for new delivery drone as it begins tests in Arizona

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Amazon said Tuesday it received regulatory approval to begin flying a smaller, quieter version of its delivery drone, the latest step in its long-running efforts to get the futuristic program off the ground. The company unveiled the new drone, called the MK30, in November 2022. It said then that the MK30, in addition to the other changes, would fly through light rain and have twice the range of earlier models. Amazon said the Federal Aviation Administration’s approval includes permission to fly the MK30 over longer distances and beyond the visual line of sight of pilots. The agency granted a similar waiver for Amazon’s Prime Air program in May, though that was limited to flights in College Station, Texas, one of the cities where it has been conducting tests. Alongside the FAA approval, Matt McCardle, head of regulatory affairs for Prime Air, said the company is starting to make drone deliveries Tuesday near Phoenix, Arizona. In April, Amazon said it planned to spin up drone operations in Tolleson, a city west of Phoenix, after it shut down an earlier test site in Lockeford, California. The company will dispatch the drones near one of its warehouses in Tolleson as it looks to integrate Prime Air more closely into its existing logistics network and further speed up deliveries. An FAA spokesperson said the agency granted Amazon permission to conduct beyond visual line of sight deliveries in Tolleson on Oct. 31. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos first unveiled plans for the ambitious service more than a decade ago, remarking at the time that the program could be up and running within five years. Despite Amazon investing billions of dollars into the program, progress has been slow. Prime Air encountered regulatory hurdles, missed deadlines and had layoffs last year, coinciding with widespread cost-cutting efforts by CEO Andy Jassy. The program also lost some key executives, including its primary liaison with the FAA and its founding leader. Amazon hired former Boeing executive David Carbon to run the operation. It has also encountered pushback from some residents in the cities where it is trialing drone deliveries. Residents in College Station complained about the noise levels enough that it prompted the city’s mayor to mention the concerns in a letter to the FAA, CNBC previously reported. In response, Amazon executives told residents the company would identify a new drone delivery launch site by October 2025. Amazon is not the only company trying to crack delivery by drone. It is competing with Wing, owned by Google parent Alphabet; UPS; Walmart; and a host of startups including Zipline and Matternet.

Title: Vornado Reports Strong Office Leasing as NYU Master Leases 770 Broadway
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2024/11/vornado-reports-strong-office-leasing-nyu-master-leases-770-broadway/
Time Published: 2024-11-05T18:40:41Z
Full Content:
© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Steven Roth’s Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) reported lower cash flow in the third quarter of 2024 than it generated in the previous year’s third quarter, but the real estate investment trust emphasized its improving office leasing numbers — with New York University agreeing to master lease 1.1 million square feet at 770 Broadway — with high rents as it winds down the year. During Tuesday’s third quarter earnings call, Vornado reported funds from operations reached $99.25 million in the third quarter of 2024, down from $119.48 in the previous year’s third quarter. Moreover, funds from operations for the first nine months of the year hit $352.9 million, down from $382.5 million compared to the first nine months of 2023. The firm’s dividend to shareholders in the third quarter ended at 52 cents per diluted share, less than 66 cents per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Roth struck a confident and defiant tone when reporting the firm’s financials, and said that Vornado expects to pay a dividend of 68 cents per share to shareholders at the end of the year in order to conserve cash. In 2023, Vornado suspended dividend payments beginning in April of that year. “While our business is financially better and improving, we’ll continue to be rigorous with cash management,” he said. “This strategy has been understood and is endorsed by our major shareholders. I expect as conditions normalize, so will our dividend.” Vornado president and chief financial officer Michael J. Franco said that the quarter’s financial results were expected to be down from the previous year due to “items previously forecasted,” notably recent vacancies at several Manhattan office properties. “This decrease was primarily attributable to lower [net-operating income] from known move-outs, largely at 770 Broadway, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 280 Park Avenue, and higher net interest expenses, both of which we have previously discussed,” said Franco. Those move-outs included Facebook parent company meta dropping 275,000 square feet at 770 Broadway when its lease expires this year. However, Vornado got a break as it announced Tuesday that NYU agreed to master-lease the entire 1.1 million-square-foot office portion of the Broadway building. But both Roth and Franco pointed to encouraging leasing and occupancy numbers to make the case that the REIT’s office-heavy business model has finally turned the corner after several years of post-COVID uncertainty. Roth reported that year-to-date leasing reached 2.5 million square-feet company-wide, including 2.1 million square feet in Manhattan. He said that he’s confident the firm will reach between 3.5 million and 3.8 million square feet of leases in Manhattan by the end of the year, which would be the second-highest annual amount in the firm’s history, with “the highest starting rents ever.” “Activity is robust,” said Roth. “No new supply always begets a landlord’s market. Our rents are going up, I’m extremely optimistic, and the stock market seems to agree.” Vornado’s stock price opened at $42.81 on Tuesday, up from the $22.88 it sat at on Nov. 6, 2023. Aside from the NYU deal, Roth and Franco highlighted several other large leasing transactions in the firm’s Manhattan portfolio. Vornado leased 740,000 square feet of office space in the third quarter, including 297,000 square feet that Google renewed at 85 10th Avenue and leasing totals of 70,000 square feet of space at Penn 1, with an average starting rent of $119 per square foot. The NYU deal at 770 Broadway includes an upfront payment of prepaid rent that will allow Vornado to pay off its $700 million loan on the property, according to Roth. All told, the firm leased 2 million square feet in New York City across 68 transactions in the first nine months of 2024, with average starting rent of $112 per square foot, according to Franco. “The tide has clearly shifted in the New York, Class-A office market: leasing activity is strong and gaining momentum and availability are declining, particularly for large blocks of space,” said Franco. Vornado reported office occupancy of 87.5 percent in the third quarter, down from 89.3 percent in the previous quarter. Franco blamed the expiration of Meta’s lease at 770 Broadway for the small decline, but stated that the NYU master lease at the same office building will bring the firm’s office occupancy up to 90.8 percent by January. He also said vacant space at the newly opened Penn 2 has impacted occupancy levels, but that will also only be temporary. “The easiest money we can make is filling up our empties. As occupancy rises, earnings will go up,” he said. “Our office occupancy will likely decrease in the first quarter 2025, and as vacant space at Penn 2 is placed into service, we anticipate that this decrease will be temporary, and as Penn 2 stabilizes we get to 93 [percent occupancy].” Vornado also announced its portfolio’s retail occupancy rates stand at 78 percent, but Roth argued that excluding Manhattan mall vacancies brings the firm’s retail occupancy closer to 90 percent. “So, actually, we’re pretty well leased in above-the-market occupancies,” he said. “There is strong demand in retail and retail is certainly in much better shape than it was a couple of years ago.” The firm said it carries liquidity of $2.6 billion, with $1 billion cash on its balance sheet. “We are in a very strong capital position,” said Roth. “Our single focus is in creating value, being financially disciplined, and getting our stock price up to where we think the value is and where it should be. “In order to do that, we need to keep leasing, keep improving our balance sheet, and cutting out assets we don’t want, turning them into cash, and continue to work on the very significant and great asset pool we currently have,” he added. “But, actually, I’m all about the stock price.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Title: British Pension Fund Joins Bitcoin Rush, Invests 3% Of Its Total Assets In BTC

In a major adoption boost for Bitcoin, a United Kingdom-based pension fund has added the bellwether crypto to its balance sheet — marking the first move of its kind in the nation. According to pension advisory firm Cartwright, the undisclosed fund made a 3% allocation to the apex cryptocurrency. Pensions specialist Cartwright announced Monday that it had successfully guided an unnamed client in the UK to make a considerable investment into Bitcoin. In October, the client in question allocated 3% of its £50 million ($65 million) to BTC after “lengthy consultations with the scheme’s trustees, where ESG, investment case, and security were all addressed at length,” Glenn Cameron, head of digital assets at Cartwright told Corporate Advisor. What makes this investment particularly noteworthy is that the pension fund is actually investing in Bitcoin itself rather than a proxy such as a spot BTC ETF. The report reveals that the private key is divided between five separate institutions. Cartwright said it had made the recommendation owing to Bitcoin’s long-term returns. According to CoinGecko data, the top crypto has soared by almost 100,000% since 2013. According to Sam Roberts, the firm’s director of investment consulting, Bitcoin is well suited to the scheme’s 10-year investment horizon. “Trustees are increasingly looking for innovative solutions to future-proof their schemes in the face of economic challenges,” Roberts posited. This Bitcoin allocation is a strategic move that not only offers diversification but also taps into an asset class with a unique asymmetric risk-return profile.” Roberts further said he hoped the “strategic move” would be emulated by others. “We are proud to have led this groundbreaking move,” he declared, “which we hope will be the start of a trend for institutional investors in the UK to catch up with their increasing number of peers and competitors around the world who are already taking advantage of Bitcoin’s unique attributes.” Cartwright further stated that it anticipates institutional Bitcoin adoption to be similar to when pension schemes started purchasing equities in the 1970s. It might be painfully slow at first, but then, ultimately, it would become a bad idea not to allocate the asset to a portfolio. Cameron also believes that Bitcoin’s unique asymmetric return profile indicates that even a small allocation can considerably improve financial performance. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin has skyrocketed across the globe, specifically in the United States, following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s historic greenlighting of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. These novel investment vehicles allow traditional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency through stock-like shares on regulated exchanges without the hassle of storing the asset. The funds were introduced by Wall Street giants, including BlackRock and Fidelity, and have so far collectively accumulated over 1 million BTC — fast closing in on Satoshi Nakamoto’s stack.

Title: Michigan Becomes First State Pension Fund To Invest In Ethereum ETFs With $10 Million Buy

The State of Michigan Retirement System has disclosed a new holding in Grayscale’s Ethereum exchange-traded fund, becoming the first public pension fund to do so since the ETH-based product commenced trading on U.S. exchanges in July. This strategic move marks a huge step for institutional investment in crypto assets, as the Michigan Retirement System manages roughly $13.6 billion in pension fund assets for state employees. In a 13-F disclosure filed Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Michigan’s pension fund revealed it has scooped up 460,000 shares in Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), valued at approximately $10.07 million, along with an additional 1.1 million worth of shares in the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH). According to VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, Michigan has now become one of the top five holders of Grayscale’s ETH and ETHE. What’s more interesting is that the Michigan pension fund now owns more Ether than Bitcoin, despite the latter being greenlighted by the securities regulator several months in advance. The move sets Michigan apart as most state pension funds focus mostly on Bitcoin investments. As revealed in its latest SEC filing, the Michigan pension fund continues to hold its Bitcoin investment with 110,000 shares in the ARK 21Shares BTC ETF, worth roughly $7 million. “Not only did Michigan’s pension buy ether ETFs, but they bought more than they did of Bitcoin ETFs, $10 million vs $7 million, this despite BTC being up a ton and ether in the gutter,” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posited in a post on X. “Pretty big win for ether, which could use one.” Following the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, institutional investors have become more comfortable with dipping their toes into the fast-growing asset class. In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board made a trailblazing move by picking up a $100 million investment in the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund issued by investment giant BlackRock. Notably, Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis recently sent a letter requesting a report on considering Bitcoin and other digital assets as viable investments for state pension funds. This move signals that more and more states are now eyeing crypto as a viable investment for pension funds.

The company unveiled the new drone, called the MK30, in November 2022. It said then that the MK30, in addition to the other changes, would fly through light rain and have twice the range of earlier models. Amazon said the Federal Aviation Administration's approval includes permission to fly the MK30 over longer distances and beyond the visual line of sight of pilots. The agency granted a similar waiver for Amazon's Prime Air program in May, though that was limited to flights in College Station, Texas, one of the cities where it has been conducting tests. Alongside the FAA approval, Matt McCardle, head of regulatory affairs for Prime Air, said the company is starting to make drone deliveries Tuesday near Phoenix, Arizona. In April, Amazon said it planned to spin up drone operations in Tolleson, a city west of Phoenix, after it shut down an earlier test site in Lockeford, California. The company will dispatch the drones near one of its warehouses in Tolleson as it looks to integrate Prime Air more closely into its existing logistics network and further speed up deliveries. An FAA spokesperson said the agency granted Amazon permission to conduct beyond visual line of sight deliveries in Tolleson on Oct. 31. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos first unveiled plans for the ambitious service more than a decade ago, remarking at the time that the program could be up and running within five years. Despite Amazon investing billions of dollars into the program, progress has been slow. Prime Air encountered regulatory hurdles, missed deadlines and had layoffs last year, coinciding with widespread cost-cutting efforts by CEO Andy Jassy. The program also lost some key executives, including its primary liaison with the FAA and its founding leader. Amazon hired former Boeing executive David Carbon to run the operation. It has also encountered pushback from some residents in the cities where it is trialing drone deliveries. Residents in College Station complained about the noise levels enough that it prompted the city's mayor to mention the concerns in a letter to the FAA, CNBC previously reported. In response, Amazon executives told residents the company would identify a new drone delivery launch site by October 2025. Amazon is not the only company trying to crack delivery by drone. It is competing with Wing, owned by Google parent Alphabet; UPS; Walmart; and a host of startups including Zipline and Matternet.

Title: Exploring The Career Path From IRO To CFO

Plus: Why Controlling Leases Is Important, Boeing Union Ends Strike, Federal Reserve Has New Economic Data For Rate Decision, Nvidia Becomes Most Valuable Company People are often businesses’ largest expense, but leases—for offices, facilities, equipment and vehicles—are usually not that far behind. According to a recent study from lease management platform Visual Lease, 100% of CFOs are concerned about managing those expenses. Not paying enough attention to leases can weigh down a company’s bottom line, either saddling it with rent and utility payments for facilities it doesn’t need, or not negotiating for lower prices or better deals. CFOs are not very confident in their lease figures, according to the study. It found that just 22% felt good about them—more than the 12% of corporate leaders hired to deal with just real estate and leases. And the study found that just under half of CFOs—48%—rely on old-fashioned manual tracking methods for keeping up with lease agreements. CFOs should prioritize better management of their lease portfolio, which could lead to better reporting and money management. More than half—52%—say sustainability metrics represent the biggest challenge with lease portfolios. As companies are beginning to report on ESG, an easy-to-quantify start is looking at the electricity and water consumption at their facilities, as well as waste management. But almost as many CFOs—49%—are concerned that disorganized lease data will get in the way of making a quick change to respond to new circumstances or opportunities. A closer handle on these agreements can help companies know more about their sustainability metrics and use their money more efficiently. For publicly traded companies, the investor relations staff is an important interface between the company and its relationship with shareholders. Sometimes, those roles are filled by the communications team, but when the team is made up of financial professionals, they have a unique view of the company and what makes it valuable. Michaella Gallina is the VP of IR at H&R Block and the CFO of its affiliated company Wave HQ, and she talked to me about the IRO to CFO career path. A portion of our conversation is later in this newsletter. Pro-union stickers on a pole outside the Boeing Renton Production Facility. After a seven-week strike, factory workers at Boeing accepted the company’s revised contract offer, with 59% of members approving it Monday night. The approximately 33,000 workers will return to their Pacific Northwest jobs within the next week. The new contract gives workers a 38% raise over four years and a combined cash bonus of $12,000—$7,000 as a ratification bonus and $5,000 as a 401(k) account contribution. It does not reinstate the company’s former pension plan. Ending the strike helps Boeing begin to stem financial losses—and could put it on a solid path to turn around after an extremely difficult year. The strike began just over a month after CEO Kelly Ortberg took the helm of the company, which in 2024, had major issues with safety, a plea agreement and settlement for fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, and another labor dispute with its onsite firefighters. It’s unclear how the contract impacts Boeing’s financial picture. Last week, Anderson Economic Group estimated total losses from Boeing’s strike at $9.66 billion, with the aerospace company itself losing $5.5 billion. Quarterly earnings for Boeing were solidly in the red when presented last week, and Ortberg already announced layoffs for 10% of the company. In a statement on Monday, Ortberg said, “There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.” A gold plated seal at the Federal Reserve's building in Washington, D.C. After tough years of runaway inflation, the rate has finally deflated to a level the Federal Reserve sees as normal. According to figures released by the Commerce Department last week, inflation was 2.1% last month, meeting economists’ estimates and bringing inflation to the lowest level since February 2021. Core inflation, which excludes more volatile energy and food costs, was a bit higher—2.7%, above analyst estimates of 2.6%. However, these numbers are likely an accurate data point, unlike employment figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. According to the data, the U.S. added just 12,000 jobs last month, far fewer than expected. However, the rate was skewed by work stoppages caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, as well as the strike of more than 30,000 West Coast Boeing plant workers. The unemployment rate is still 4.1%, unchanged from September and in line with economists’ predictions. The gross domestic product for the third quarter was also down a bit, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. GDP grew at 2.8%, slightly less than economists’ estimate of 3%. However, consumer spending grew at a 3.7% clip, leading analysts to tell the New York Times that the economy is healthy and firing on all cylinders. While these numbers are always significant, they take on outsized importance this week. Not only could they influence who voters choose in Tuesday’s election, but they’re likely to be at the center of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting later this week. The policymaking committee may use the information to lower interest rates. According to CME FedWatch, 95.3% of economists currently expect a 0.25% rate cut from this week’s meeting, while 4.7% expect no change. Forbes contributor Jason Schenker writes that the weak job report makes the rate cut highly likely. Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara, California. While many of the biggest tech companies reported quarterly earnings last week, the most consequential move came from Nvidia, which isn’t scheduled to release its report until the end of the month. On Monday morning, Nvidia surpassed Apple as the most valuable public company, with a $3.39 trillion market cap. By Monday afternoon, Apple regained the top spot, but Nvidia overtook it again by Tuesday morning. The Friday announcement that Nvidia will replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average boosted its stock, and Apple saw its value fall as Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a major sale of the company’s stock. Apple reported its earnings after markets closed on Thursday, receiving a tepid response from investors. The tech company exceeded expectations, reporting an all-time high of $94.9 billion in sales—estimates were $94.5 billion—and $46.2 billion in iPhone sales—$1 billion over estimates. But share prices fell as the company revealed its net income declined 36% based on an EU ruling about a tax issue, and Chinese sales missed expectations. In other earnings last week, e-commerce behemoth Amazon reported $158.9 billion in net sales in its last quarter—an 11% increase from a year before. Online store and third-party seller services brought in the bulk of the revenues, but its AWS service platform represented the third largest chunk, with nearly $27.5 billion in sales, representing 19% year-over-year growth. Amazon’s stock rallied on its earnings report, boosting founder Jeff Bezos to be the world’s second richest person, behind Elon Musk. Microsoft reported its best-ever quarter in the tech company’s history, smashing expectations—making $24.7 billion net income, over $23.2 billion predicted by analysts and 11% up year-over-year. One of the biggest growth drivers was Microsoft Cloud, which saw $38.9 billion of total revenue, up 22% from a year ago. But by late Thursday morning, Microsoft’s stock was down more than 4%, with investors likely unsatisfied with the company’s revenue guidance for the next quarter. Its stock has not measurably picked up since. Microsoft said that some suppliers are behind schedule, which impacts its outlook, but CEO Satya Nadella expects the supply and demand to match up within the second half of the fiscal year. H&R Block VP of Investor Relations and Wave HQ CFO Michaella Gallina. Investor relations officers play an essential role at publicly traded companies, and some companies are beginning to value their expertise in the company’s worth and value as knowledge that can help make financial decisions. Michaella Gallina has been vice president of investor relations at H&R Block for three and a half years, and she’s also been CFO of Wave HQ—owned by H&R Block but independently operated—for six months. I talked to her about her career path and why IROs can be good CFOs. This conversation has been edited for length, continuity and clarity. What do people who are IROs and have worked their way up through the IR side bring to the CFO role that others do not? Gallina: Being an IRO teaches you how to be a steward of value. When you’re an IRO, you understand how your company is valued and why the market gives it the multiple. Your job is to increase the multiple of the stock and communicate that story in a credible way. As A CFO, you have to leverage that knowledge because you have to drive value creation when you’re in the execution seat through both the multiple and business results. And if you understand the multiple and what will get you a premium multiple, you can prioritize your organization’s workflow to those value creation streams. That’s not just in the finance organization. The effective CFO is a strategic thought leader. They can say, ‘Our company is valued in these ways. How can I help the organization align our strategy?’ and, of course, understand the financial implications. Secondly, building trust with teams and stakeholders. The IRO’s most trusted credential is their relationships and trust with their constituents: the sell-side analysts that cover them, their buy-side investors, current and prospective shareholders, as well as their management team. As a CFO, you have to understand how critical trust is across the external and internal groups. If you’ve only had internal relationships, you don’t really understand how important those external relationships are. Another area is managing and messaging in times of crisis. An IR professional adds the most significant amount of value in times of crisis because the relationships they’ve built give credibility to their message of whatever they’re doing about that crisis. It makes the other side believe them versus going, ‘Yeah, nice story, but I’m not really sure.’ Delivering a clear and actual message during this time is one lesson you learn. That’s a big thing to the CFO internally: Keep panic from spreading and get your teams focused on their jobs. What goes along with that is in both roles, you need to be unflappable. You are the spearhead of the whole organization when something goes wrong. You don’t need to go, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m panicking. This is a crisis. Get everybody spun up.’ You need to go, ‘Okay, this happened. Let’s get to work. What are we going to do?’ As an IRO, you do that because you have to tell a story of what the company is doing to calm investors. As the CFO, you have to figure out the action plan, and the bigger piece is you have to make sure [it] will satisfy investors. You might have an action plan, but if you don’t know the Street, and you don’t know the market and how they view you, it might not be aligned. And they might go, ‘That’s what you think you need to do, but it won’t help.’ Or, ‘We don’t buy into it.’ There’s really a chain reaction on that front. On the flip side, is there anything that an IRO does not get in their job that somebody taking a more traditional path to CFO would do? The most effective IROs need to have broader experience within the finance organization. If you come from being a corporate communications professional, you don’t understand valuation. There is a gap in that space right now of those two types of professionals, and you have to teach yourself that. There are lots of Training The Street classes that first-year investment banking analysts take. Overall, one wonderful piece you get as an IRO versus any other finance function is the complete view of the organization, how it works together and how that drives value. If you’re in FP&A, you probably don't understand a multiple valuation because you’re just looking through the P&L, or you might not understand how a ratio you’re calculating is interpreted differently by the buy side than the corporate lens. What advice would you give to somebody working on the IR side interested in eventually being a CFO? Get all the experience you can in every corporate finance role. The bottom line is that experience across the organization and finance makes you a better IRO, first and foremost. The more experience you have, the better story you can tell, and the more prepared you can be to take over the leadership in driving value creation at the company. Secondly, if you don’t have analyst experience, you need to seek that externally [to] help you understand very detailed modeling and valuation across the board.

Title: Nvidia and Apple keep taking turns at the top of the world

Nvidia (NVDA+2.24%) is back on top as the world’s most valuable public company ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The chipmaker’s shares rose around 2.4% on Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.42 trillion and past Apple’s (AAPL+2.21%) market cap of $3.37 trillion. The iPhone maker’s shares were up by around 0.4%. Apple was able to defend the top spot at the market close on Monday after Nvidia briefly took over earlier in the day. In late October, Nvidia briefly overtook Apple after a record-setting stock rally, but ended the day below the tech giant. Nvidia will take over Intel’s spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the end of the week. Nvidia passed both Apple and Microsoft (MSFT+1.30%) for the first time in June to become the most valuable public company in the world. Earlier in the month, the chipmaker reached the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. It became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after it reported record fourth-quarter earnings in February. Nvidia’s South Korea-based chipmaking partner SK Hynix saw its shares surge on Monday after it said the U.S.-based chipmaker asked it to move supply of its next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips up by six months. The U.S. presidential election could have implications for Nvidia and other chipmakers which have come under tightening U.S. restrictions on selling to China under both the Trump and Biden administrations. In October, the head of Dutch chipmaking equipment company ASML (ASML+2.40%) said he expects more pressure on U.S. allies to curb chip sales to China. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML, said. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” The U.S. finalized restrictions on investments in sensitive technologies in China by U.S. individuals and companies late last month. The rules cover three categories of technology: semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Some investments are banned, while others require notice to the U.S. government.

Group plans to buy company behind Conlons & Sons in Co Kildare Frank Keane also operates Volkswagen dealerships in Dublin Frank Keane Motors plans to buy company behind Co Kildare BMW dealership BMW. Photo: Getty Frank Keane Motors – a BMW dealership for almost 60 years – is planning to buy Conlons & Sons in Co Kildare in a deal that’s likely to be worth well in excess of €20m. If approved by the competition watchdog, it will create a group with turnover easily exceeding €300m a year. Frank Keane Motors has just notified the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) that it intends to buy the entire issued share capital of Pavla Unlimited in Naas. Both companies sell new and used cars and are BMW dealerships, with Conlon & Sons selling the eponymous marque as well as Mini, Jaguar and Land Rover. Frank Keane Motors also sells Volkswagen vehicles and light commercial vehicles. It is also a wholesale distributor of FUSO trucks and MG passenger cars. Today's News in 90 Seconds - November 6th Recent company filings for Pavla – controlled by Ray and Nicholas Conlon - show that last month it issued shares valued at almost €23m to a company called Bonaghmore Holdings. Pavla was only incorporated during the summer. Bonaghmore Holdings is in turn owned by a company called Gledstanes, which was also set up during the summer. The most recent set of publicly available accounts for Bonaghmore Holdings show that it generated sales of €84.8m in the 12 months to the end of August 2023, up from €71.4m a year earlier. The company made a €6.1m pre-tax profit in the 2023 financial year, which compared with almost €6.9m in the previous year. It had shareholder funds of €41.5m at the end of the 2023 financial year. Frank Keane Group is unlimited and does not have to file publicly available accounts. However, its turnover is likely to be north of €250m a year. Founded in 1967, it was awarded the BMW franchise for Ireland that year. It now employs about 300 people. It operates a BMW dealership on the Naas Road in Dublin as well as one on Blackrock in the capital’s southside. It also has a Mini dealership on the Nass Road. The firm has two Volkswagen dealerships, both of which are in Dublin. The CCPC said submissions from third parties in relation to the proposed acquisition of Pavla Unlimited are due by December 13 as part of its preliminary investigation in the deal.

Title: Hims & Hers will start selling a generic weight loss drug
URL: https://qz.com/hims-hers-liraglutide-glp1-weight-loss-ozempic-1851689645
Time Published: 2024-11-05T15:50:55Z
Full Content:
The millennial-skewed telehealth platform Hims & Hers (HIMS+0.96%) announced Monday that it will start offering customers a generic version of liraglutide, an older GLP-1 weight loss drug, next year. The news comes as some patients still struggle to fill prescriptions of the most advanced branded GLP-1 treatments on the market like Zepbound, Wegovy and Ozempic. Hims CEO Andrew Dudum told investors during a call on Monday that company as already “confirmed a core supplier” for its new offering. Liraglutide is currently sold under the brand name Saxenda by Novo Nordisk (NVO+2.18%) and many of its patents have already expired. In a 56-week-long clinical trial, the once-daily injection helped most patients lose over 5% of their weight. For comparison, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY+2.79%) weekly-injectable Zepbound lost over 20% of their weight after 72 weeks during a clinical trial. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. Newer versions of these treatments, like Wegovy and Ozempic, have become highly sought after because of their effectiveness at treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have had difficulty getting their hands on these popular medications. When a medication is in shortage, which Eli Lilly’s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy have been for most of the year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows pharmacies to make compounded, or altered, versions of the drug if they meet specific regulatory requirements. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight loss drugs during recent shortages. A generic liraglutide offering will provide Hims customers more options as these shortages start to end. The company started selling compounded weight loss drugs this year. Earlier this month, the FDA marked the shortage of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, as resolved. Eli Lilly quickly started sending cease-and-desist letters to companies selling copycat versions. In response, the Outsourcing Facilities Association filed a lawsuit in Texas against the FDA, challenging its decision to remove tirzepatide from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, obtained by Ars Technica, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” In a court filing, the FDA said pharmacists could resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list. The FDA also recently updated its drug shortage database to show that the all doses of Novo Nordisk’s weight loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic are now available. However, the drugs continue to be considered in shortage for now as the agency and Novo Nordisk work to ensure a steady supply. Hims chief financial officer Yemi Okupe told Yahoo Finance that company is hearing from customers that they are still finding it difficult to find branded GLP-1s on pharmacy shelves. “In our view, we do still see that the medications are on shortage,” Okupe said. “What consumers are telling us resoundingly is that they are struggling to get access to name-brand GLP-1 medications over the last two months.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Investor Anthony Pompliano Calls Bitcoin ‘Gold With Wings,’ Says BTC the Savings Account of the New Generation

Longtime crypto bull Anthony Pompliano believes that the flagship digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) is gold on steroids. In a new interview on Fox Business, the founder of venture capital firm Pomp Investments says that the debasement of the US dollar is bullish for both Bitcoin and gold, but the flagship crypto asset could outperform the precious metal due to increasing adoption. “If you look at gold and the S&P 500 over the last five years, the compound annual growth rate is about the same. Gold is up 13% and the S&P is up 14%. Bitcoin has destroyed that. And so I like to say that Bitcoin is gold with wings. Bitcoin and gold both go up for the same reason. They’re debasing the dollar. But Bitcoin is much more sensitive. It’s an earlier asset that the world is trying to price in. What’s very unique about Bitcoin is that it’s a bottom-up story. Most technology goes top-down. Militaries and governments, they adopt it first, then corporations and then finally individuals. They get a smartphone or they get a computer on their desk. They’re the last ones. Bitcoin was the opposite. The individuals got it first. Now we’re seeing corporations and financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity start to adopt this. Eventually, it’s going to be central banks and it is going to be governments. Central banks today own 12% of the global gold supply. I believe that they will eventually start to buy Bitcoin. That would be very bullish for the price of Bitcoin.” He also believes that people will increasingly store their wealth in stablecoins and Bitcoin instead of a traditional bank account. “If you think of the traditional financial system, you have a checking account, you got a savings account. That checking account is being replaced by stablecoins. It’s just dollars in a digital rail. Bitcoin is becoming that savings account and the beauty of a savings account is you put your money there and you don’t move it. So if you go and you look on-chain, you can see that more than one out of every two Bitcoin has not moved in the last two years, and two out of every three Bitcoin has not moved in the last 12 months even though Bitcoin’s price has tripled during that time period.” Bitcoin is trading for $67,694 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

Title: Amazon begins delivering certain products via drone in Phoenix | TechCrunch

Starting today, Amazon customers in the West Valley Phoenix Metro Area have access to a drone-deliverable selection from Amazon’s catalog, including household, beauty, office, health, and tech supplies. Products must weigh five pounds or less to be eligible; Amazon says about 50,000 are available at launch. Customers can choose the drone delivery location for their address before they check out. Most can expect to receive items in an hour max, according to Amazon, delivered direct from the take-off site in Tolleson. An Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch that drone delivery will be available during the daylight hours and “favorable” weather conditions. “Currently we do not offer drone delivery at night, during heavy winds, or during heavy rain,” they added. “Customers in designated delivery area within a radius of our site can get a drone delivery … We’ll inform customers when drone delivery is live in their area.” Amazon’s using its latest drone for deliveries, the MK30, which was recently approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to fly beyond the visual line of sight of drone operators. Amazon claims the MK30 can fly twice as far as its previous drone, is about 50% quieter to the human ear, and is built to fly in rainy weather. Amazon has also started to deploy the MK30 to make deliveries in College Station, Texas, where the company has been testing drone-based prescription medicine deliveries since 2023. Amazon’s drone delivery efforts have faced a number of setbacks, from complaints over noise to regulatory hurdles and layoffs. Widespread cost-cutting efforts by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have also stymied the service’s progress. To set the stage for easier — and presumably less expensive — deployments, Amazon says it’s now integrating its drone systems into its same-day delivery network instead of building standalone facilities. Amazon previously said that it would bring its drone delivery offerings to the U.K. and Italy by the end of 2024. The company gave no update on those plans today.

Title: Grindr accused of using return-to-office policy to thwart unionization and push workers out

83 workers were fired by Grindr When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has filed a formal complaint against LGBTQ dating app Grinder over its enforcement of a return-to-office policy, which it alleges was only enacted to retaliate against the formation of a workers’ union. According to the report, Grindr terminated the contracts of “about 83 employees” after they failed to comply with the new RTO mandate. However, the workers were allegedly only given two weeks to relocate to a designated hub city or resign. The NLRB’s investigation was triggered by six unfair labor practice charges filed in August, representing workers in California, Nevada and Hawaii. Grindr’s relocation requirements were notably challenging for many workers given the short notice period. Trans employees were among the most affected, being that many faced struggles to locate alternative healthcare in sufficient time. The dating app denies the accusations, describing them as “meritless” and arguing that the union activity only emerged after the company announced its RTO policy. The union added: “In response, Grindr management hired notorious union-busting Littler Mendelson and quickly established a retaliatory return-to-office (RTO) policy.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! More broadly, Grindr’s efforts to get workers back into the office reflects an industry-wide trend in the tech sector. Companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft have all reduced the amount of time that workers have at home, but criticism always arises accusing companies of using these policies to encourage resignations and reduce the need for layoffs. If Grindr can’t come to an agreement, the case will be heard by an administrative law judge in March 2025. The union, Grindr United-CWA, commented: “Today’s complaint from the NLRB is another huge victory for our union.” Grindr did not immediately respond to TechRadar Pro’s request for a comment.

Title: University A.I. Programs See Massive Enrollment Surges Thanks to ChatGPT

Time Published: 2024-11-05T13:00:58Z

In 2018, the University at Buffalo became one of the first schools in the world to establish a master’s program focused on A.I. The technology “wasn’t a big craze” at the time, Kemper Lewis, dean of the university’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, told Observer, with the program’s enrollment seen as “slow and steady for a little while.” Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The program is classified as a Master of Science in Engineering Science with a focus on A.I. and provides a foundational background in A.I. and relevant subsets like machine learning, deep learning and advanced artificial neural networks. The degree opened for enrollment in the spring of 2020 and counted five students in its inaugural semester. That number has since risen more than twentyfold, with the university counting 103 students in the program this fall. “It was a great investment now that we look back on it,” said Lewis. A portion of this surge can be attributed to the mainstream breakthrough of A.I. following the November 2022 launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, said Lewis, who noted a “decent jump” in enrollment in connection to the chatbot’s release. But the program’s more significant surges occurred in relation to local initiatives like Empire A.I., a $400 million statewide research consortium unveiled by New York Governor Kathy Hochul earlier this year. The University at Buffalo is part of the new public-private research center and plans to build an A.I. supercomputing center on campus valued at $250 million. “I think there’s a lot of Google searches going on right now about A.I. degrees, Buffalo, and they’re finding our master’s program from all over the world,” said Lewis. The University at Buffalo isn’t the only school embracing A.I. into its degree programs. Schools like Carnegie Mellon, Purdue University and MIT were also early adopters, while the University of Pennsylvania earlier this year made history as the first Ivy League school to offer an undergraduate degree and a subsequent master’s in A.I. Carnegie Mellon, which established its A.I. undergraduate degree in 2018, has also seen a rise in interest. While its 2019 enrollment totaled 53, the program has reliably counted more than 100 students annually since 2021. Oregon State University’s graduate A.I. program grew from 15 students in its inaugural 2021 class to 62 last fall, and MIT’s A.I.-related undergraduate major counted 300 students this year compared to just 37 in 2022. A.I.-related undergraduate and master’s degree conferrals have risen by 120 percent since 2011, according to a 2023 report from Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, while A.I.-related Ph.D. conferrals have increased by 33 percent during that time. At the University at Buffalo, the school’s A.I. degree takes between 12 to 18 months to complete and has sent off alumni to companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon Web Services and Salesforce. The school is in the process of bolstering the program through initiatives like Advancing Top 25: Faculty Hiring, which has helped add more than 200 faculty members researching A.I. Such research is needed as the program’s subject matter continues to shift, according to Lewis. “We’re constantly working on improving the degree and making sure it continues to be relevant,” he said. Lewis added that its efforts are starting to pay off as people grasp the relevance of A.I. and begin perceiving it as a valuable sector in higher education. “I think students around the world are starting to realize, okay, this is here to stay,” he said.

Title: What's Happening With Google Stock?

Google logo sign is seen outiside Google office in Krakow, Poland on October 19th, 2024. (Photo by ... [+] Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) saw a marginal growth of over 1% last week, despite it reporting a solid quarter. The company reported revenue of $88.3 billion and earnings of $2.12 per share, both metrics well above the consensus estimates of $86.3 billion and $1.85, respectively. The increased demand for AI solutions drove the growth for the company. However, much of the positives appears to be priced in for its stock. In this note, we discuss the key takeaways from Alphabet’s results, its stock performance, and valuation. Also, check out should you Buy, Sell, Or Hold Amazon? Google’s revenues of $88.3 billion in Q3 reflected a 15% y-o-y gain. The growth was led by its cloud business, with segment sales up a solid 35% to $11.4 billion. Google search revenue was up 12% to $49.4 billion, and YouTube ad revenue was also up 12% to $8.9 billion y-o-y. The company’s self-driving car unit — Waymo — is now seeing 150,000 weekly paid rides. Waymo could be the next big thing for Google. See how Waymo could be worth $5 trillion. Not only did Alphabet see its revenue rise, its operating margin expanded 450 bps y-o-y to 32.3% in Q3. Higher revenue and margin expansion led to a 37% rise in the bottom line to $2.12 per share. Looking forward, we expect the company to post revenue of $96 billion in Q4, and earnings to be around $2.15 per share. While Alphabet’s results were solid, its stock price appears to have little room for growth, in our view. We estimate Google’s valuation to be $182 per share, reflecting only 6% upside from its current levels of over $170. Our forecast is based on 23x expected earnings of $8.05 per share in 2024. The 23x figure is higher than the stock average P/E ratio of 18x seen over the last three years. GOOG stock is trading at a multiple lower than some of its peers, with META trading at 26x and AMZN at 40x forward expected earnings. That is because there remains a key risk for Alphabet. Google is facing antitrust cases, alleging the company to monopolize the marketplace and the general search services. The remedies could include a breakup of the company, which seems unlikely for now, regulatory oversight, and restrictions on businesses, among others. None of these would bode well for Alphabet’s businesses in the long term. As such, despite a strong growth visibility in the cloud business, on the back of AI demand, and continued ad revenue gains, we think that the stock may not see any meaningful growth in the near term. GOOG stock has seen over 20% gains this year, broadly aligning with the returns for the S&P500 index. However, the change in GOOG stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for GOOG stock were 65% in 2021, -39% in 2022, and 59% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While GOOG stock looks like it has little room for growth, it is helpful to see how Google’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons. Separately, look at what’s happening with META stock.

Title: Will Wall Street allow Big Tech to make AI work?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over – at least when it comes to the stock market and investors. In the past few months, we have seen the value of chip companies that have positioned themselves in the AI sector soar. Nvidia has overtaken Intel, a situation that might once have been unthinkable. Newcomers such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been making inroads into the market, attracting significant valuations from investors. And it seems that anyone who is anyone is getting involved in AI in some way. If there was any doubt that AI was attracting big money, a look at the most recent round of quarterly results should have put that to bed. Last week, several of the largest tech companies – Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS – revealed increased spending on the technology as they each try to capitalise on the interest in AI. But there is more to come. Big tech companies are planning to spend even more in building their AI arsenal into next year, and hoping to persuade customers to adopt it at scale. The question is, will Wall Street give them the space to do it? Lest we forget, it is not too long ago that the same companies that are investing heavily in their AI capabilities were telling their staff that they needed to cut their cloth to fit the new economic reality, at the mercy of fluctuating share price. That new economic reality seems to include the shiny new AI toys, for which tech companies seem prepared to offer deep budgets. If the promise of AI is realised, then the billions ploughed into developing the technology will be seen as a sensible investment. But if not, it won’t be the first time that a much-hyped new technology fails to live up to the forecasts. Fully autonomous cars, which have been in development for years, have yet to reach any sort of meaningful market. NFTs promising a new wave of artists revenue, selling for outrageous sums, have fallen out of favour. And lets not forget the world of crypto. For now, Wall Street is watching, nervously. If there is a hint of the technology not reaching its potential, the money that has flowed in to AI companies could just as quickly flow out.

Most Widely Read Newspaper Kindly share this story: The presale of DTX Exchange is capturing market interest as it has managed to raise just over $6.5 million and plans to integrate DEX and CEX elements within its independent Layer-1 blockchain. Providing up to 1000x more liquidity than most existing cryptocurrencies, DTX is designed to facilitate both crypto and traditional financial operations, without the need for additional blockchains. According to analysts, listing the Binance would significantly have an impact on the price of DTX through the roof as a 1 ETH investment opportunity. However, BTC and ETH have painted a bullish picture if key support levels are intact, such as what we see Bitcoin is currently trading below the realized price and ETH is good for a short-term up move. Bitcoin Struggles Below Realized Price, Testing Market Support It is currently priced at $68,608 below the realized price of $69,352 thus slowing down the chances of a bounce back to $72,000. Hitherto, prices tested below the realized price imply that the amount of selling pressures is bearish, therefore depressing the market.

Key Highlights -Impact on India Pharmaceuticals: Indian generic drug exports to the US may face tariff revisions, potentially affecting the pharmaceutical sector. IT Sector: A slowdown in US discretionary spending due to trade wars could negatively impact India’s IT exports. FPIs: If US interest rate cuts are delayed, FPI inflows into India could diminish, as there is an inverse relationship between US interest rates and FPI flows into emerging markets. India’s Monetary Policy: Any delay in US rate cuts could also delay India’s repo rate cuts, prolonging pressures on the Indian economy, which is already seeing a slowdown in earnings growth. “A Trump victory should ideally flag off the next leg of US market dominance over the global markets. It would also contribute to an accompanying rise in bond market yields, particularly the 10-year Treasury. A stronger US bond yield would exacerbate the capital outflows from the Indian markets triggering another cruel spell of drawdowns. Additionally, we could see a pronounced comeback of the protectionist tendencies, which we first glimpsed in Trump’s last stint as the US President. Between 2017 and 2020, the denial rate of H-1B visas ramped up putting IT companies in a fix. With Trump coming to power, there could be employee and workflow disruptions leading to transitory, minor dents in the top lines of IT companies. However, the symbolic posturing behind the move will be sobering for a country like India, with a massive workforce looking to market their skill overseas. If the democratic nominee Kamala Harris comes to power, it would be a non-factor, essentially an extension of the policies of the incumbent President Joe Biden.” Bank Nifty opened today’s session with a gap-down at 51,053 versus yesterday’s close of 51,215.

Additionally, when comparing growth rates with December 2023, deposit growth has continued to outpace credit offtake. Credit offtake increased by 8.0% compared to December 2023, reaching Rs 172.4 lakh crores as of October 18, 2024. Mortgages and MSMEs account for the bulk of this increase. However, the growth slowdown compared to last year can be attributed to a higher base effect due to the merger and RBI measures such as higher risk weights and the proposed LCR norms. Deposits rose at 8.6% compared to December 2023, reaching Rs 218.1 lakh crore as of October 18, 2024. This growth can be attributed to rising term deposit rates of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs).

Read more In response to the SEBI directive on Monday ordering the suspension of Aravind Maiya as CEO of Embassy Office Parks REIT in connection with an earlier involvement as an auditor to Coffee Day Enterprises and found guilty of misconduct, Embassy REIT said in an exchange filing - “While we are reviewing the order and evaluating all options, in compliance with SEBI’s directive, effective immediately, Aravind Maiya will be stepping down as CEO of Embassy REIT. He will assume the role of Head of Strategy for Embassy REIT. The REIT’s board, and the management team will oversee all its operations and capital allocation to ensure that normal business is not compromised in any manner whatsoever, while evaluating the most appropriate approach for the interim CEO position.” The statement added that Embassy REIT was the foundation of the REIT asset class in India. “The REIT’s strong management team in place, will continue to be focused on delivering exceptional results, as evidenced by REIT’s recent H1 2025 performance. The business is in great shape and the REIT’s stock performance is a reflection of the strong fundamentals in the sector.

The Global Methane pledge was adopted in COP26 and countries that were part of the pledge agreed to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. A number of National Oil companies globally have joined the OGMP 2.0 framework and are also part of the Oil and Gas Climate initiative. Cairn’s entry into this very elite club of companies which have adopted the OGMP framework will mean regular (annual) reporting on emissions and potentially a commitment to reach Level 5 reporting (most rigorous reporting) within a 3-5 year timeframe. This should encourage industry peers in India to also consider adopting the framework and moving towards higher quality of reporting of methane emissions. 👉Net profit up 21.4% at ₹440.5 cr vs ₹363 cr

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks slipped during a jittery session on Monday to kick off a week of potentially huge market-moving events — the presidential election and the Federal Reserve policy decision. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by about the same amount. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, falling about 250 points, or 0.6%. Monday's session was choppy ahead of Tuesday's election, a big risk event for markets. The new president — whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump — will set the course for the economy in the years that follow. The neck-and-neck race has investors bracing for volatility on Election Day itself. Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Weekend polls showed Harris with a shock lead in Iowa and gaining ground elsewhere — a sign the Democrat has a better chance of winning than Wall Street had calculated. The dollar dropped by the most in a month as traders recalculated bets on a Trump victory. Treasury yields also retreated, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) sliding almost 10 basis points to about 4.30%. Also looming large is the Fed's two-day policy meeting, kicking off a day later than usual on Wednesday in light of the election. Wall Street is convinced that Chair Jerome Powell will usher in a 0.25% rate cut on Thursday, despite signs of stubborn inflation and muddied job market signals. Given that, the focus is on what action the Fed might take at future meetings, with the market now seeing three fewer cuts through the end of 2025 than it previously expected. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards In other markets, oil prices jumped nearly 3% after OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, decided to delay a planned hike in output by at least a month and Iran escalated Mideast tensions by warning of a "crushing response" to Israel's strikes. Stocks fell during a choppy trading session on Monday ahead of the US presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down 0.6%, or roughly 270 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed down 0.3% after switching between positive and negative territories throughout the session. Chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) closed slightly higher but off its session high in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow on Friday. "Trump trades" were volatile during the session, with Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) closing out the session 12% higher despite an Iowa poll over the weekend showing his contender, Vice President Kamala Harris, ahead of former president Trump. The markets were choppy on Monday as investors braced for Tuesday's US presidential election. Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson made some predictions on which sectors could lead, depending on the outcome. In a Republican sweep scenario, in which Donald Trump wins and his party maintains control of the House and also gains the Senate, cyclicals such as Financials, Industrials, and commodity-sensitive industries could outperform and take the major averages higher, provided Treasury yields stay somewhat contained in the days following the outcome, Wilson and his team said. "Conversely, if the move higher in yields is more material and is driven by a rising term premium due to fiscal sustainability concerns, we would expect more of a risk-off posture like the summer/fall of 2023," Wilson wrote. If Vice President Kamala Harris wins and Congress is divided, Wilson sees "tariff-exposed consumer equities and renewables outperforming in the short term" while Financials, Industrials and commodity-sensitive industries could underperform initially. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 1% to hover around $67,800 on Monday as investors braced for the US presidential election on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency has been viewed as a beneficiary if Donald Trump were to win the White House. The token moved beyond $72,000 last week, only to retreat after an Iowa poll over the weekend showed Vice President Kamala Harris leapfrogging ahead of Trump. The former president has said in the past he will create a "bitcoin national stockpile" if reelected to the White House. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped into green territory by 1:45 p.m Eastern on Monday in what has shaped up to be a choppy session. The tech-heavy index switched between positive and negative since early morning trading. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was helping lift the major average in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) later this week. The AI chip heavyweight climbed more than 2% during the session. Yahoo Finance's Grace Williams reports: The 2024 presidential election is a day away, and with both candidates polling closely, speculation about a second Trump administration now heavily involves Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Specifically, if Musk will head up Trump’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). If that happens, “I think he will still be heavily involved with [Tesla],” Bank of America senior auto analyst John Murphy told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. Read more here. Energy (XLE) stocks outperformed on Monday as crude futures gained more than 2% following a decision by oil alliance OPEC+ to delay an increase in output. Real Estate (XRE) and Materials (XLB) also rose while Utilities (XLU), Financials (XLF) and Healthcare (XLV) dipped. Stocks moved to session lows by mid-session on Monday, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropping 0.4% after a Wall Street Journal report suggested Russia plotted to send incendiary devices on planes headed to the US and Canada. The report cited Western officials who said the devices that ignited in Europe were part of a plot to put them on cargo or passenger planes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped from positive to negative territory to drop 0.3% immediately following the report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 400 points, or almost 1%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 2.5% Monday as analysts pointed to rising chip sales and mounting spending on AI infrastructure. That jump helped the AI chipmaker reach a $3.40 trillion market cap, according to Yahoo Finance data, again overtaking Apple's (AAPL) roughly $3.35 trillion. Apple shares traded slightly lower midday, down 0.5%. Nvidia had last dethroned Apple a little over a week ago, but Apple briefly retook the crown — before its earnings weighed on the stock. Nvidia's rise comes after a week of ups and downs, as Big Tech's earnings shone a spotlight on AI capital expenditures. Investors fear that spending coud ease in the coming years as infrastructure projects reach completion, weighing on AI chipmakers. Wall Street analysts have largely remained bullish on AI hardware stocks, seeing infrastructure spending by Big Tech continuing to rise. Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill said Monday that they expect Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) to spend a combined $292 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2025, representing an 88% increase from 2023 expenses. Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note Monday that global semiconductor sales grew 7.6% in September — "a bit above typical" — from the prior month. Rasgon said of Nvidia: "The datacenter opportunity is enormous, and still early, with material upside still possible." Peloton (PTON) shares rose 9% on Monday after Bank of America analysts upgraded the stock to a Buy from Neutral amid optimism over the fitness equipment maker's new leadership. "Peloton's new CEO Peter Stern does not have public company CEO experience but meets all the criteria set by Peloton's board" including consumer software and hardware experience and subscription services, the analysts wrote. Stern, an avid Peloton user who comes from Ford (F), will start his CEO role on Jan. 1. Constellation Energy (CEG) stock fell as much as 12% early Monday amid a broader decline in nuclear power stocks following the US government's rejection of another Big Tech nuclear power agreement late Friday. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a proposal from a grid operator, PJM, to ramp up the amount of power supplied through the grid from Talen Energy (TLN) to an Amazon (AMZN) AI data center. Talen said in a statement on Sunday it believes the FERC "erred" in its ruling, adding the company is "evaluating our options, with a focus on commercial solutions." Talen Energy dropped 9% in early trading, while Sam Altman-backed Oklo (OKLO) fell 8%, Centrus Energy (LEU) tumbled 19%, NANO Nuclear (NNE) dropped 10%, Vistra (VST) sank 4%, and NuScale Power (SMR) fell 7%. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Read the full story here. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) fell around 2% in early trading on Monday after initially opening the day in the green. Shares are bracing for another volatile week on Wall Street just one day ahead of the presidential election. The stock suffered its largest percentage decline last week and closed down around 20% to end the five-day period on Friday. And since Tuesday, more than $4 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock still has more than doubled from its September lows. Prior to the recent sell-off, shares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, had risen in recent weeks as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showed Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. That lead, however, narrowed significantly over the weekend as new polling showed Harris surpassing Trump in Iowa, which has historically voted Republican. Read more here. US stocks dipped on Monday as investors braced for this week's US elections and a Federal Reserve policy meeting. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened near the flat line, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped about 50 points. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose more than 1% at the open on news that the artificial intelligence chip heavyweight will enter the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Energy (XLE) stocks also gained on Monday amid surging oil prices. Investors are focused on Tuesday's highly anticipated US presidential election, as well as on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The markets largely anticipate policymakers will cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Affordability concerns are locking more potential first-time homebuyers out of the housing market. A new report showed that first-time homebuyers made up 24% of all buyers this year, marking the lowest share since 1981, according to data from the 2024 National Association of Realtors (NAR) profile of home buyers and sellers. High home prices, elevated borrowing costs, and low inventory have hammered affordability over the past year, leaving many first-time buyers on the fence about purchasing a home. In July, the NAR surveyed over 167,000 recent homebuyers, who said the barriers to entry remained challenging. “In the time frame surveyed, mortgage interest rates jumped to nearly 8%, and housing affordability reduced to historical lows. Home buyers continued to struggle with housing inventory,” NAR’s deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told Yahoo Finance. “At the same time, rental prices were rising and after a student debt pause, borrowers had to resume payments, making it difficult to save for a downpayment,” Lautz added. Mortgage rates have jumped to between 6% to 7% this year — and now average mortgage rates are rising after hitting a two-year low in September. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers may also be bidding against those making all-cash offers. “If a buyer was on solid financial footing to enter the buying market and there were multiple offers, there is a chance they were up against an all-cash offer,” Lautz said. Oil futures jumped more than 2.5% on Monday after OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, announced it would delay unwinding production cuts by a month. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to trade above $71 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $75 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with Russia and other countries, said it would continue with its output cuts for one month until the end of 2024. The decision to delay adding 180,000 million barrels per day starting in December had already been postponed in recent months amid volatile oil prices.

That was the conclusion of the S&P Dow Jones committee, which decides when changes need to be made to the 30-member index, long viewed as a key barometer of the U.S. economy. After markets closed on Friday, S&P said Intel is out. It's being replaced, on Nov. 8, by rival chipmaker Nvidia, which has ballooned to become the world's second most-valuable public company, just a hair behind Apple as of Monday. With the change, four of the tech industry's six trillion-dollar companies will be in the Dow, with internet giants Alphabet and Meta still on the outside. For those two companies, there are no obvious members to replace. Nvidia, on the other hand, recently leapfrogged Intel as the biggest chipmaker by revenue, creating a clear one-for-one swap opportunity. A defining characteristic of the Dow is that it's a price-weighted index. That means a stock's significance is based on its price and not the market cap of the company. In getting trounced by Nvidia in artificial intelligence while also losing share of its core PC and data center processor market, Intel has seen its stock price plummet by more than half this year, closing on Friday at $23.20. Now, Intel is by far the least-significant member of the Dow, with a weighting of less than 0.5%. The next lowest-priced stock is Verizon at around $41. With Intel being the only chipmaker in the index, the sector is underrepresented relative to its position in the economy. "A big part of the decision is that semis weren't being represented," Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in an interview. "Sector representation and price is important." Nvidia's stock works in the company's favor. On a market cap basis, Nvidia would be worth an outsized 18% of the index, but its stock price will give it just the 21st highest weighting, behind Chevron and ahead of 3M. Nvidia positioned itself to join the Dow in May, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Silverblatt said the technology industry's weighting in the Dow will go up to about 19.5% from 18.9%, even though its market weight will be at around 58%. The bigger weighting change comes with Sherwin-Williams joining the index at the same time and replacing Dow Inc., bringing the materials sector to about 5% from less than 1%, Silverblatt said. As for Alphabet and Meta, the wait could continue for a long while. Amazon joined the Dow in January, giving the internet sector greater representation in the index. Alphabet's position is slightly complicated by the fact that its Class A and Class C stocks are both publicly traded. Meta's price of almost $562 would currently give it the heftiest weighting in the Dow, just ahead of UnitedHealth Group. Given tech's heightened overall representation, there are no obvious moves ahead that would include Silicon Valley's megacaps. "In order to put one in, you have to take one out," Silverblatt said. "It's going to be hard to make it the Dow 31." WATCH: Nvidia is leaps and bounds ahead of AMD on AI story Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Securities disclosure over Cambridge Analytica data breach comes before court
URL: https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/11/securities-disclosure-over-cambridge-analytica-data-breach-comes-before-court/
Time Published: 2024-11-04T20:36:19Z
Full Content:
The justices will return to securities law on Wednesday with arguments in a case arising out of the 2015 Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data breach. The tech giant’s effort to fend off federal securities fraud lawsuits in Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank could narrow the opportunities for private investors to hold companies accountable under federal laws that regulate corporate misconduct. In 2016, the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica exploited the data of over 30 million Facebook users in connection with Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. After Facebook (now Meta) knew of the breach, but before Cambridge’s widespread use of the data was made public, Facebook issued a securities filing disclosing to investors the hypothetical risk that a security breach might cause harm to Facebook’s business and stock price. That disclosure did not reveal that, as Facebook was aware, a large breach of that sort already had occurred. Later, when Cambridge’s misuse of the data became widely known, Facebook’s stock price fell precipitously. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Facebook shareholders sued the company for securities fraud, arguing that the disclosures about the risk of a securities breach were misleading because they did not reveal what Facebook knew about the Cambridge breach. A federal district court dismissed their claims, holding that the risk statements were not false or misleading. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed, prompting Facebook to come to the Supreme Court. This is one of those cases – regrettably common – where the parties spend as much of their time bickering about what question is properly before the justices as they do presenting their arguments on the merits. Paring away the contentions about what was and was not argued below and whose position has changed the most over the course of the proceeding, Facebook’s central point is that its disclosure about the hypothetical possibility that a data breach could cause it harm in the future is not misleading, and that the lower court erred in its contrary finding. Specifically, Facebook argues that this kind of disclosure – a forward-looking statement about future risks – should never be regarded as misleading solely because it fails to disclose that the relevant triggering event (in this case, a securities breach) already has occurred and well might cause harm to the company. Here, because nothing in the disclosure was incorrect – it is in fact true that a security breach could harm Facebook and its stock price, as history now teaches us. In short, the company says, Facebook cannot be held liable for what it did not say. The investors reject Facebook’s argument as seeking a categorical rule that gives companies a pass if they make a clearly misleading statement and put it in a forward-looking risk disclosure as opposed to some other part of their filing. From the investors’ perspective, the rule should be the same here as anywhere else; the only relevant question is whether the statement, taken in context, was materially misleading. The only thing that the lower courts held here is that Facebook can be liable if the statement, in context, was materially misleading. The investors, a bank and a public pension plan, are seeking compensation for the lost value of their stock. My guess is that the justices will be frustrated by how little the issues on which the parties discuss in their briefs resemble the question they agreed to review. In an effort to offer something predictive about what we might see at the argument, I would point to two things. The first is a deep-seated skepticism of securities fraud litigation held by some of the justices, who tend to view litigation in this area as akin to extortion based on hindsight. The court has also issued a number of decisions in recent years in favor of corporate interests that have weakened federal regulators, including at the Securities and Exchange Commission. On the other hand, it is a powerful benefit to the investors that the government filed a parallel suit against Facebook, contending that its disclosures about security breaches were insufficient; the government appears in full support of the investors and will share in their oral argument time. It similarly helps the investors that there is a forceful and direct friend-of-the-court brief signed by most of the most famous securities law scholars, arguing that the securities laws bar any kind of categorical exception for misleading statements made in forward-looking risk disclosures.

Time Published: 2024-11-04T20:30:36Z

Novo Nordisk (NVO+2.18%), the maker of blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, has entered an agreement with Denmark-based Ascendis Pharma (ASND-2.12%) to leverage the latter’s advanced drug delivery technology. The partnership aims to speed up the development of a long-acting, monthly GLP-1 drug. Current GLP-1 medications on the market are administered as once-weekly injections. “Developing potential therapies that can be administered less frequently could benefit societies as well as individual patients, and it is a clear focus area for Novo Nordisk,” Brian Vandahl, senior vice president of global research technologies at Novo Nordisk, said in a press release. “We look forward to working with Ascendis to explore the potential of the TransCon technology platform to reduce the dosing frequency of GLP-1 receptor agonists and other treatments for cardiometabolic diseases.” GLP-1 treatments are a class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite. Demand for these medications has transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+2.79%), the producer of competing drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Viking Therapeutics is also developing a monthly GLP-1 weight-loss drug. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Under the deal, Novo Nordisk has secured the exclusive worldwide license to use Ascendis’ TransCon technology platform to develop, produce, and sell products for metabolic diseases, including obesity and Type 2 diabetes with the primary goal being to develop a monthly GLP-1. Ascendis could receive up to $285 million in total payments for this leading drug program, covering upfront fees, development, and regulatory milestones. The company will also be eligible for sales-based milestone payments and royalties on global net sales. For each additional product candidate targeting metabolic or cardiovascular diseases, Ascendis could earn up to $77.5 million. Ascendis will handle the initial development of TransCon-based product candidates, with Novo Nordisk covering these early development costs. Novo Nordisk will also take charge of clinical development, regulatory approvals, large-scale manufacturing, and commercialization.

Perplexity, an AI search company, wants you to use artificial intelligence to track election results. The company launched its Election Information Hub on Friday to offer AI-generated answers to questions you have about elections. The hub provides summaries of candidates and their policies — with somewhat vague descriptions — and offers information about local ballot initiatives. “People deserve a clear, easy way to find the information they seek, and few topics are as consequential as elections,” the company said in a statement. “We want to do our part to support an informed electorate, so we’ve built the election hub on Perplexity’s answer engine: an entry point for understanding key issues, voting intelligently, and tracking election results.” The company told The Verge it’s partnering with the Associated Press and Democracy Works to gather its data, and Perplexity cites Wikipedia in many of its entries. “We selected domains that are non-partisan and fact-checked, including Ballotpedia and news organizations. We’re actively monitoring our systems to ensure that we continue to prioritize these sources when answering election-related queries,” Perplexity’s spokesperson said. The company, which has backing from Jeff Bezos and Nvidia (NVDA+2.24%), has previously been accused in a WIRED investigation of: making things up, often inaccurately summarizing topics, and even attributing fake quotes to real people. WIRED dubbed the site a “bullshit machine.” But Perplexity believes its election hub will not have similar problems. “We want to make it as simple as possible to receive trusted, easy-to-understand information to inform your voting decisions,” the company said. “For each response, you can view the sources that informed an answer, allowing you to dive deeper and verify referenced materials.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: World stocks tread water ahead of crunch US election

European and US stocks fell flat on Monday as investors treaded carefully before the US presidential election that will impact the world economy, with a US Federal Reserve interest rate cut also expected later in the week. In the US presidential race, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump remain virtually tied in opinion polls ahead of Tuesday’s vote. It might not be clear who has won for days after voting ends. Mr Trump’s policies on immigration, tax cuts and tariffs may put upward pressure on inflation, bond yields and the dollar, analysts believe, while Harris is seen as the continuity candidate. “We are too evenly divided and polarised to suggest a red sweep,” Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. “The Senate looks like it will swing Republican, but the presidency and the house are simply too close to call,” he said. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe added 0.3 per cent , while the dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of currencies, eased 0.29 per cent to 103.63. Iseq heavyweight Ryanair traded flat (remaining at €18) despite a court ruling pausing the effects of a Dublin Airport passenger cap that was due to imminently affect airlines’ access to take-off and landing slots over the summer 2025 period. The airline along with rival Aer Lingus last week brought an urgent application over the Irish Aviation Authority’s (IAA’s) decision to limit passenger numbers to 25.2 million for the period. Most of the other big players on the exchange AIB, Kingspan, Kerry and Glanbia ended the session in the red as investors awaited bigger news later in the week. Permanent TSB and hotel group Dalata were among the few shares to advance. European stocks retreated on Monday as caution over the imminent US presidential election weighed on the regional benchmark, though losses were kept in check by buoyant banking and energy shares. M&A speculation, especially in the luxury goods sector, sparked some sizable moves. EssilorLuxottica popped higher on renewed chatter that Meta Platforms is weighing a stake in the eyewear manufacturer. Elsewhere, Schneider Electric shares slipped after the French electric equipment maker named Olivier Blum as chief executive officer, just days after the group was among companies fined by French antitrust regulators over a price-fixing pact. European equities have drifted lower over the past month or so as investors brace for multiple risk events, including this week’s US presidential election, as well as interest rate decisions from both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The UK’s benchmark FTSE 100 rose marginally on Monday, helped by energy shares, while cautious investors braced for the U.S. presidential election and a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) later this week. The blue-chip FTSE 100 was up 0.1 per cent at 8,184.24 points, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 dipped 0.1 per cent. The heavyweight oil and gas sector rose 0.7 per cent as oil prices jumped more than 2 per cent after a decision by OPEC+ to delay increasing output by a month. The personal goods sector, however, led sectoral gains, driven by an 4.8 per cent jump in Burberry after a report that Italy’s Moncler was considering a bid for the luxury retailer. The banking sector rose 1.1 per cent, supported by Natwest Group that advanced 2.6 per cent to a 13-year high. US stock indexes slipped in choppy trading on Monday, as investors braced for a pivotal week for global markets in which Americans will elect a new president and the Federal Reserve is likely to cut its benchmark policy rate. Some of the so-called “Trump trades” lost ground after a recent poll showed Ms Harris leading in Iowa, triggering a retreat in dollar, bond yields and bitcoin. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 397.83 points, or 0.95 per cent, to 41,654.14,and the S&P 500 lost 27.52 points, or 0.48 per cent, to 5,701.28. Most megacap stocks lost ground, with Tesla dropping 1.8 per cent as the EV maker’s China-made vehicle sales fell in October. However, chip heavyweight Nvidia rose 1.6 per cent, after S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday the company would replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Intel’s 4.3 per cent slide weighed on the Dow. - Additional reporting by Bloomberg and Reuters Eoin Burke-Kennedy is Economics Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The Dow drops 200 points as investors brace for Election Day

On the eve of Election Day, the Dow Jones slid 200 points as investors held back, anxiously awaiting the results. The subdued stock activity coincided with a rally in safe-haven U.S. Treasurys, indicating that some investors are shifting toward lower-risk assets in anticipation of potential market volatility. By afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dipped by 203 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed slight gains of 0.16% and 0.10%, respectively. The cautious trading reflects broader market sentiment, with investors balancing optimism against uncertainty ahead of the election outcome. Palantir Technologies (PLTR+0.76%) is set to release its earnings report after the closing bell. Known for its advanced AI tools used by military and intelligence agencies, Palantir has become a prominent player amid the tech world’s ongoing AI surge. Moreover, this Thursday, investors will closely monitor the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate decision, as well as the subsequent press conference featuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Nvidia (NVDA+2.24%) shares rose over 1% on Monday as the AI chipmaker is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises the 30 leading U.S. stocks. This inclusion marks a significant milestone for Nvidia and reflects its growing influence in the tech and AI sectors. To make room for Nvidia, longtime Dow member Intel (INTC+4.79%) will be removed from the index, signaling a shift in focus toward AI-driven growth. In response to the news, Intel shares fell by 4%. The reshuffling is set to take effect at the end of the week. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A-1.76%) has continued to sell off considerable stakes in several companies as it grows its cash pile to a record $325.2 billion. In the third quarter, Berkshire sold $36.1 billion of stock overall, including from major holdings Apple (AAPL+2.21%) and Bank of America (BAC-1.37%), the company disclosed in regulatory filings Saturday. Meanwhile, it purchased just $1.5 billion of stock in that same period. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article.

Title: Playing The U.S. Elections - Part 1: Stocks To Pick If You Favor Trump

BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA - OCTOBER 05: Elon Musk embraces Republican presidential nominee, former ... [+] President Donald Trump during a campaign rally at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds on October 05, 2024 in Butler, Pennsylvania. This is the first time that Trump has returned to Butler since he was injured during an attempted assassination on July 13. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) The U.S. Presidential election is nearing its curtain call. And from the look of things, this is going to be yet another photo finish. If you think Trump's Make America Great Again campaign did enough to get him past the finishing line - and into the White House - for a second term, then here is a list of stocks that you could bet on to make the most of market movements in the near term. And, for the flip side, check out Harris Stocks: Promising Picks If Harris Wins. The stocks that we believe will benefit the most from Trump's return to office are: DJT is a no-brainer, since Trump is the majority shareholder in the company which operates the social media platform Truth Social. Admittedly, the stock has been extremely volatile over the last one year, with prices swinging between a low of $11.75 and a high of $79.38 over this period. While the stock has gained 75% so far this year, it fell more than 30% last week. The stock should see significant gains if Trump wins, but be prepared for more such wild swings till the result is locked in. Two more companies that are directly associated with Trump, and should see a big win with Trump. Rumble is an online video platform and cloud services business that hosts Truth Social, and Phunware is a mobile software company that provided campaign data and also built a reelection app for Trump in the past. While both stocks have been very volatile, like DJT, since the beginning of this year, trading activity in RUM has been more stable in the last six months - making it the better pick among the two. Elon Musk has been a vocal supporter of Trump, and the time (and money) invested by the billionaire inventor on the Trump campaign is expected to yield strong returns for his companies if Trump wins. We detailed the entwined fates of Trump and Tesla in Musk's Trump Card: Will Tesla Be Boosted Or Totaled? and Can Trump Take Tesla Stock To $0? There is no denying that TSLA stock stands to gain big from a Trump win - both near- as well as long-term. Besides the personal camaraderie between Trump and Musk, Trump's frequent calls for higher tariffs for Chinese imports (including Chinese-made EVs) should directly help Tesla sell more cars in the U.S. Stocks of the two largest oil service companies in the world have had a very forgettable year, with both of them losing 25% of their value so far. But that could change very quickly if Trump emerges victorious. Trump's support for oil and gas companies will reflect in favorable policies by his administration policies toward conventional energy companies which took a backseat to renewable energy companies under Biden's administration. Schlumberger and Halliburton stand out in particular among oil and gas companies because their stocks are less volatile in the near term than those of diversified energy companies such as Exxon Mobil or Chevron. And both SLB and HAL figure among the most undervalued Energy stocks in our analysis. Several of Trump's poll promises look better for U.S. businesses as a whole - particularly his talks about additional cuts to corporate taxes. The round of tax cuts he introduced in 2017 had a tangible impact on overall business sentiment and banks benefited in particular from the increased level of activity across industries. We expect a similar benefit for banks this time, too, if Trump returns, with the diversified banking giants gaining the most due to their strong presence in retail, private, commercial as well as corporate banking services. Both BAC and C are good picks in the event of a Trump win as we believe they are among the most undervalued Diversified Bank stocks All the stocks above are great near-term picks in the event Trump wins the U.S. elections. But that is not the only possible outcome of this election. And election-related trends will soon give way to long-term trends across industries. In the long run, the stocks you pick should add value to your portfolio without being too volatile. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the period 2021-2023. And as a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Election betting sites pour money into social media ads ahead

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time While the latest polls suggest that the presidential election may be a close one, some social media advertisements are painting a very different picture. In some ads for the online betting platform Polymarket, graphs illustrate former President Donald Trump’s lead as “up to 32% in the odds” over Vice President Kamala Harris, claiming the service is “the most accurate way to track the election.” What Polymarket isn’t always disclosing alongside the ads, though, is that the displayed percentages are actually odds tabulated based on bets placed with its service, not projections based on representative voter polling. Well over half of the ads don’t mention that the numbers are rooted in prediction-based markets. “The idea is if people disagree with the market price, they have the opportunity to capitalize by buying the side they think is priced too low,” Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan said in a social media post. Some ads for the platform read, “Don’t trust the polls — trust the markets.” The social media ads have flooded Facebook, Instagram, X and other platforms. On Meta alone, Polymarket has poured at least $50,000 into a campaign including 45 advertisements, which promote the odds, according to data available in Facebook’s ad library. One advertisement — viewed more than 900,000 times on Facebook and Instagram since Oct. 28 — depicts Trump winning in the Polymarket odds, according to the Meta Ad Library. Among the viewers, 20% are men ages 45 to 54 and 12% are women in the same age range. The advertisement was seen the most in California, New York and Texas, with 16%, 11%, and 10% of viewers in those regions, respectively. Several others include questions such as “Did serving fries help Trump’s chances?” or “Does Trump have all the aura?” Of the 45 Meta ads, many include solo images of Trump, some include side-by-side images of both candidates, and none include solo images of Harris. A separate sponsored campaign from the right-wing social media personality Shaneyy Richh included nine advertisements promoting Polymarket forecasts. “The full list of actual conservatives that get polled by political pollsters,” read one ad, which depicted a man squinting at a small piece of paper. “Tired of biased polls? Find out what’s really happening in the 2024 race,” the caption said. On X — owned by one of Trump’s biggest supporters, Elon Musk — advertisements also promoted the predictions on its search page. Polymarket, which offers bets in sports, business, science, politics and more, reports that users have spent more than $2.7 billion placing bets on the next president. According to an X post, one user bet $2.2 million on a Harris win. Based on user bets, Polymarket says Trump’s odds of winning are roughly 65.5% and Harris’ are 34.5% as of Oct. 31. “Odds on Polymarket are derived from the market price of a contract that pays $1 if an event occurs and expires worthless if it doesn’t,” a Polymarket blog post reads. “For example, someone paying 60 cents for a Trump ‘yes’ contract, implies a 60% chance that he wins.” Not all are quick to place bets or even trust Polymarket’s system. “Trump and right-wing influencers are pushing these Polymarket odds as a poll,” Claudio Vallejo, an online creator, said via a TikTok video. “They’re using these odds as proof or evidence that Trump is peaking at the right moment and is so popular that there’s no way he can lose in November. ... They’re laying the groundwork for ‘too big to rig.’” A company spokesperson referred to a “misunderstanding” of the company, explaining the stats are not opinion polls but odds calculated by shares traded on Polymarket. The odds aren’t meant to reflect public opinion; they reflect bettors’ level of confidence in either a Trump win or a Harris win. “A big point of confusion is that both vote share and odds are expressed as a percent, but do not mean the same thing,” Polymarket wrote on its Substack page. Coplan recently took to X to defend the platform as “non-partisan,” calling it a “reality check” meant to “harness the power of free markets to demystify the real world events that matter most to you.” “Polymarket is not about politics,” he wrote in a statement on X on Oct. 25. “This US election cycle, we’ve been pulled onto center stage, as people are fed up with having to make sense of ‘For You’ feeds, pundits, and incongruent polls — we take that responsibility seriously. ... Hopefully politics is the first step to get the masses to realize the value of market-based forecasts.” Though the ads are trending in the U.S., it is prohibited for “U.S. persons,” any citizen or even any temporary resident to take part in the betting, according to Polymarket’s terms. Currently, Polymarket requires bettors to accept terms and conditions confirming they are “not a resident, national, or agent of the United States” or several other countries where the platform is regulated against. In 2022, Polymarket was fined $1.4 million by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which said that it was illegally running events betting in the U.S. A federal appeals court recently overturned the CFTC’s decision to prohibit election betting company Kalshi from limiting “U.S. persons” from placing bets on their markets — but Polymarket wasn’t part of that suit, and the law that prohibits betting on Polymarket is still in place. Kalshi’s stats show a 59% and 41% division between Trump and Harris, respectively. The company has also used social media to promote election betting, spending over $140,000 on Meta ads, according to the company's ad library. While people in the U.S. aren’t supposed to place their own bets, a Polymarket spokesperson said the platform could be useful for Americans because it acts as a live information source similar to the stock market. The social media advertisements don’t explicitly encourage people in the U.S. to bet, but they also don’t include a disclaimer about the regulation. Nevertheless, the site is gaining attention from many right-wing officials and celebrities, including Trump himself. “We’re up in the polls pretty substantially. They have a new phenomenon, and that’s a gambling poll. They call it the poly poll or something I’ve never heard of,” Trump said at a rally in Michigan on Oct. 18, with a crowd member shouting out “Polymarket” to correct him. “Polymarket, and I guess it’s 64 to 38, 36, something like that. So that’s not bad. I don’t know what the hell it means, but it means that we’re doing pretty well,” he added. Though Polymarket called Trump’s reference to the company a “common error” of “confusing Polymarket odds with polls,” a paid advertisement shares the rally clip with the caption: “they call it the pollypoll or something.” The Instagram reel doesn’t include contain any similar clarification as the one on the blog post. Musk also took to X to share the predictions — then 67% and 33.1% for Trump and Harris, respectively. In another post, Musk said Polymarket odds were “more accurate than polls.” A Nov. 3 NBC News poll found Harris and Trump were deadlocked among respondents, each with 49% support from registered voters. Every major poll from the last week shows a split between the candidates from 0 to 3 percentage points, with most differences falling within the margins of error. Some experts warn people to use caution when they analyze both the polls and the markets. “When people look at polls, one is just expecting real precision at a specific moment,” John Fortier, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute focusing on topics such as election demographics and voting, told NBC News last week. “It’s not that we can’t get good information ... but if you’re really expecting polling to tell you ... what’s going to happen next Tuesday absolutely, obviously there’s just built-in margin of error.” Though Fortier said the financial risk associated with markets can be seen as a “more serious” gesture than answers on a poll, he emphasized “real doubts” and warned that “the details matter.” “I just see the possibilities for more market distortion,” he said. “I’m generally skeptical, and then I’m even more skeptical of a market that is narrower but also excludes American citizens.” Sophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: A new weight loss pill outperformed Novo Nordisk's version

Time Published: 2024-11-04T15:39:55Z

Viking Therapeutics (VKTX+4.54%) released new clinical trial data on Sunday for its experimental weight-loss drugs, which include a highly anticipated oral pill. The San Diego-based company’s stock surged over 6% during pre-market trading on Monday. It has since fallen about 5% from its closing price on Friday. This marks the latest development in the competitive race among pharmaceutical companies to introduce new weight-loss drug alternatives to current market leaders like Wegovy, Zepbound, and Ozempic. Viking Therapeutics shared on Sunday the latest data of its two clinical trials testing an injection and pill versions of its experimental weight-loss treatment VK2735 at the industry conference Obesity Week in San Antonio, Texas. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know The company reported that in a small phase 1 clinical study, patients who took a daily 100mg dose of Viking’s weight-loss pill lost an average of up to 6.8% of their body weight over 28 days when adjusted for those taking a placebo. William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh noted on Monday that Viking’s results surpassed Wall Street expectations and outperformed those of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+2.18%) experimental weight-loss pill, amycretin. “Notably, the 100 mg dose appears to be outpacing the 100 mg dose of amycretin, which achieved about a 5% placebo-adjusted weight loss in four weeks,” Hsieh wrote. Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 2% on Monday morning. In a phase 2 trial of the same drug administered as a weekly injection, patients experienced an average weight loss of 14.7% over 13 weeks. For comparison, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY+2.79%) Zepbound lost over 20% of their weight after 72 weeks during a clinical trial. U.K.-based pharma giant AstraZeneca (AZN+1.35%) also shared new details about its weight-loss drug pipeline at the conference on Monday. In an early-stage clinical trial, patients taking the company’s pill lost an average of 5.8% of their body weight over four weeks. The pill, which it licensed last year from the Chinese biotech Eccogene, was deemed safe and tolerable and will advance to phase 2 clinical trials. AstraZeneca is also developing two additional obesity drugs: one targeting the hormone amylin and a GLP-1 injectable. After the launch of the diabetes medication Ozempic in 2017, the demand for weight-loss drugs has skyrocketed in recent years. Fervent demand for Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic over the last year had the company racing to keep up with supply. The Denmark-based company’s revenue even buoyed the nation’s GDP in 2023. Several pharmaceutical companies are now chasing the hype, working to introduce new drugs to get in on the demand. In addition to Viking Therapeutics, Regeneron, Amgen, Pfizer, and Zealand Pharma are all developing weight-loss drugs. Unsatisfied with their own success, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also developing even more powerful weight-loss drugs. The majority of these companies are also working to introduce weight-loss pills. Weight-loss drugs that already on the market are administered as once-weekly injections. But a pill could help with current supply constraints and open the market to patients hesitant to taking injections.

Title: A Nvidia partner's stock surged because Nvidia wants chips faster

An Nvidia (NVDA+2.24%) partner in South Korea saw its shares surge Monday after it said the U.S.-based chipmaker wants chips faster. SK Hynix’s South Korea–listed shares closed up almost 6.5% after SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won told reporters that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asked the company to move supply of its next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips up by six months. Chey, speaking at the SK AI Summit in Seoul, added that Nvidia is still struggling to fulfill chip demand but that the two are working together on the shortage, Bloomberg reported. Huang requested that SK Hynix provide samples of its HBM4 chips earlier than expected, Chey said. In October, SK Hynix said it expected to supply customers with the new HBM chip, which Nvidia needs for its artificial intelligence chips, by the second half of 2025. Chey said both Nvidia and SK Hynix “are on the same page” about HBM4’s schedule, according to Bloomberg. The South Korea-based chipmaker’s shares are up 37.1% so far this year. The company also unveiled a 16-layer HBM3E at the summit that it said will be with customers early next year. SK Hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung said the company will release the next-generation HBM5 and HBM5E sometime between 2028 and 2030. In October, SK Hynix reported record revenue, operating profit, and net profit, “achieving best-ever quarterly performance” in the third quarter on demand for its memory chips for AI technology. “SK Hynix has solidified its position as the world’s No.1 AI memory company by achieving the highest business performance ever in the third quarter of this year,” Kim Woohyun, chief financial officer at SK Hynix, said in a statement. “We will continue to maximize profitability while securing stable revenues by taking flexible product and supply strategies in line with market demand.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia is about to replace Intel in the Dow

Nvidia (NVDA+2.24%) shares rose 1% in Monday morning trading as the AI chipmaker is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises the 30 leading U.S. stocks. This inclusion marks a significant milestone for Nvidia and reflects its growing influence in the tech and AI sectors. To make room for Nvidia, longtime Dow member Intel (INTC+4.79%) will be removed from the index, signaling a shift in focus toward AI-driven growth. In response to the news, Intel shares fell by 4%. The reshuffling is set to take effect at the end of the week. Nvidia, often hailed as an “AI darling,” has seen substantial gains throughout the year, driven by its advancements in AI chip technology. The company’s growth trajectory is expected to continue in the coming year, bolstered by expanding interest and investment in artificial intelligence — a field where Nvidia remains a clear leader. Nvidia’s in-demand Hopper chips, which power some of the world’s most advanced generative AI models, have propelled the company to record-high quarterly results and a $3 trillion valuation. The chipmaker’s next-generation Blackwell AI chip platform was launched in March and has seen a large surge in demand. The stock split Nvidia announced earlier this year also boosted popularity and growth. The company’s share price has surged by 173% so far this year — and by 193% in the past year. In the past five years, the stock has seen an astronomical 2,498% rise. In contrast, Intel has lagged in the AI boom and missed key opportunities. For example, Intel decided to pass on investing in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, which has since revolutionized AI applications and reached a valuation of around $80 billion. Intel’s stock has suffered, dropping over 53% this year alone, highlighting the challenges the company faces as it tries to catch up with more agile competitors such as Nvidia.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell about 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dipped slightly.

Energy (XLE) stocks also rose on Monday amid rising oil prices. Investors are focused on this Tuesday's highly anticipated US presidential elections, followed by a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The markets largely anticipate policy makers will announce a rate cut of 25 basis points following the meeting. Affordability concerns are locking more potential first-time homebuyers out of the housing market. A new report shows that first-time homebuyers made up 24% of all buyers this year, marking the lowest share since 1981, according to data from the 2024 National Association of Realtors (NAR) profile of home buyers and sellers. High home prices, elevated borrowing costs and low inventory have hammered affordability over the past year, leaving many first-time buyers on the fence about purchasing a home. In July, the NAR surveyed over 167,000 recent homebuyers, who said the barriers to entry remained challenging. “In the time frame surveyed, mortgage interest rates jumped to nearly 8%, and housing affordability reduced to historical lows. Home buyers continued to struggle with housing inventory,” NAR’s deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told Yahoo Finance. “At the same time, rental prices were rising and after a student debt pause, borrowers had to resume payments, making it difficult to save for a downpayment,” Lautz added. Mortgage rates have jumped to between 6% to 7% this year — and now average mortgage rates are rising after hitting a two-year low in September. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers may also be bidding against those making all-cash offers. “If a buyer was on solid financial footing to enter the buying market and there were multiple offers, there is a chance they were up against an all-cash offer,” Lautz said. Oil futures jumped more than 2.5% on Monday after OPEC+ announced it would delay unwinding production cuts by a month. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to trade above $71 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $75 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries along with Russia and other countries said it would continue with its output cuts for one month until the end of 2024. The decision to delay adding 180,000 million barrels per day starting in December had already been postponed in recent months amid volatile oil prices.

Title: NVIDIA Starts Diverting Orders Away From Super Micro Computer (SMCI) As A Potential Delisting And DOJ Investigation Loom Large

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a retailer of high-performance servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, is NVIDIA's third-largest customer. Additionally, in what is a testament to the heretofore symbiotic relationship between these two entities, SMCI's biggest client is NVIDIA, and its second-biggest client is an entity that is backed by NVIDIA. Now, however, it appears that NVIDIA has had enough of Super Micro Computer's near-constant headaches, and is deliberately trying to create some much-needed distance. *NVIDIA HAS BEGUN REDIRECTING ORDERS FROM SUPER MICRO COMPUTER TO OTHER SUPPLIERS IN ORDER TO PREVENT SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS $NVDA $SMCI $DELL $HPE — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) November 4, 2024 To wit, Digi Times is reporting today that NVIDIA has begun redirecting its orders that were originally placed with Super Micro Computer to other suppliers. This development comes as SMCI is now contending with allegations of financial malfeasance, a preliminary DOJ investigation, the exodus of its second auditor in around 18 months, and an imminent de-listing from the Nasdaq exchange. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Super Micro Computer's travails began in August when Hindenburg Research detailed instances of alleged accounting fraud and corporate governance malfeasance in a detailed report. SMCI then delayed the filing of its annual report for the fiscal year that ended on the 30th of June, presumably in a bid to undertake an internal review. Do note that under the prevailing statutory requirements, SMCI's annual report had to be filed by the 30th of August. Meanwhile, the DOJ has also reportedly launched an investigation into the affairs at Super Micro Computer, with a particular focus on the alleged accounting violations. As per Hindenburg Research's anecdotes, Super Micro Computer engaged in distribution channel stuffing by pushing products to distributors based on artificially inflated demand forecasts, undertook partial shipments to meet specific sales targets and inflated its total shipment count in the process, re-hired top executives responsible for "widespread accounting violations" that had resulted in a $17.5 million settlement with the SEC, and paid nearly a billion dollars over the past three years to non-arm's-length suppliers such as Ablecom and Compuware. Finally, do note that the Nasdaq exchange recently warned Super Micro Computer of a potential de-listing action should it fail to file the requisite annual report by the 16th of November. That punitive action could come as soon as the 20th of November. Meanwhile, as we noted in a dedicated post earlier today, Super Micro Computer has negotiated major changes to its loan agreement with Cathay Bank, with the firm now required to furnish audited financial statements by the 31st of December as opposed to the earlier covenant, which posited the 28th of October as the deadline for furnishing these financial documents.

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. As a channel, it remains key to growth for many retailers. But the era of the DTC brand as we know it is over. In 2019, DTC brands Casper, Away and Glossier were touting $1 billion-plus valuations, all of them reaching that threshold within five years of being founded. They were riding high on cheap capital, a strong economy and the hype the direct-to-consumer model had generated. The next couple of years would see Casper go public, alongside retail darling Warby Parker and sustainable footwear brand Allbirds. At the same time, all three trumpeted big plans for brick-and-mortar footprints and category expansion, and touted the strength of the DTC model. It seemed DTC brands could do no wrong. Then, things changed. Casper was sold to private equity just two years after it went public, Allbirds announced store closures and a shift to a “more profitable” distributor model globally, and Outdoor Voices abruptly shuttered its fleet of stores before being snapped up by the same firm that owns Draper James. “Everyone believed the mantra should be DTC or die because they wanted to eliminate the middle person and make more money,” Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, said. “What they finally realized was: No one eliminates the middle person, they simply become the middle person, and that brings its own set of costs. So for a period of time, people became so obsessed with where they sell rather than what they sell that they lost track of who they were.” Precipitous sales declines at former disruptors, including those buoyed by the pandemic like Peloton, became somewhat of a norm. The bike company and its peers also grew steadily more interested in other sales channels, including Amazon and more traditional wholesale partners. The more established brands that had jumped on board the DTC bandwagon when it was chugging along also began pulling back, recognizing some of the same challenges, and the allure of purely DTC brands faded. “If Allbirds had remained on its strong growth trajectory, if Peloton had maintained the growth tear it was on, the models probably wouldn't have pivoted that much. But they did change — and both companies fell into difficulties,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said, noting those challenges pushed both brands to expand their sales channels. “Now that genie has been let out of the bottle, it's not going to be put back in.” Even brands like Lululemon, which sells mostly DTC, have wholesale accounts, Saunders noted. “The term DTC is still used as a shorthand. I'm just not quite sure it's all that relevant now,” he said. Asked if we’ll still be talking about DTC brands in five years, Siegel put it more bluntly. “In a derogatory, backwards-looking fashion? Sure.” As the direct-to-consumer model matured, a slew of factors that helped DTC brands flourish began waning. The general retail market slowed, customer acquisition costs on social media surged, venture funds dried up, the cost to fulfill online orders grew and brands started hitting their own growth ceilings. “There's a lot of things that moved and shifted in a relatively short period of time that meant that DTC went from being almost the darling or the hero of retail, to being a channel that had a lot of challenges and problems,” Saunders said. “And had a lot to prove that it wasn't necessarily, in some cases, proving.” The model itself was flawed from the start, according to Siegel, whose firm has done multiple reports on the impact selling direct-to-consumer has on key metrics like gross margin. Critically, Siegel found that brands pivoting to direct did not see a relative increase in revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating profit or operating margin. “It just didn't happen. Back then, obviously, that was controversial — and it triggered a lot of fights,” Siegel said. “But now people are looking at the results and they're acknowledging wholesale, when done right, is truly a powerful thing.” “There was so much money sloshing around, it was very difficult to do badly.” Neil Saunders Managing Director at GlobalData Some up-and-coming brands, including Vuori, may have dodged some of the growing pains in the sector by embracing wholesale from the start. Founder Joe Kudla has said before that the company saw a place for key wholesale partners from the beginning of its business and touted those relationships as part of the reason it was able to achieve profitability. “The partners we selected at the start in the U.S., and those we work with today globally, are very intentionally picked, and our distribution is deliberately limited to only the best accounts,” Andy Lawrence, vice president of international at Vuori, said via email. “While I wouldn’t say wholesale insulates any brand from all DTC challenges, at Vuori, it does add a critical component to our success. Wholesale, if done correctly, allows brands like us to connect authentically with the local customer.” Still, for a time many DTC brands simply didn’t invest in wholesale as a channel because selling directly to consumers was working. And investors were enthusiastic about funding DTC brands, profitability challenges or not, because capital was cheap and consumers had disposable income to spend on new brands and discretionary products. “There was so much money sloshing around, it was very difficult to do badly,” Saunders said. But in a more discriminating market, the value proposition of some of retail’s startups became far more important — and was often found wanting. Expensive exercise bikes and fancy sheets are harder to sell in a more risk-averse economy. “It's very important not to confuse problems with DTC — which, there are problems — with problems with the brand,” Saunders added. “Allbirds primarily has a brand problem. It doesn't really have a distribution problem, as such. So Allbirds could push itself into more stores, do more things — it's still not going to resolve the issues of the company because the problem is with the product and the position and the brand, it isn’t with the distribution method.” As startups and traditional brands alike recognize the limits of DTC, many are embracing a more measured model that values both DTC and wholesale. The sensibility of that approach has been touted frequently over the past few years as brands have moved away from strictly digital approaches, with one report earlier this year saying wholesale is still the most profitable investment channel for brands. "People chase simplicity when it seems to be intuitive." Simeon Siegel Managing Director at BMO Capital Markets Matt Katz, a managing partner at SSA & Company, describes what’s happening now as a “reset” driven by overinvestment in DTC and underinvestment in stores. The importance of stores and wholesale is now sending investments back in the other direction, and retailers are unlikely to lean back into DTC as hard as they did — that is, unless investors start funding it again. “Silly as it sounds, people chase simplicity when it seems to be intuitive. This is not the first time, and it certainly will not be the last time, that everyone chased a buzzword,” Siegel said. “When companies don't need to be profitable, profit and loss statements are not scrutinized. When companies don't need to be profitable, expenses are not scrutinized. That makes it much easier to chase a hope and a belief versus being held accountable for the actual results.” The swing to DTC — and the correction since then — has taught both brands and wholesalers some important lessons. Take Nike, for example. The rise of DTC brands spurred a huge investment from the sportswear giant in its own digital capabilities and stores, and at the same time caused Nike to cut ties with a slew of wholesale partners it deemed less important to its overall strategy. First, that led to exceptional growth. Then came a retraction, as Nike determined it had taken things too far and, in fact, did need those wholesale partners after all. Throw in layoffs, a cost-savings plan, a lawsuit surrounding the success of the DTC strategy and an abrupt CEO swap and you have a pretty good summary of the fallout to date. “DTC serves a lot of Nike customers, but it doesn't serve all of Nike's customers. A lot of product discovery, a lot of buying of Nike products is done by people who might go into a department store, especially some of the older age cohorts,” Saunders said. “These people are not going to go online directly to Nike. They want to buy it through the channels that they shop in. And if Nike disappears or pulls back from some of these channels, they lose the sales — it's as simple as that. And they underestimated that. They were almost a little bit arrogant as to the power of the Nike brand.” And make no mistake, Nike is a powerful brand. A $50 billion-a-year brand. “Consumers have taken over the leverage point and they are buying on availability and price and experience.” Matt Katz Managing Partner at SSA & Company But as Nike was learning its lessons, both good and bad, about DTC, its wholesale partners were also learning theirs. Foot Locker, one of the retailers Nike spurned and is now again seeking closer ties with, has unveiled its own turnaround actions to lure brands to its shelves, including revamping two-thirds of its Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker stores over the next few years. Macy’s, too, which received similar treatment from Nike, has been undergoing store refreshes at its go-forward locations as it looks to keep customers and brand partners coming back. “I think that the wholesale side really had to pull its socks up as well,” Saunders said, noting that retailers like Macy’s and Foot Locker have realized they are “serving two masters” now. “‘One of our masters is the consumer, but the other master is the brands. Because the brands don't have to be in our store necessarily and what we've got to prove to them is that we're a worthwhile partner.’” Indeed, while the pendulum has swung back toward wholesale, some brands are still moving away from certain retailers and could continue to do so if their partners don’t serve them well. Levi’s in its Q3 earnings report touted that its wholesale business now makes up less than 20% of its revenue, down from 30% in 2015. Analysts at the time pointed to Levi’s sales and profit growth as a sign that its DTC strategy is working, at least for now. “I think we've moved from retailers having the advantage. The retail-brand wholesale relationship used to be heavy, heavy retail. That was your point of distribution and the retailer chose which brands were most important, right?” Katz said. He noted that the balance shifted when brands developed their own access to customers through DTC. Now, Katz says, the consumer is in charge. “Consumers have taken over the leverage point and they are buying on availability and price and experience.” That means brands need to focus on being wherever the customer wants to buy, which might sometimes be wholesale and might sometimes be DTC and might sometimes be Amazon. "It became a battle of players within the ecosystem — who could edge out their collaborator." Simeon Siegel Managing Director at BMO Capital Markets During the height of DTC mania, companies like Nike and Adidas became very focused on what percentage of their revenue was DTC versus wholesale. Nike had a goal of upping DTC from 40% of its revenue to 60% by 2025, while Adidas aimed to reach a 50% DTC split by the same time period. Even with wholesale coming back in vogue, there is no universal answer for what that split should be, according to Siegel, and brands should be adjusting those percentages based on their individual needs. Having a strong DTC business also doesn’t have to come at the expense of wholesale. For Vuori, having wholesale partners has helped it gain brand awareness in new markets like the U.K. and Japan. “From that initial interaction, we then begin to see these newcomers start to interact and shop with us via our DTC channels too,” Lawrence said. “The omnichannel approach, including wholesale, is our best answer for how to expand in a profitable, brand accretive way.” DTC and wholesale have different strengths, according to Siegel, with DTC theoretically offering first-party data, higher margins, greater control over the brand and greater connection to consumers, while wholesale ideally gives brands a partner with experience distributing products economically and efficiently. “It became a battle,” Siegel said of how brands began approaching DTC and wholesale a few years ago. “It became a battle of players within the ecosystem — who could edge out their collaborator, as opposed to a holistic partnership where all sides could win.” A case could be made that the battle is largely over now, with hybrid models being embraced across the industry and wholesale-brand relationships becoming more collaborative. But what does all this mean for future brands? While most analysts agree that a hybrid model is the future, they also tend to agree that DTC will continue to be important for retail’s newest entrants. The channel is easy to set up and has lower initial costs, which makes it ideal for upstarts, but as the era of DTC brands fades, retail could also see more brands launching with partnerships already in place. When Vanessa Hudgens relaunched her beauty brand Know Beauty, for example, she did so with Amazon. And beauty brand Pretty Smart entered the market through an exclusive deal with Walmart as well as its own website, even working with the mass merchant to develop its product line prior to launch. “I think you'll see some of these brands may launch with very small strategic partnerships that give them their presence,” Katz said. “And if you can prove that the brand has staying power and pull, then you'll see continued investments in flagship real estate models.” That could range from pop-ups to permanent stores or limited geographic partnerships with retailers, Katz said, but regardless, there is likely to be a greater emphasis on how quickly a brand can grow its points of distribution. Some up-and-coming brands already offer prime examples of this: Actor Millie Bobby Brown launched her fashion brand at Nordstrom within months of its debut online. While they took slightly longer to branch out, intimates brands Skims and Savage X Fenty have both also pursued wholesale relationships, including internationally, in addition to their DTC channels. Pursuing wholesale partnerships isn’t without its challenges, though, particularly for young brands. “The problem with wholesale is you will go into a company and you will say to that company, ‘Look, I want you to stock our product’ and the first thing they will say is, ‘Our shelves are full,’” Saunders said. “So it's very difficult to break through. And then when you do break through, for a younger company, there are a lot of issues that you have to resolve. You have massive working capital requirements because if you're a brand-new brand and you're trying to get into a Walmart — even if Walmart agrees to take you into a fraction of the stores that they have — guess what? Your volume is terrific and most companies don't have the manufacturing capacity.” The model of the future may look a lot more like that of running brands Hoka and On, which have both surged in popularity recently and have benefited from strong DTC sales and also a healthy presence in wholesale. “You will get businesses that start off in both ways, but I think what is fortunate is … we've moved on from simply condemning a channel,” Siegel said. “There's no such thing as a bad channel. There are bad partnerships and there's bad execution.” Another challenge for new brands, according to Saunders, is the simple fact that “there’s a lot of stuff out there” already. Any startups in retail now have to make it through a noisy landscape and offer a valuable enough proposition to gain shopper interest. Identifying as a “DTC brand” just doesn’t much matter anymore. “We went through an era where companies identified themselves, and were known by others, by the outside world, based on where they sell, not what they sell. That's silly, right?” Siegel said. “Are you an apparel retailer? Are you a mattress retailer? Are you a connected fitness bike brand? Or are you a channel? … The idea of where you sell should always be a very important part of your business decision making. But it should not be who you are. You should not aspire to be a DTC brand. You should aspire to sell something special and figure out how to reach your consumer in the most economic, healthy, brand-appropriate way. I think, fortunately, we've moved a lot closer to that.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts CEO Tony Spring surprised the industry with a new tranche of 150 department store closures, 50 of which are shuttering in 2024.

Stock futures were moving higher early Monday ahead of a busy week that includes the presidential election and a Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B) shares were lower after the Warren Buffet-led conglomerate reported declining earnings while reducing its holdings of Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) moved higher ahead of their inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow (DOW). Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares decline despite analysts seeing 26% jump in quarterly revenue in upcoming earnings report. Boeing (BA) shares were up ahead of a vote today from its machinists union on a new labor contract that would end a nearly two-month workers strike. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures trended higher premarket as market watchers are bracing for a week that includes Election Day on Tuesday and a key Federal Reserve interest-rate decision on Thursday. Investors look to build on the gains from Friday’s session, when stocks moved higher after all three major indexes closed October in the red. Oil prices were higher by more than 2% after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with allies that include Russia, announced it would extend output cuts through December. Treasury yields were slightly lower, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury at around 4.28%. Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway reported that its profits fell in the third quarter as it trimmed its holdings of both Apple and Bank of America. Berkshire reported third-quarter operating earnings of $10.1 billion, down from $10.7 billion a year ago and $11.6 billion in the prior quarter. It also reported a record level of cash holdings at $320.3 billion, up from $271.5 billion in the second quarter. The Warren Buffet-led company also said it had paused share buybacks. Berkshire Hathaway shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Apple and Bank of America also traded lower. Chipmaker Nvidia will replace rival semiconductor manufacturer Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while paint producer Sherwin-Williams will also join the blue-chip index in place of chemical firm Dow. S&P Dow Jones Indices said the changes to the index will come before the start of trading on Friday, Nov. 8. Nvidia’s inclusion in the index comes as its share price has surged on demand for artificial intelligence (AI), while Intel’s shares have lost more than half of their value this year. Shares of Nvidia traded higher by more than 2% in premarket trading, while Sherwin-Williams shares gained more than 4%. Shares of both Intel and Dow traded lower. Palantir Technologies shares were more than 1% lower ahead of the software provider's third-quarter earnings report, due after markets close today. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha are projecting that Palantir will grow its revenue by 26% in the quarter to $704.9 million, while its expected earnings per share of 5 cents would be up from 3 cents per share a year earlier. Shares of Palantir are up nearly 40% since September, but of the 12 analysts covering Palantir, only two projected a further rise in the company’s shares, with the average price target of $27.55 coming in 34% lower than its Friday closing price. Shares of Boeing edged higher in premarket trading ahead of a vote today by the aerospace giant’s machinist union that could end the strike that has lasted nearly two months. The International Association of Machinists will vote on the new offer from Boeing that includes 38% pay increases, along with a ratification bonus that workers can elect to use as part of their retirement savings. The union rejected a previous offer from Boeing that included a 35% pay hike, extending the strike that began on Sept. 13. Boeing recently raised around $19 billion in stock and depositary share sales as the company looks to shore up its finances.

Title: Big Tech is spending eye-watering amounts on AI

Good morning. We’re 24 hours away from Election Day in the United States. Is anyone concerned about someone hacking the vote?According to a recent Pew Research survey of more than 5,000 American adults, the answer depends heavily on a person’s party affiliation.Fifty-two percent of voters are “at least somewhat confident” that U.S. election systems are secure from tech threats like hacking, according to the survey. A whopping 73% of Harris supporters are confident in that security—20 percentage points higher than Biden backers in 2020, no less. Yet a mere 32% of Trump supporters feel similarly, way down from 60% four years ago. A silver lining? Most voters, regardless of party affiliation, believe local poll workers and state election officials will do a good job during the election. Phew. —Andrew NuscaP.S. AT&T CEO John Stankey will discuss the future of U.S. infrastructure at Fortune Global Forum next week, Nov. 11-12 in New York City. Interested? Request an invitation here. Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. The ROI of AI? Perhaps the single most pressing question in tech outside of who might occupy the Oval Office next year. Now that some of the world’s largest tech companies have shared their latest earnings, it’s clear the question is far from answered. The capital spending of four of the biggest U.S. tech companies—Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft—will likely top $200 billion this year, with little relief planned for 2025. Data centers are materializing. Power agreements are arising. Acquisitions are accelerating. It’s giving gold rush, as the kids say—and Wall Street is a little freaked out that ambitions are outpacing potential returns. (That is: “Delulu.”) On the final day of October trading last week, investors sold off enough tech stock to drive U.S. stock indices down and erase all of the gains they made that month. Microsoft shares dropped 6%, its largest one-day drop in years. Meta shares fell 4%. “This … is maybe not what investors want to hear in the near term, that we’re growing it out,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during a conference call. “But I just think that the opportunities here are really big.” To find solid ground, investors are looking at more tangible components of the revolution, such as semiconductor sales. But concerns remain. For example, even as Microsoft disclosed an annualized $10 billion in AI revenue, it acknowledged that rising costs and slowing growth would eat into its cash cow in the cloud. Funding the revolution might just be more challenging than fomenting it. —AN In the world of blue-chip stocks, one day you’re in, and the next day you’re out. (At least that’s what Heidi Klum might say if she were a day trader.) Nvidia, riding the AI boom that has proven so lucrative for the chipmaker, is set to replace semiconductor peer Intel on the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average. The swap will be in place for trading on Friday, Nov. 8. The DJIA, which comprises 30 large companies, is among Wall Street’s oldest indices. It remains a powerful signal of success even if it has been criticized over the years for being too narrow to properly reflect sweeping economic changes. Intel joined the Dow in 1999, the same year as Microsoft; the pair were the first Nasdaq stocks ever chosen for the Dow. (It also happens to be the same year that Nvidia made its IPO for $12 per share. Ah, hindsight.) At the turn of the millennium, IBM and HP complemented the new additions to make four tech components to the Dow; today you’d be hard-pressed to find a firm that wasn’t trying to be in the tech category. —AN Big Tech peers Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have raced to sign agreements with nuclear power plants in a bid to fuel their energy-hungry AI datacenters. On Friday, one of them hit a major hurdle. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a petition to connect a colocated Amazon Web Services (AWS) data center directly to Talen Energy's Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Berwick, Pennsylvania. The agreement, which would have increased the facility’s load capacity from 300 megawatts to 480 megawatts and diverted power from the regional grid, “could have huge ramifications for both grid reliability and consumer costs,” said Commissioner Mark Christie in a statement. (Talen responded by saying that the decision “will have a chilling effect on economic development.”) The U.S. government and industry seem to be aligned that the development of artificial intelligence is a matter of national security; what’s still to be worked out is who will shoulder the burden. Watch this space. —AN Chinese researchers have created a military AI tool based on Meta’s “open-source” Llama 2 13B large language model, according to Reuters. Meta’s claim that its Llama AI models are “open-source” is hugely controversial, because of its licensing restrictions and the fact that it doesn’t reveal the source of the training data. But that doesn’t change the fact that Meta is making its models available for free, along with the parameters (“weights”) that make it easier to customize them. Per Reuters, that’s what these Chinese researchers have done, creating a model called ChatBIT that can aid military decision-makers and intelligence officers. Meta’s licensing restrictions forbid using Llama in military contexts, but what’s the company going to do? This is sure to inflame the debate over whether “open-source” AI is such a bright idea after all. —David Meyer Ming-Chi Kuo, the TF International Securities analyst known for having a reliable line on Apple’s supply chain, says an affordable Apple Vision Pro is further out than you’d think. “Production of the cheaper Vision Pro has been delayed beyond 2027 for a while now,” he posted Sunday on X, the social media service. “This means Apple's only new head-mounted display device in 2025 will be the Vision Pro with an upgraded M5 processor.” Apple’s $3,500 “spatial computer” was announced in June 2023 and hit the market nine months ago. Though most reviewers found the augmented reality device to be awe-inducing, they just as frequently found it impractical for real-world use. Estimates by IDC in July said Apple would fail to end the year with more than 500,000 units sold. According to Kuo, that’s part of why this delay might be acceptable to Apple. “Simply reducing the price wouldn't help create successful use cases,” he wrote. “It's similar to the HomePod situation—even after launching the cheaper HomePod mini, Apple's smart speakers failed to become mainstream products.” —AN —Elon Musk can’t dismiss ex-Twitter CEO’s severance claim. Parag Agarwal may proceed, a judge rules. —The CHIPS Act hasn’t seen much action. $33b approved; $123m awarded. —Peloton’s new CEO is a Ford and Apple veteran. Two words: Digital services. —Is awkward Alexa-speak not long for this world? Amazon is reorienting its famous assistant around LLMs. —Steve Ballmer wants to improve democracy with data.

Hello, the hour of reckoning has arrived for the new leader of the free world, and naturally, this week, something quite dramatic would need to happen to shift the spotlight from this major event that occurs once every four years and politically, geostrategically, and economically impacts the whole world. Judging by the polls and predictions on both sides, we may find out the winner more than 48 hours after the polls close, though any forecast could simply end up being guesswork. We… – Now, as for us as a country, it doesn’t take a genius to see we’d prefer the Democrats and Kamala, though it’s neither in our hands nor the end of the world if things don’t go that way. After all, there are ties and balances, and our relationship with the U.S. has strengthened more than ever over the past few years, aided by the dynamic presence of Ambassador Tsounis. We shall see. An interesting week is dawning. In Athens… – In Athens, the government is currently occupied with various important, though not earth-shattering, governance issues. Meanwhile, bizarre tales, straight out of Latin America, are coming to light and have become the talk of the town. You might say it’s the old story of “same old, same old” in Greece. Another thing Greece has “always had” – and something this administration, as well as K.M. himself, will also have to deal with – is the wear and tear of a second term. This includes inevitable signs of arrogance, along with increasingly bold and demanding oligarchs and special interests. And naturally, the “regular” folks, whether businesspeople or media tycoons who aren’t asking for money or power, are fewer and fewer and are likely running low on patience. This calls for special caution, because, as we’ve seen before, internal opponents play a role here, and in this instance, some of them are even the same people. For example, Samaras, who toppled Constantine Mitsotakis’ government, wouldn’t hesitate to take down Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ administration if he could. Now, I don’t know if he has enough MPs at his Sunday gatherings, allegedly eating souvlaki and plotting (LOL), or if he could align with Karamanlis’ group, though the Rafina resident is more restrained and less impulsive than Antonis, who some say might even be angling for an interim prime minister role. Though personally, I’m not sure who or what this transition would be for. At any rate, there are eager oligarchs ready to lend support, and let’s not forget the opposition, which now includes Nikos Androulakis, who is flexible and notably open to media support and more. Well, the man is just doing his job, and if he manages to stabilize at 20% or higher, he’ll certainly be playing in the big leagues. Cabinet Reshuffle – Maximos Mansion – Schinas – Thus, the next big topic already buzzing in political offices and business salons around Athens is the upcoming cabinet reshuffle, which will most likely happen after the presidential election, in three months, meaning “wait and see,” especially with K.M., who not only keeps his cards close but also recalibrates based on timing, especially for reshuffles. One juicy tidbit I heard (amid other whispers of people rejoining the government, which has become somewhat cliché) concerns former Commissioner Margaritis Schinas. Rumor has it that Margaritis, now back in his hometown of Thessaloniki, is gearing up for a powerful ministerial position, possibly even as Foreign Minister, replacing Gerapetritis if K.M. decides to bring him back to Maximos Mansion – something that doesn’t seem all that far-fetched. Again, I emphasize that this is just information and not a “guarantee,” as we used to say, since there are still more than three months before any reshuffle. Kasselakis Sr. – Legal Troubles – As for developments in SYRIZA, while we’re all following them, they no longer have that freshness; they’re not “juicy” anymore. Still, here’s an interesting piece of news related to the democracy champion Stefanos. Today, the Council of State (sixth chamber, if I’m not mistaken) is hearing the case of Kasselakis’ father, who famously owes €11.5 million in taxes. This debt stems from an old issue regarding a villa he owned in Ekali, which the SDOE tax investigation agency found was owned by him via an offshore company, leading to significant penalties. Given that the five-member council had upheld prior rulings from lower courts (first-instance and appellate), it’s likely that today’s seven-member council will reach the same conclusion as the previous judges. Nevertheless, he has his day in court, so we wish him “good luck.” Only Two Portfolios Stick to the Business Plan – The red loan market is facing substantial challenges. At the Ministry of Finance, there’s a report by KPMG on the Hercules scheme, which notes that only two NPL portfolios – Frontier and Galaxy in the corporate sector – are progressing according to the business plan. All other portfolios are facing issues ranging from minor to major. Simultaneously, secondary market transactions have slowed down, Intrum has agreed on prices for the sale of seven portfolios but has yet to close the deal, discussions are underway for acquisitions between servicers, even major ones, and the market is generally getting tougher and more demanding. It’s only a matter of time before we see restructuring moves that will lead to stronger entities managing the next phase of red-loan liquidations. PPC enters a new business sector – Establishes “PPC INSPECTRA” – PPC is embarking on a new venture, with its management setting up an independent subsidiary following the operational split of its existing Laboratories, Certification, and Inspection Department (DEPE). The goal of spinning off this division and forming a new company called “PPC INSPECTRA” is to accelerate the expansion of DEPE’s activities (which would be difficult to achieve through organic growth alone) and to penetrate more effectively into the Laboratory Services, Inspection, and Certification (Testing, Inspection & Certification – TIC) market, where demand is high. Strategically, the aim is for the new company to become the preferred TIC provider and offer all the services required by clients in this market (a one-stop shop). Establishing this new subsidiary is the main topic of today’s extraordinary shareholders’ meeting, which is expected to give the green light. Additionally, it’s noted that with the spin-off, DEPE will be able to acquire and integrate other businesses operating in related fields, expand its client base, and grow geographically. This move is favored by the conditions in the Greek TIC market, which is highly fragmented, with the top three companies (Bureau Veritas, DNV, TUV Hellas) collectively holding a 30% market share, while more than 350 smaller firms operate in this space. Notably, DEPE has been part of the former Innovation Center (DKK) and the earlier Center for Testing, Research & Standards (KDEP), and has been providing testing services to PPC’s units and external clients for over 50 years. Since the project is already well underway, DEPE has applied for certification as an Accredited Certification Body from the National Accreditation System (ESYD). The Golden Dividend of… Retired Executives – The Sarantis brothers, Michalis and Takis, might now call themselves “retirees,” having handed over the leadership of the Hellenic Dairies Group (Olympus, Rodopi, Agno, Kliafas, Tyras, etc.) to their children a few months ago. However, they still have a say in strategic decisions and continue to reap the rewards of their years of hard work. This year, they are set to receive a “golden dividend” of nearly 6 million euros. The group is expected to surpass 600 million euros in revenue and 100 million euros in EBITDA this year. In terms of net profitability, based on the decision to distribute dividends, performance is expected to be remarkable, especially when compared to competitors who are now lagging behind. The Rothschild & Co Greece Headache – Rothschild & Co, the prominent investment bank with an expanded presence in Greece in recent years, appears to have a “headache.” Five years ago, it evolved from a simple office into a full-fledged subsidiary called Rothschild & Co Greece S.A. Last year, Marios Broustas was appointed CEO, while the long-time head of the Greek office, Nasos Zabaras, took on the role of Chairman. The subsidiary aims to make a stronger push into the M&A advisory sector, hoping to fulfill the ambitions set by its parent company, as, so far, the balance sheet isn’t exactly thriving. Official reports show a reduced turnover in 2023 of approximately 862,000 euros, with pre-tax losses of 900,000 euros and after-tax losses of 748,000 euros. The company raised its share capital by 2 million euros to reach 2.025 million euros and also received a 1 million euro loan from the parent company via an open credit line. Consequently, its equity turned positive, reaching 726,666 euros, although its working capital (current liabilities minus current assets) remained negative. It’s worth noting that the company has secured a commitment from its ultimate shareholder to provide financial support over the next 12 months to ensure uninterrupted operations. The Surprise – At year’s end, the Ministry of Finance plans a “surprise”: a General State Balance Sheet with almost zero deficit. This means Greece will not only present a primary surplus of 3% to cover interest and debt payments but also a general surplus, having serviced its loans. Many in the Ministry suggest using this surplus to repurchase high-interest loans from the past, thereby dramatically reducing both debt service costs and nominal debt. As major European economies (France, Italy, Spain) dangerously increase their public debt, Greece stands out as a fiscally disciplined economy that reduces its debt and grows at twice the EU average. This is the picture that Finance Minister K. Hatzidakis will present at today’s Eurogroup meeting. The next challenge is for all Greek households to feel this unprecedented fiscal improvement, a goal pursued by the new tax reform bill entering public consultation today. Why They Are Buying EYDAP and EYATH – The government has launched a large-scale water management project with EYDAP leading in the South and EYATH in the North. Inevitably, these major investments and changes will bring new pricing. The implementation has begun, with the new “Regulated Asset Base” (RAB) framework published a month ago, increasing assets by 30% over the current level. Institutional investors are already taking notice, systematically buying shares of EYDAP and EYATH. Despite a declining stock market, EYDAP gained +1.4% last month, reaching a capitalization of 612 million euros with 4,705 trades involving 713,000 shares. EYATH, the “smaller, more conservative” entity, maintains a capitalization of 117 million euros, with 52,316 shares changing hands within the month. Brigadier General Evangelos Mytilineos – Metlen Energy & Metals sponsored the renovation of the 7th Company building at the Hellenic Military Academy. The group’s subsidiary, ELEMKA, fully renovated 2,500 square meters of facilities, upgrading cadet dormitories, common areas, and improving energy efficiency. At the official opening ceremony, President Katerina Sakellaropoulou awarded Evangelos Mytilineos the honorary title of Brigadier General, along with a commemorative statuette and ceremonial sword from the Academy. “Black Friday” Turns Into “Black November” – Traditionally in the U.S., “Black Friday” falls on the last Friday of November, right after Thanksgiving, when retailers clear out old stock at huge discounts to make room for new inventory. In Greece, however, Black Friday has turned into “Black Week” and now “Black November.” Major chains, led by Public, have already started sales, with Kotsovolos announcing a major event at the Mall this week. All stores are launching offers since the usual mid-November sales won’t take place, while retailers aim to secure early holiday spending that consumers will receive in late December. What Buffett Fears—and Expects – Warren Buffett, the “Oracle of Omaha” and renowned contrarian investor, didn’t buy a single stock during the third quarter. As American markets hit record highs and Wall Street experiences a buying frenzy, Berkshire Hathaway has continued to sell stocks, pushing its cash reserves to an unprecedented 325.2 billion dollars. Even with Apple—the market cap leader heading toward 4 trillion dollars—Berkshire has reduced its position, selling 14.3 billion dollars’ worth, leaving its stake at 69.9 billion dollars, or 25% lower than the previous quarter. In total, over the past two quarters, Buffett sold Apple shares worth 100 billion dollars. While selling stocks, Berkshire has simultaneously increased its holdings in U.S. Treasury Bills to 288 billion dollars. Those who view Buffett as a “wise investor” and follow his strategy closely may face a tough week ahead on Wall Street. Not All IT is Golden – Twenty-five years ago, in November 1999, at the peak of the dot-com bubble, Intel was added to the Dow Jones Index as a sign that “IT is the future.” Back then, Intel traded at 42.25 dollars. If someone had invested 10,000 dollars in Intel stock at that time, their investment today would be worth around 5,500 dollars (plus any dividends received). Today, Intel is being removed from the Dow Jones Index, replaced by the well-known Nvidia. Nvidia’s shares have surged +180% this year as tech giants demand its high-powered processors that fuel AI, the technology now seen as the future. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, created by Charles Dow in 1896, is a beacon for the U.S. stock market. Unlike the S&P 500, which weights companies by market capitalization, the 30-stock Dow Jones is price-weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have more impact. This is why the Dow Jones includes stocks like Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce, and Cisco Systems, while companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta are absent.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Collective fear stimulates herd instinct and tends to produce ferocity toward those who are not regarded as members of the herd.” — Bertrand Russell, Unpopular Essays Number of the Week: 95% THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week discusses the complexity of the sun and part of what we do not know. It presents the abstract of a paper by Donald Rapp who is concerned about rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Also discussed are the false notion of settled science, questionable classification of subsidies, rising electricity rates in the US, the use of the term unprecedented, and the questionable optimism of a recent report by the IEA, ********************* The Mysterious Sun: The Sun and the relationship between Earth and Sun are the dominant characteristics of climate change. According to the mathematical model developed by Serbian mathematician Milutin Milankovitch three types of cyclical patterns describe how the Earth revolves around the Sun: According to a NASA website, each cycle has a different duration. Changes in eccentricity vary between 0.0034 (almost a perfect circle) to 0.058 (slightly elliptical) and the duration is 100,000 years. The eccentricity explains why seasons are different lengths. In the Northen Hemisphere summers are longer than winters. Changes in obliquity, tilt, are described as 41,000-year cycles. The tilt varies between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees from a North Pole – South Pole axis. And changes in the direction Earth’s axis is pointed (a wobble) is described as a 26,000-year cycle. According to the NASA Science Editorial Team. “Milankovitch’s work was supported by other researchers of his time, and he authored numerous publications on his hypothesis. But it wasn’t until about 10 years after his death in 1958 that the global science community began to take serious notice of his theory. In 1976, a study in the journal Science by Hays et al. using deep-sea sediment cores found that Milankovitch cycles correspond with periods of major climate change over the past 450,000 years, with Ice Ages occurring when Earth was undergoing different stages of orbital variation. Several other projects and studies have also upheld the validity of Milankovitch’s work, including research using data from ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica that has provided strong evidence of Milankovitch cycles going back many hundreds of thousands of years. In addition, his work has been embraced by the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Scientific research to better understand the mechanisms that cause changes in Earth’s rotation and how specifically Milankovitch cycles combine to affect climate is ongoing. But the theory that they drive the timing of glacial-interglacial cycles is well accepted.” Many researchers have proposed that not well understood changes in the Sun influence Earth’s climate in terms of years and decades. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its collaborators dismiss changes in the Sun as insignificant. The private CERES-Science team proposes that Sun’s energy has changed over the last 45 years in a paper published by the Astrophysical Journal: “Multiple New or Updated Satellite Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) Composites (1978–2023).” The CERES-Science team has posted the entire dataset. The entire dataset is often missing in some of the critical work that the IPCC uses such as the Mann, et al. hockey-stick. The abstract of the CERES-Science paper reads: Several total solar irradiance (TSI) satellite missions have been carried out since 1978. None of these missions have lasted more than one to two solar cycles (SCs), and each mission implies a slightly different absolute TSI baseline. Nonetheless, several satellite composites have been developed by compositing satellite data from different missions to form an almost continuous daily record for the satellite era. However, disconcertingly, each mission has implied slightly different changes in TSI between consecutive solar minima and solar maxima. Some groups have developed adjustments to individual missions that have substantially reduced these differences. Others prefer to use the original data published by the satellite science teams. Some TSI composites average together conflicting records, while others prioritize specific records over others. Here, we compare four existing composites to 17 new alternative series based on the available satellite data. These 21 TSI series are statistically sorted into six groups of three to four series each. We found that the six groups suggest different intercycle trends between solar minima. We compare the groups to eight daily resolved solar proxy-based TSI reconstructions and to daily sunspot numbers. Excellent agreement is obtained over one to two SCs, but significant differences are observed over longer timescales for each group. Therefore, we have assembled all these time series (old and new) into a large and new TSI data set for use by the scientific community. Versions scaled to 1 au (for studying solar variability) or in situ values at Earth (for studying solar/terrestrial interactions) are provided at daily, monthly, and yearly resolutions. The principal author, Ronan Connolly, has posted a video explaining this work. He explains that there are three hypotheses regarding sunspots and Total Solar Irradiance (TSI): Connolly concludes that based on satellite measurements all three are partly right and partly wrong. Generally, for one year data, the higher the sunspot number the lower the TSI. For ten-year data, the higher the sunspot number the higher the TSI. This paradox illustrates the complexity of the issue, and the need to examine all the solid data available and not limit the examination to specific time periods. Adding to the complexity is that occurrence of large bright areas on the sun accompanying small dark sunspots. These cannot be observed with ordinary method because the sun is too bright and can only be observed when dark lenses are used. The bright regions are called solar plages or bright floccule or chromospheric faculae. The chromosphere (sphere of color) is the second layer of the sun’s atmosphere above photosphere (the outer shell from which light is radiated) and below the solar transition region and the corona (the outmost layer). Connolly asserts bright floccule (solar plages) accompanying sunspots increase TSI more than the sunspots decrease TSI. Does the bright floccule, sunspot activity and TSI relationship remain the same over most solar cycles? We don’t know. This has been an ongoing debate since the late 1990s. There appear to be two different solar cycles and the TSI is different in each solar minimum. However, relying on the sunspot record is not good enough, and an increase in TSI may contribute to global warming. Further, the shortage of data from the satellite record is a problem prior to 1996. The question is which record since 1996 is most reliable because each satellite record shows slightly different behavior. There have been different types of adjustments to the satellite data with the adjusted data known as the PMOD adjustments showing almost an exact linear relationship between sunspots and TSI from 1978 to 2013. This adjustment requires a correction to the Nimbus 7 data for the instruments to become more sensitive. Douglas Hoyt, head of the Nimbus 7 team, stated that the Nimbus team was unable to find any physical change to justify the adjustment or any change in the method of calculating the results. (The abstract of one of his papers can be found at: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/91JA02488 Connolly discusses that the CERES-Science team provides a new way to look at satellite data – updating past composites and providing additional ones to bring the total to 21. They brought them into six separate groups and calculated the average of these six groups. Five groups are significantly different than one group close to the PMOD calculations which the IPCC uses. The principle researcher of PMOD is now dead and Connolly is reluctant to directly address the methods of calculation because the principle researcher cannot reply. From the work of the CERES-Science team, one can appreciation how complex it is to understand the changing complexity of the principle driver of Earth’s climate. To say the science of Earth’s climate is settled is absurd. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Concern about CO2: Donald Rapp is an accomplished physicist. According to his biography on Amazon, Rapp has: “over 60 years of technical research experience. He was a full professor at the University of Texas and spent over 30 years at Caltech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In his early career he worked in chemical physics, producing a dozen citation classics with up to a thousand citations, and textbooks on quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. Later, he worked on spacecraft technology leading to his book “Human Missions to Mars”. Since about 2006 he has worked mainly on climate change, ice ages and human missions to Mars. His positions on many key issues are contrary to mainstream trends. In particular, he is highly doubtful that life ever existed on Mars and thinks the NASA Mars Program is a boondoggle. He is also skeptical of alarmist claims regarding the dangers of global warming, but he is concerned about rising CO2. At age 88, he is still going strong with a new book coming out in February 2023.” The fourth edition of his book Assessing Climate Change: Temperatures, Solar Radiation and Heat Balance was published in November 2016. Donald Rapp informed Ken Haapala that his new paper addresses current climate change: “Estimate of Temperature Rise in the 21st Century for Various Scenarios.” The abstract reads: “The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a lengthy report on climate change in early 2023. This report hypothesizes five potential scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 to the end of the century (2100) and estimates the global average temperature gain in the year 2100 from the mid-1800s for each scenario. The method of calculation in the IPCC report is obscure. The results are merely stated. The present paper provides a clear method for estimating the temperature gain each year from 2015 until 2100, along with yearly estimates of ppm of CO2. To facilitate the calculations, a set of scenarios of future emissions was chosen that is analogous to the scenarios used by the IPCC but is more amenable to computation. The basic assumption in this paper is that most of the temperature gain from the mid-1800s to 2015 (1.15 C – as reported by the IPCC) was due to rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and a relationship is thereby derived between warming and gigatons of CO2 emitted for the period: 1800s to 2015. If it is assumed that the amount of warming per gigaton CO2 from the past persists into the 21st century, then future warming in the 21st century can be estimated for any assumed future scenario of CO2 emissions. This paper provides a simple and clear estimate of yearly CO2 ppm and temperature rise from 2015 to 2100 since the 1800s for a set of scenarios that cover the likely range of future emissions.” An honest scientist, Rapp states the key assumption: “The basic assumption in this paper is that most of the temperature gain from the mid-1800s to 2015 (1.15 C – as reported by the IPCC) was due to rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and a relationship is thereby derived between warming and gigatons of CO2 emitted for the period: 1800s to 2015.” To TWTW the lack of comprehensive data and the tremendous uncertainties involved make it impossible to test this key assumption. The uncertainties and the inability to test key assumptions in the many assertions involved in climate change are the principle reasons why TWTW focuses so heavily on understanding the greenhouse effect, even though it evolves a field of physics that is distant from classical physics. As discussed in last week’s TWTW, the scale and dimensions involved are far different. The issue is important because fossil fuels which increase atmospheric CO2 are needed for reliable, affordable electricity. Perhaps one day they may be replaced by nuclear energy, even fusion. But that day is not today. For Rapp’s accomplished paper, see link under Defending the Orthodoxy; for last week’s discussion of importance of scale see https://www.sepp.org/twtwfiles/2024/TWTW%2010-26-2024.pdf *************** Settled Science? One of the exaggerations made by climate alarmist is that the science is “settled.” Charles Rotter of WUWT points out a new paper that terrestrial plants absorb 31% more CO2 than previously calculated. Rotter writes: “The discovery that plants absorb 31% more CO₂ than we thought reveals just how far off the mark climate models—and the policies based on them—can be. It’s not just a matter of revising a few numbers; it’s about rethinking the entire narrative of ‘settled science.’” If verified, this will require a recalculation for the “settled science.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** What Are Subsidies? Proponents of wind and solar have long claimed massive subsidies to fossil fuels and often included dubious arguments that the depletion allowance is one such subsidy. The depletion allowance is similar to depreciation of an asset, they both lessen the value of the asset. Writing for the UK Daily Sceptic David Turver provides a solid economic analysis of what is a subsidy and what is not. He states: “In simple terms, a subsidy is when the Government pays (or mandates consumers to pay) for an activity to occur that otherwise would not happen if the market were left to its own devices. Examples might include grants to theatre companies or awarding CfD [Contract for Difference] contracts to offshore wind. When it comes to oil and gas, the definition of a subsidy becomes a little controversial. The International Energy Agency (IEA) defines fossil fuel subsidies as ‘measures that reduce the effective price of fossil fuels below world market prices.’ It is certainly true that some countries, such as Russia and Iran, do subsidize hydrocarbons according to the IEA’s definition.” Turver provides a graph by IEA showing the Value of fossil-fuel subsidies by fuel in the top 25 countries, 2022. The US, UK, and Germany do not appear. Leading the list are Russia, Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Turver provides an analysis comparing UK Fossil Fuel “Subsidies” and Taxes [paid] 2022. This shows the subsides amount to about 24.8 billion pounds while the taxes amount to about 49.8 billion pounds. In 2024 the expected subsidies are about 0.2 billion pounds while the taxes are expected to be about the same. It would be interesting to see such an analysis for the US, particularly the subsidies to solar and wind power compared to the taxes paid. For California, the results would be ridiculous, especially if the value of electricity, delivered or not delivered, is also calculated. On summer sunny days solar power in California often generates more power than needed and nothing in the evening when needed the most. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Rising Electricity Costs: Writing for Master Resource, Bill Peacock gives a grim analysis of rising electricity costs in the US, by grid sectors. He writes: “During the first three years under Biden vs. last three under Trump, average wholesale electric prices in the seven U.S. independent or regional service areas have increased by 72%. Retail prices are also higher. The average 2024 U.S. residential rate to date is 24% higher than in 2020. For all end users—residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors—prices are up 23%. This rate surge reflects the massive renewable energy subsidies authorized in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, signed by President Biden, which tripled the outlay of such federal largesse. Another factor is the administration’s natural gas policies, which banned imports of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal; joined with the European Commission to reduce Europe’s dependance on Russian oil; and put a pause on LNG permits. Natural gas combined cycle, the technology of choice in a free market, is as cheap as ever, representing the path not taken. Whether it is the unprecedented subsidies for renewable energy or the unprecedented war on American energy, the Biden administration’s policies are behind the increase in America’s electricity prices. Wholesale Prices Up 72% Wholesale electricity prices are the best indicator of the direction of electricity prices. State regulations on retail prices often shield consumers from immediate exposure to rising energy prices. Eventually, though, consumers will bear the full brunt of higher wholesale electricity costs either through higher retail electric prices, lower income, or higher prices for other goods and services.” “ERCOT, which covers most of Texas, had the highest average wholesale price over the last three years at $117. It also had the highest three-year increase at 208%. ISO New England had the second highest average price at $81, followed by California ISO at $80. CAISO also had the second highest three-year price increase at 81%. New York ISO was next averaging $68, although prices in New York City were considerably higher at $80.” Peacock gives a table showing estimates of U.S. Federal Energy Subsidies, 2020-2029: Renewables $244,874,000,000; Fossil Fuels, 22,474,000,000; Nuclear $19,116,000,000. He then states that: “From 2010 through 2019, solar received $82 per megawatt hour of electricity generated. That is 42 times the amount of subsidies per megawatt hour nuclear received, 112 times coal, and 211 times oil and gas. For wind, its multiples were 10 times nuclear, 26 times coal, and 48 times oil and gas. The ‘free’ wind and solar generation actually cost taxpayers $74 billion last decade in federal subsidies, without including the cost of the electricity or state and local subsidies.” This analysis shows the government subsidies to wind and solar are not the path to reliable, affordable electricity. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Unprecedented: A characteristic of yellow journalism and climate propaganda is the use of the term “unprecedented.” Heavy rains fell in the Valencia region of Spain, and immediately mainstream media shrieked “unprecedented.” The volume of water involved was not unprecedented, but due to human settlement in flood plains and increasing prosperity, the loss of human life and property may have been. According to an article in Reuters, the phenomenon known locally as DANA may have been the cause. DANA is a Spanish acronym for high-altitude isolated depression, and unlike common storms or squalls it can form independently of polar or subtropical jet streams. See links under Changing Weather. *************** Optimism v. Reality: The International Energy Agency (IEA) came out with the World Energy Outlook 2024 that TWTW finds unrealistic in assessing the replacement of fossil fuels with alternatives such as wind and solar. Among other issues, the problems of the unreliability of wind and solar have not been addressed. Storage of electricity is a vexing problem, and the only proven large scale storage is pumped hydro replenished by reliable fossil fuel or nuclear generation. Batteries for storage of electricity is tiny compared with the enormity of the scale needed, and replenishment of the stored electricity is seldom mentioned. Paul Homewood mentions a good critique by Art Berman “IEA Optimism vs. Reality: The Contradictions in the Energy Transition.” After presenting a number of factual issues and graphs Berman concludes: “The IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2024 offers an optimistic view of a smooth transition to renewables. This is at odds, however, with the realities of energy consumption, economic growth, and the hard limits of ecosystem capacity. Despite decades of investment, fossil fuel consumption remains stubbornly high, and expectations for renewables to sustain comparable economic growth are idealistic. The IEA and many renewable energy advocates ignore the fundamental problem of ‘overshoot’—the reality that human consumption has already surpassed the planet’s ecological limits. The optimistic projection for a renewable energy future reflects an inadequate understanding of the past and present. The idea that renewables can sustain continued economic growth without addressing the underlying issue of excessive resource use is dangerously naive. Economic expansion requires more than just cleaner energy—it demands vast material inputs and energy yields that renewables, in their current form, struggle to provide. By focusing only on decarbonization, these projections overlook the deeper challenge: a growth-based system incompatible with planetary boundaries. Until the obsession with endless growth and consumption is confronted, energy forecasts, no matter how green they appear, will remain built on wishful thinking.” See links under Questioning the Orthodoxy *************** Number of the Week: 95% In “#CheerfulCharts #13: US sulfur dioxide trends” links to and EPA chart: US Sulfur Dioxide Trends: National Tends. All regions of the US are below the minimum National Standard. This actual pollutant used to be a big problem in urban air in North America and Europe, but improved technology scrubbed from smokestacks and automobile exhaust, getting it out of the exhaust before it even got into the air we breathe. This is a success story for the EPA. Unfortunately, the EPA has gone on to disgrace its reputation by embracing the linear no-threshold model by regulating most amounts of particles in the air that are 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter PM2.5. But more egregiously. EPA has declared carbon dioxide, which is essential for photosynthesis, the source of food for all complex life, a pollutant. All without physical evidence of harm to humans. Further, EPA has declared all greenhouse gases are pollutants, but largely ignores the primary greenhouse gas, water vapor. Regulating water vapor is as far beyond the control of the EPA as regulating carbon dioxide emissions from China. See links under Questioning the Orthodoxy. Science: Is the Sun Rising?

Mind you, while COP28 attracted a widely ridiculed 85,000 participants (some 97,000 people registered so evidently there were a few thousand no-shows), with barely two weeks to go COP29 had only 32,000 registrants (including us). Social Benefits of Carbon Dioxide Oh nuts, more CO2 By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 30, 2024 CO2 Science archive Problems in the Orthodoxy This game is easy By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 30, 2024 But then you read a column by the New York Times’ marquee climate writer David Gelles that starts with a baffled “Cleaning up the technology industry was supposed to be easy” and you realize that the fate of humankind is, to a disquieting degree, in the hands of people who think practical difficulties are invented by the malicious to sabotage an outbreak of peace, plenty and harmony. How was cleaning up anything, let alone an industry that requires a lot of weird mineral inputs, going to be “easy”? And here you thought everyone was as absolutist as you are on the subject. But of course, a major part of the problem was the overall promise that getting to Net Zero wouldn’t just be easy, it would take less than no work because the greener we got the richer as well as cleaner we’d get. All because we trusted our future to people who had inexplicably reached adulthood without discovering the existence of practical difficulties.

John Christy will be retiring from UAH July 2026. Because my funding has been tied to his projects (including the Alabama Office of the State Climatologist, which he heads), there is a good chance I will also be retiring on or before that date.

Nothing new, this was true for the 20th century.] Oil and Natural Gas – the Future or the Past? The Generational Opportunity for U.S. LNG By Tristan Abbey, WUWT, Oct 29, 2024 Regulatory uncertainty means higher costs, longer and delayed timelines, and potentially disrupted supply chains. “Turning off” LNG exports would cause a cascading series of dislocations throughout the economy, not only in the export sector. It has taken the better part of a generation already to achieve the nation’s dominant position in natural gas. [SEPP Comment: In the 1970s Washington thought the US was running out of natural gas and the world out of oil, and President Carter thought coal was the fuel needed to avoid the oncoming crisis.] Return of King Coal? Standing Up to the Coal Killers By Duggan Flanakin, Real Clear Energy, Oct 29, 2024 Back in April the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) agreed on a time frame for phasing out coal-fired power plants in the first half of the 2030s. There was just one problem: Only the U.S. and Germany are among the world’s top ten coal consumers. The UN counts as members both China and India, which together consume nearly 70% of the world’s coal production. Neither is a member of the G7. Nor does the “bold” G7 commitment explain how their self-imposed coal ban – which they want to impose on poor African nations – even matters. Nuclear Energy and Fears Japan nuclear reactor near Fukushima to restart By AFP Staff Writers, Tokyo (AFP) Oct 29, 2024 Japan has been turning back to nuclear power in order to cut emissions, reduce expensive imports of fossil fuels and meet energy demand for data centres for artificial intelligence (AI). Safety and regulatory standards have been tightened since, and the Onagawa plant — cleared in 2020 to re-start — has increased the height of its anti-tsunami wall to 29 metres (95 feet) above sea level, one of the highest in Japan. Bill Gates’ Energy Group, Former Google CEO Investing in Pacific Fusion Startup By Darrell Proctor, Power Mag, The Series A funding is a phased approach. The entire $900 million is committed, but “only unlocked as the company achieves pre-defined milestones,” General Catalyst [the parent venture capital firm] said. Pacific Fusion wrote that the company’s immediate foal is “Net facility gain. We are using these resources to build a high gain pulsed magnetic fusion driver to achieve ‘net facility gain’. [more fusion energy output than all stored energy input].

Unfortunately, while each had a section on grid battery fires there was significant confusion as each cited a regulation that as I read it does not apply to grid scale battery complexes. Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Vehicles Electric Vehicles: A Tale of Woe in the Absence of the Market Process By Timothy G. Nash & Jason Hayes, Tom Rastin, Real Clear Energy, Oct 31, 2024 Milton Friedman explained that “market processes” allow individuals to interact and exchange goods and services voluntarily. The prices they charge in these exchanges guide production and consumption decisions, ultimately leading to the most efficient resource allocations, maximized customer satisfaction, and increased purchasing power, and this all occurs with minimal need for government interference. [SEPP Comment: Is voluntarily in Washington’s vocabulary? Ford Lost Another $1.2 Billion in 3Q On EVs FoMoCo lost $58,391 for every EV it sold during the quarter. By Robert Bryce, His Blog, Oct 28, 2024 ‘Why did our parked electric car burst into flames?’ By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 27, 2024 The one percenters By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 30, 2024 OK, to be fair, the city of Calgary, in progressive hands, launched an ambitious half-billion-of-other-people’s-dollars plan to the municipal vehicle fleet to electric and show those short-sighted private-sector fools what real efficiency looks like. And how did it go? Oh. Awkward. The suppliers of 14 “emissions-free, 28-foot shuttle buses” to be delivered in 2022 instead went… bankrupt. So they leaped into committee, preparing to draft a scheme for a plan to devise a call for bids by year-end for a handful of buses to arrive in 2026, or on the 14th of never. Electric bin lorry bursts into flames in central London By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 28, 2024 From article: “Specialist crews were deployed to the fire after the £580,000 electric lorry caught alight in the morning. The lithium battery-powered trucks were recently launched under Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, as part of a green initiative to reduce carbon emissions in the capital.” [SEPP Comment: In the US, a new trash truck goes for $200,000 to $350,000 or less than £460,00.] Carbon Schemes A Bit Of Perspective Goes A Long Way By Willis Eschenbach, WUWT, Oct 31, 2024 California Dreaming Newsom signs executive order to curb electricity costs for Californians By Sharon Udasin, The Hill, Oct 31, 2024 [SEPP Comment: How, grow cucumbers for sunbeams to create solar power at night?] Gas price fears drive pushback against California plan to overhaul climate program By Sharon Udasin, The Hill, Oct 29, 2024 All 12 of the Golden State’s U.S. House members sent a letter on Friday to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), urging the agency to delay a decision that they believe would cause undue pain at the pump. The vote is scheduled for Nov. 8, just three days after the national elections. Ways California Can Have Abundant Water By Edward Ring, What’s Current, Accessed Oct 30, 2024 A few years ago, a group of volunteers, myself included, attempted to qualify a state ballot initiative called “The Water Infrastructure Funding Act.” Those of us involved with this project remain convinced that had it qualified for the ballot and been approved by voters, it would have solved water scarcity in California forever.

Which has a certain logic to it, although if he had any research staff, they might have warned him that “stand and deliver!” was “said in the past by highwaymen when they stopped a carriage… to demand objects of value from the travelers” until America’s colorful hillbilly culture gave us the phrase “Reach for the sky” instead. So, a threat not outreach, albeit one he might not be very well placed to carry through on. The Death of the Lamp Post By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 28, 2024 Another step back to the Dark Ages. Tidbits By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 30, 2024 The government of Canada, apparently flush with borrowed cash, tells us “The communities of Shelburne and Barton will have 13 new, energy efficient, homes after an investment of more than $5.1 million from the federal and provincial governments and Co-operative Homes Ltd. (Compass Nova Scotia).” And while we hate to do math in the midst of a spending blitz, including on the size of our national debt and interest payments on same, if it really takes over $5 million in subsidies to procure 13 houses, we’re never going to get enough of them. ARTICLES 1. America Can’t Do Without Fracking Shale is crucial to the U.S. economy, and it allows Washington to buttress our allies across the globe. By Daniel Yergin, WSJ, Oct. 30, 2024 TWTW Summary: The Chairman of S&P Global and long-time writer on energy begins with: “This year’s presidential race features an oddity: a discussion about a ban on fracking. What’s striking is that such a conversation is happening at all. This talk takes participants through the Wayback Machine to the first two decades of this century, when hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling—together known as fracking—came to public attention. The U.S. was then the world’s largest importer of oil. Today it is energy-independent with, S&P Global estimates, more than 70% of its oil and more than 80% of its natural gas produced through fracking. The process has become essential to the nation’s energy supply and can’t be eliminated. Not long ago the prospect of U.S. energy independence seemed fanciful. For more than four decades every president aspired to it, but their goal seemed unattainable. Many observers considered the U.S. destined to grow more dependent on imports. In recent years, however, America has achieved energy independence on a net basis. U.S. output is closing in on 13.5 million barrels of crude oil a day, exceeding that of perennial big producers Saudi Arabia and Russia by several million barrels per day. Add what are called natural-gas liquids, and the U.S. produces around 20 million barrels per day. Textbooks used to hold that commercial production of shale was impossible. Innovation and investment over decades have proved otherwise. Yet despite this progress, many continue to underestimate how transformative shale oil has been for the U.S. economy and the American way of life. Consider a concrete example. My firm estimates that battery-powered and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles will account for about 2% of the U.S. on-road light-vehicle fleet in 2024. If fracking were banned, the U.S. would need to import extraordinary amounts of oil to fuel our gasoline- and diesel-powered cars. In 2008, before shale-oil production began in earnest, the net bill for importing petroleum was $388 billion—more than 40% of the total merchandise trade deficit. Today the same bill, by contrast, is virtually nothing. There would be other costs to a phase-out of fracking. If the U.S. were to start importing again, the price of oil would doubtless rise, as we would be forced to compete for supplies with countries such as China, which is estimated to import more than 70% of its petroleum. The U.S. also exports a large amount of liquefied natural gas, mostly produced from shale. Without it, LNG’s positive effect on the trade balance would disappear too.” The author points out how disastrous a ban of fracking would be for the US allies in Europe and concludes with: “The same dynamic applies for U.S. allies in the Pacific. Japan and South Korea have come to rely on U.S. energy exports, which have proved essential for diversifying their supply and strengthening their security. Losing that contribution would make them more vulnerable, reduce their confidence in the reliability of the U.S., and likely push them toward importing from Russia. A ban on fracking would be both misguided and destructive for the U.S. and its allies. Recurrent out-of-touch debates on the topic need to be tabled in light of a central fact: Shale has become crucial to the U.S. economy and global energy security. It’s here to stay.” ************** 2. Climate Change Can Take Big Toll on Asian Economies, Inaction Could Cost More, ADB Report Says It could reduce Asia-Pacific’s gross domestic product by 17% in 2070, ADB says. By Fabiana Negrin Ochoa and Amanda Lee, WSJ, Oct 31, 2024 Link to: Asia-Pacific Climate Report 2024: Catalyzing Finance and Policy Solutions By Staff, Asian Development Bank, October 2024 TWTW Summary: The article and report are largely trivial. The estimated GDP of China was $114 billion in 1972 (50 years ago); it was $17,889 billion in 2023. About 157 times that of 1972. Doubt a calculated reduction of future growth of 17% 50 years from now is very meaningful to the leaders of Asian countries. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_GDP_of_China What are subsidies? This is where the woke far left excel. Confusion will be their epitaph (h/t King Crimson). To get their way on anything they invoke confusion: What is a woman? What is a working person etc. In the UK Labour party some revel in it. Take the very black Dawn Butler MP. When Badenoch was announced the winner of the Tory leadership contest…. “Butler declared, “A victory for Badenoch is an obvious, unprecedented and once inconceivable victory for racism,” adding that ‘Badenochism’ should be viewed as “white supremacy in Blackface”. Butler is also an expert of biology…. “””Babies are born without sex””” – [D Butler] S***, she really does say babies are born without a sex https://www.mumsnet.com/talk/womens_rights/3825633-Dawn-Butler-and-biology Starmer refuses to act, I suppose Dawn would call him a racist xenophobe etc if he did. The Bertrand Russell quote reminds me of this: “The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.” – H.L. Mencken I am in my seventies, and it’s been hobgoblins all my life … the Cold War, Communists under our beds, the missile crisis, Palestinians, Jonestown, other Arabs, North Korea, school shootings, serial killers, and lately AIDS, Covid and Climate Change. Mencken says “most of them imaginary, I say all of them. Fear in the hands of government is the easiest way to control the masses. Bertrand Russell….[warning, full of expletives] (00:30) The Ostfront, sorry; Otto front. (Way more neck than a giraffe…) A special from the world’s leading man-made weather attributionist. “”Why did so many die in Spain? Because Europe still hasn’t accepted the realities of extreme weather – Friederike Otto … Scientists have long known that heating the climate with fossil fuel emissions will result in the intensification of floods, storms, heatwaves, drought and wildfires. However, it was not until 2004 that the first attribution study formally linked a weather event … I founded World Weather Attribution in 2014 to shift the conversation. Our attribution studies are carried out quickly, over days or weeks, in the immediate aftermath of weather disasters to inform people in real time about the role of the climate crisis. A quick analysis following the floods in Spain found that the climate emergency made the extreme rainfall about 12% more intense and twice as likely. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/04/spain-deaths-europe-realities-extreme-weather-flooding You have to laugh. Europe has seen it all over the last 1000 years. Hot and cold. The title of the article regarding the Northern Hemisphere 2024 Hurricane season outcome noted that this region is “clearly below normal” which is absolutely true. Even if the the Northern Hemisphere rate of ACE growth remained at the highest value yet attained during the August to October peak levels during November (which is not happening) the Northern Hemisphere Season total through November would be about 20% below the long term average. It is clear the Northern Hemisphere 2024 season total is going to be well below normal, The only question is how far below normal will it end. Considering how the alarmist media exaggerates every hurricane that occurs in the North Atlantic as being the worse ever it seems appropriate that the reality of the actual situation globally needs to be addressed in a context that shows how ridiculous absurd such claims really are.

As an investor, how do you know what portions of robotaxi value will be owned by Tesla and what will be owned by xAI? How do you know that Musk won’t make the AI driver an xAI asset and license it to Tesla? How can you be sure enough in future AI driver ownership to make Tesla worth investing in? Comment

Read more Indian government bond yields were largely unchanged in early trades on Monday, as investors exercised caution ahead of the U.S. presidential election due on Tuesday. Read more The Indian stock market faced a broad sell-off, with the Sensex and Nifty 50 dropping over 1.5%. Nifty and Sensex have resumed their downward trend after a week of consolidation, largely due to heavy selling by FIIs. The expectation of another stimulus package from China is driving fund outflows from India to China, while FIIs are also booking profits ahead of the significant upcoming U.S. elections. Additionally, DIIs appear to be on the sidelines amid these major global events. Both Nifty and Sensex are approaching their 200-DMAs, around 23500 and 77000, respectively, where a temporary bottom may form. Bank Nifty is showing relative resilience, supported by attractive valuations.

US Department of Commerce rescinds proposed administrative reviews of the AntiDumping (AD) and Countervailing Duty (CVD) orders on quartz surfaces applicable to Pokarna Engineered Stone Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pokarna. Pokarna stock declined 1.31% on the NSE to ₹1,082.30 Afcons Infrastructure’s discount listing was in line with our expectations driven by market sentiments and lower than expected subscription. The subdued demand for IPO offer was mainly on the back of higher OFS by parent which is facing a challenging phase marked by significant debt and family business restructuring. The fund raised will help the parent better manage obligations, debt crisis in the other group companies. This objective was a hurdle for short term investors to bid aggressively. Despite the listing below issue price, we remain optimistic on the business long term growth. Long term rationale to invest and hold is justified mainly on the back of a Healthy order book supporting its future growth, strong Track record of executing complex, challenging and unique EPC projects both within India and internationally and Stable financial performance over the years along with a capable efficient management team to take the company to newer heights. For allotted investors, we recommend holding it for the long term as we believe long term growth is intact with Govt focus on infrastructure growth. Short term traders and investors can hold/accumulate more on dips with a target near to Rs 480-500. SpiceJet has received a boost with Acuité Ratings & Research upgrading its long-term rating by four notches to B+ and its short-term rating to A4.

Afcons Infrastructure Limited’s IPO was listed at ₹426, marking around an 8% loss from its issue price of ₹463, which aligned with expectations given the current market sentiment. The IPO received a moderate subscription of 2.7 times, primarily driven by interest from institutional and retail investors. The listing performance reflects the cautious market outlook, despite the company’s strong credentials as part of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group and a solid order book supporting future growth. While the discounted listing may disappoint short-term investors, the IPO’s reasonable pricing, along with Afcons’ stable financial performance and project pipeline, offer potential long-term value. Investors with a long-term outlook may consider holding onto their shares, as the company’s fundamentals could drive gradual value appreciation once market conditions stabilize. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intelegain.rb Conference call Replay available in Various speeds !

The Reserve Bank of India data show that outstanding loans against shares and bonds as of end of August 2024 stood at ₹9,722 crore, growing almost 27 per cent year-on-year. This, at a time when the overall personal loans category has grown at 14 per cent YoY as of August 2024. Outstanding loans against shares stood at ₹5,713 crore towards the end of August 2015.

Title: The China threat and the EV slowdown— 2 takeaways from a busy few weeks in auto news

Time Published: 2024-11-03T17:21:01Z

It's been a busy few days for auto companies. Ford and Volkswagen each pulled back vehicle production plans this week. After the last shift on Friday, November 15, Ford will pause F-150 Lightning production until next year, while VW said it is considering historic plant closures in Germany that would lay off hundreds of workers. Meanwhile, Tesla fell behind China's BYD in quarterly revenue for the first time, and GM CEO Mary Barra warned of an unsustainable price war in the Chinese EV market. Amid the flurry of news, two themes stand out: the China threat and EV slowdown loom large for automakers. In China, the world's largest auto market, EV leaders BYD and Tesla are engaged in a bitter price war that initially weighed heavily on BYD's bottom line. But by August, BYD (which also sells hybrid cars) reported its best-ever passenger car sales, driving up revenue 24% in the third quarter to $28.24 billion, topping Tesla for the first time. It's the latest sign that after nearly two years of deflating the value of its cars, Tesla is finally starting to feel the pinch of a slowdown in the EV market. The Chinese EV market is more competitive than ever, according the GM's Barra, who questioned the sustainability of a broader price war in the region driven by an uptick in Chinese EV startups selling inexpensive vehicles. Inexpensive Chinese EVs have long threatened the US EV market. They aren't just well-priced; many are also good-looking and well-equipped. Ford CEO Mark Ford said last week that he's been driving the Chinese-made Xiaomi SU7 for six months and doesn't want to give it up. Some car companies already sell China-built EVs in the US, but Biden Administration bans on Chinese vehicles keep competitors like BYD from entering the market. Europe is also slapping tariffs on Chinese EVs as these cars upend their retail market. As Volkswagen loses ground to BYD in Europe, the automotive giant is considering massive production pull-backs, including closing three German factories for the first time in its history. In the US, Ford announced its own EV production pull-backs this week, stopping assembly of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck until next year in a bid to improve profitability for its money-losing EV segment. Both companies are coupling these production rationalizations with other cost-cutting measures. At Ford, managerial bonuses tied to quality and manufacturing costs will be slashed to 65% of last year's levels. VW has said it plans to lay off workers and may cut wages. Over-production isn't just a problem for EVs, though. Overall vehicle inventory levels remained elevated at the end of October, driving up manufacturer-funded discounts, according to JD Power. Dealers ended October with about 2 million units in stock, a 4% increase from September and a 25% increase from the previous year. Some companies are more affected by inventory bloat than others. Stellantis, which is navigating the toughest year in its short history, is specifically focused on reducing inventory levels in the US, and reported some progress on that effort in the third quarter.

Title: 2024 election: Top portfolio plays for a Trump or Harris victory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Buckle up. That’s the message from Wall Street pros as investors brace for a close 2024 presidential election. So far this year, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has rallied 21%, making 2024 the best election year through October since 1936. But that outperformance could be at risk, at least in the immediate term, as the too-close-to-call race is largely expected to trigger market volatility. Predictions market Polymarket currently shows a 62.3% chance that Donald Trump will win the election, and that has prompted a return of the so-called Trump trade. Treasurys dropped and gold soared once again last week as investors bet that Trump’s proposed policies surrounding tariffs and tax cuts could prove to be inflationary. “The key for markets will be certainty in the outcome from which to understand economic impacts and evaluate implications for the trend of economic growth and evaluation of sector winners and losers,” Rob Haworth, US Bank Wealth Management senior investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance. Given the key themes that have emerged from Trump's and Harris’s respective campaigns, I asked a number of strategists what a Republican versus Democratic presidency means for business and Wall Street and narrowed that list down to three trade ideas under each scenario. Read more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election Financials is viewed as a top trade under a Republican presidency on the expectations for looser regulation and increased M&A activity. According to a recent note from Fitch Ratings, a July 2021 executive order under the Biden-Harris administration encouraging greater scrutiny of mergers has impeded deal activity — guidance that is expected to change under Trump. “While no proposed mergers have been formally denied since the directive took effect, approval times have increased markedly and, in some cases, to the point of making deals non-viable, as market conditions turned during the review period,” Christopher Wolfe, head of North American banks for Fitch Ratings, wrote in a note. UBS Global Wealth Management ElectionWatch co-lead Kurt Reiman told me financials stand out as a “key beneficiary” in both a red sweep scenario (meaning Republicans control the White House, Senate, and House) and a Trump presidency with a split Congress. Reiman said a looser regulatory environment could lead to lower costs and greater ability to return capital to shareholders, as well as a higher likelihood that consolidation in the financial services industry would face less resistance. On the flip side, Reiman and his team see Democrats controlling the White House, Senate, and House as a “worst-case scenario” for financial services due in part to the probability of greater support for the Credit Card Competition Act — a bill he views as ushering in new regulations and stricter interpretations of current rules. Bank of America’s Jason Kupferberg echoed a similar sentiment. In a recent note to clients, Kupferberg and his team wrote that a Democratic sweep would be a “worst case scenario” for the payments sector for two reasons: higher probability of a tougher stance on the DOJ’s lawsuit versus Visa (V) and the potential for new laws to lessen Visa's and Mastercard's (MA) competitive edge in the US. The expectation of higher spending under a second Trump administration has sent gold (GC=F) prices to record highs. The precious metal closed the week at $2,734.44 an ounce, bringing its year-to-date gains to 34%. And the run may be far from over, according to Wealth Alliance president Eric Diton. “We just don't have a plan as a country to deal with our $35 trillion in debt and growing. … I haven't heard any talk about any kind of reduction in spending from either candidate,” Diton told Yahoo Finance. While neither candidate seems to have a plan to address the country's ballooning deficit, a recent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated Trump’s policies could add $7.5 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years, compared to $3.5 trillion under Harris. Managed-care insurers could see some relief under a second Trump administration due to the likelihood of greater support for privatized programs like Medicare Advantage — an approach long preferred by Republicans. And that could give a boost to companies like Humana (HUM), UnitedHealth (UNH), and CVS (CVS). Oppenheimer’s Michael Wiederhorn named Humana as the firm’s "best idea" for a Republican sweep, noting that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries account for 87% of the company’s premium revenue. “The key ways that a Republican regime could support Mastercard include strong rate increases and a favorable regulatory environment,” Wiederhorn noted. It’s a pivotal election for the electric vehicle industry, and not just because of Trump’s close ties with Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Rather, the former president’s promise to roll back the Biden administration’s EV policies on "day one" could have significant implications. “This week’s election, and the potential shift in government regulations based on who wins, will be more consequential to the automotive industry than any previous election,” iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer said in a statement. Earlier this year, RBC’s Tom Narayan told me Trump’s “erratic” behavior during his first term left the auto industry uneasy, and they view his past threats as a potential challenge to their business if he were to be elected. On the other hand, Harris has been supportive of the current administration’s efforts to expand access to EVs. She is largely expected to extend the Biden-era $7,500 tax incentive for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs — a credit that Guggenheim’s Ron Jewsikow has told me is a “key affordability enabler.” Wedbush’s Dan Ives sees a Harris ticket as a positive for General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Stellantis (STLA), and the EV industry more broadly, including Tesla. Harris’s promise to support the housing market and make home affordability a centerpiece of her economic agenda is a bullish sign for homebuilders, according to Oppenheimer. The team, led by analyst Tyler Batory, sees Harris’s plan to build 3 million new housing units and improve housing affordability as a key catalyst for the sector. The team named D.R. Horton (DHI) as a top housing play, making the case that the stock is “uniquely positioned” given its focus on entry-level housing. “The company’s lower ASP (pricing) should benefit from increased demand from a tax credit, and its scale would allow further ramping of home production,” Batory wrote. In the company’s third quarter earnings call, D.R. Horton CEO Paul Romanowski warned affordability and election uncertainty had prompted “some buyers to stay on the sidelines in the near-term," sending ripples across the industry. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF declined 1.6% for the week, bringing its one-month loss to -8%. More social support under a Harris administration will boost off-price retailers, according to Evercore’s Michael Binetti. “A blue sweep would likely benefit the lowest income consumers and within our space, Burlington Stores has the lowest income demographics and a bigger margin opportunity than Ross Stores,” Binetti wrote. Off-price retailers have outperformed this year as consumers hunt for value amid sticky inflation. Burlington Stores (BURL) posted better-than-expected earnings and raised its outlook during its most recent quarterly report, while Ross Stores’ (ROST) value offerings helped boost sales by 7%. Shares of Burlington have soared 100% over the past year, while Ross has jumped 21%. Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Smith on Twitter @SeanaNSmith.

About a year ago, a dividend investor shared his detailed income report and story on r/Dividends – a discussion board for income investors with over 600,000 members. The investor said his investing account was started with $60,000, which he saved in his 403(b) retirement plan while working at his first job for eight years. He then rolled over this money into an IRA. The investor said this $60,000 rose to $1.2 million in 27 years from 1996 "without putting any new money." "During that time, I have experienced tremendous market ups/downs like the internet (tech) bubble/burst, housing bubble/burst, Great Recession and recent Covid-19 crash and recovery. During all these times, my focus was the growth of company stocks, mutual funds and ETFs. My core holdings were always SPY and QQQ about 50-70% and occasionally some speculative stocks about 20-30%," the investor said. Trending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends He highlighted that he stayed invested in the market during all these ups and downs. The investor said he is now retired and switched his focus to dividend investing in 2022. "My only regret is that I should have switched to dividend focus a little sooner when I had $1.5m, but I guess it's life. Its projected dividend yield is ~9%, but I will be content with ~8% dividend yield." The investor clarified that most of his portfolio gains came from when he focused on growth. "The only dividend I have received during my accumulation phase was from SPY & QQQ. I heavily focused on growth," he said. The investor’s portfolio screenshots showed his monthly dividend income of about $9,495 or $113,949 per year. Most of his holdings were dividend ETFs. Let's take a look at the portfolio. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:JEPI) was the biggest position in the portfolio of the investor earning $9,495 per month in dividend income. The portfolio screenshots showed he owned 5,323 shares of JEPI, worth about $288,187 at the time. The investor raked in about $32,933 in annual dividend income from the ETF. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) was the second-biggest position of the Redditor, earning $9,495 per month in dividends, as his position in the covered call ETF was valued at about $268,275. JEPQ distributes monthly dividends, invests in Nasdaq companies and generates extra income by selling call options. The ETF yields about 9.2%. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) is one of the best ways to enjoy dividend income and capital gains through stock price appreciation as the ETF exposes some of the top tech stocks in the NASDAQ-100 index. The fund pays quarterly dividends and yields about 0.6%. The investor owned 544 shares of the fund, according to the screenshots he publicly shared on Reddit. During the discussion on his post, the investor commented about his conviction in the QQQ: "Since I am much younger than Buffett, I also have faith in QQQ. I have faith in American entrepreneurship and technological creativity. So, my core holdings are always SPY and QQQ." The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust One of the key perks of investing in The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is that it allows you to see your capital grow and get quarterly dividend payments. The fund has a dividend yield of about 1.2%. The Redditor earning $9,495 per month in dividends had 433 SPY shares in his portfolio, valued at about $181,868. The investment brought in $2,792 in annual dividend income for the investor. Ares Capital Ares Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:ARCC) is a business development company with a dividend yield of about 9%. The investor had 5,820 shares of Ares Capital in his portfolio, worth about $109,532 at the time. The investment earned about $11,174 in income. Global X Russell 2000 Covered Call ETF The investor earning $9,495 monthly dividends had an $82,000 position in Global X Russell 2000 Covered Call ETF (NYSE:RYLD). The fund generates income by selling call options on the small-cap-heavy Russell 2000 Index. The ETF yields about 12%. Being a covered call ETF, RYLD can incur losses during down markets. Trending: Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF The iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE:HYG) provides investors with exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated high-yield corporate bonds. It tracks the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid High Yield Index, which comprises a broad range of below-investment-grade bonds. The fund has a dividend yield of about 6%. YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE:TSLY) is a popular YieldMax dividend ETF for high-yield seekers. With a distribution rate of over 60%, TSLY generates income by selling call options on Tesla shares. Over the past year, TSLY has been down about 42%, while Tesla is up 28%. Guggenheim Strategic Opportunities Fund Guggenheim Strategic Opportunities Fund (NYSE:GOF) exposes investors to fixed-income and other debt securities. It invests in various credit instruments, including corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities and other high-yield debt. However, it's a risky investment because it invests in ungraded bonds, also known as junk bonds. The investor, who earned $9,495 per month, had 776 shares of GOF in his portfolio. This investment generated $1,695 in annual income. iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond BuyWrite Strat ETF iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond BuyWrite Strat ETF (BATS:TLTW) invests in U.S. Treasury bonds with 20 years or more maturities. It also generates income by selling call options on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 20+ Year U.S. Treasury Index. The current interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through publicly-traded REITs. Arrived Homes, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform, has launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly.

Title: Intel reportedly scaling back R&D teams in Israel — several hundred talented staff will go

But already this year dozens have left for Nvidia. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Intel plans to reduce its workforce by several hundred employees at its Israeli research and development centers, following similar job cuts at its facilities elsewhere, reports DigiTimes. This move is part of the company's general cost-cutting measures amid financial challenges, and it opens opportunities for competitors to attract Intel's talent. There is a catch, though, as dozens of Intel employees already left the company for Nvidia earlier this year, according to Globes. Intel's Israeli operations employ around 11,700 people, including 7,800 in R&D roles and 3,900 in manufacturing, with the latest layoffs expected to focus on R&D while leaving manufacturing staff largely intact as Intel readies for the completion of Fab 38 in Kiryat Gat, the report says. The exact number of people that will either be proposed to leave voluntarily, or retire, or just laid off is not known, but Globes reports that Intel is set to cut its Israeli workforce by several hundred positions. Intel has three R&D sites in Israel. Each of these Israeli centers has a specialized focus: Haifa works on CPUs, AI hardware, and software; Petah Tikva develops communications and AI solutions; and Jerusalem is involved in communications, software, and cybersecurity. The report does not specify which R&D sites will see more cuts, other than saying that layoffs are expected in these R&D centers. But let us try to detail at least one thing. Intel's Israeli R&D team is responsible for multiple breakthrough microarchitectures, such as Banias, Yonah/Merom, and Nehalem, just to name a few. Each of these was strategically important for Intel at some point. In fact, the Banias processor was the heart of Intel's Centrino platform, the company's first platform developed specifically for laptops, which pretty much revolutionized the market. Yonah/Merom put Intel back on the map of high-performance PCs and replaced the power-hungry Netburst microarchitecture that powered Pentium 4 processors. But while Intel itself is slashing its R&D talent in Israel, it should be noted that people are leaving the company, too. Nvidia has been hiring former Intel employees: in 2024 alone, at least 30 Intel employees moved to Nvidia's offices in Yokneam and Tel Aviv, with total hires from Intel estimated to range from 60 to 90, according to the Globes report which analyzed LinkedIn profiles. Nvidia is expected to hire more Intel employees as the layoffs continue, possibly bringing the number to about 100. As of June 30, Nvidia reported a workforce of 4,000 employees in Israel, reflecting the company’s growing presence in the region. Many Intel employees who moved to Nvidia are benefiting from more attractive compensation packages. For instance, a junior hardware engineer at Nvidia can expect a starting annual salary of NIS 566,000 (around $151,500), about 33% higher than the equivalent role at Intel. Nvidia also offers significantly more valuable share options compared to Intel, with packages starting at NIS 56,200 annually ($15,045). In addition to Nvidia, other major tech companies are also drawing former Intel employees. Apple, Amazon, and Intel's subsidiary Mobileye have recently hired from Intel's workforce in Israel. Some groups have joined Microsoft, Google, and Huawei, which operates a development center in Haifa. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Title: Markets brace for presidential election, Fed meeting: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Election Day is almost here. The looming question remains how a Donald Trump or Kamala Harris victory will shape the market narrative for the rest of the year and beyond. Investors should soon learn the answer, with Americans heading to the polls on Tuesday. In the week before the election, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 1.37% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5% despite hitting its first record close since June during the week. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just over 0.1%. It's not the only big event of the week. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest policy decision, with markets largely anticipating that the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Earnings season rolls on with a week headlined by reports from Palantir (PLTR), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Arm (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Moderna (MRNA). One of the top potentially market-moving events that strategists have discussed throughout the year has finally arrived with the 2024 presidential election slated for Tuesday, Nov. 5. But it's been an abnormal election year for markets. When analyzing the S&P 500's average intraday trading range, Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick found that this past October was the second-least volatile month leading into an election in the past 50 years. Zooming out further, research from Bespoke Investment Group shows the S&P 500 had its best start to an election year since 1932, with a 20% year-to-date return for the benchmark index through the end of October. Still, Election Day itself is considered a risk event for markets. Speculation has built that a "Trump Trade" has been forming in markets as the betting odds of the former president winning the election have risen. But some market strategists aren't convinced there's a clear read on what outcome investors will be rooting for come Tuesday. "I think the market would do fine with Harris," Yardeni Research chief markets strategist Eric Wallerstein told Yahoo Finance. "I think the market would do fine with Trump. I don't think the stock market is really pricing any presidential odds." Franklin Templeton chief markets strategist Stephen Dover told Yahoo Finance that the key for markets could simply be getting past the event itself. "Just having those elections settled, whichever way it goes, would be positive," Dover said. Baird market strategist Michael Antonelli agreed, telling Yahoo Finance that the riskiest scenario from the election is "one where we just don't know the winner." Markets are widely expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points when it announces its next policy decision on Nov. 7. The key question entering the meeting is what the Federal Reserve will (or won't) signal about its plans for future meetings. Given that data has continued to show an economy pacing for solid growth while inflation's path down to the Fed's 2% goal remains bumpy, markets have moved to price in fewer interest rate cuts over the next year than initially thought when the Fed cut rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18. As of Friday, markets see about three less rate cuts through the end of next year than previously thought. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Morgan Stanley chief global economist Seth Carpenter doesn't think markets will get much more clarity on the Fed's path in the coming week. "The strength in growth gives the Fed patience as it allows policy easing to be gradual," Carpenter wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Neither inflation nor unemployment is forcing the Fed's hand. We do not expect Powell to give specific guidance on the size or cadence of future cuts. Policy remains data-dependent, and neither the September 50 [basis point] cut nor the November 25 [basis point] cut indicates the future pace." The market's debate over how much easing the Fed will enact over the next year has sent the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) soaring since the last Fed meeting in September. The 10-year added about 7 basis points on Friday to close near 4.36%, its highest level since early July. Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield told Yahoo Finance that the move in rates, and the overall focus on the economic data driving them higher, is overshadowing what's shaping up to be another solid quarter of corporate results. With 70% of the S&P 500 having reported quarterly results, the benchmark index is pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 5.1%. This would mark the fifth straight quarter of earnings growth as the index continues to rebound from the earnings recession seen in 2023. "We went through a two-year period where earnings were flat," Mayfield said. "They were volatile. Now we have earnings on the rise again. They're beating analyst expectations at a pretty solid clip. Profit margins are expanding. So the big picture is things look pretty good." And that story appears to be staying intact for the fourth quarter too. Since the period began at the start of October, analysts have cut estimates by 1.8%, according to FactSet data. This is in line with the average cut to earnings seen over the past 10 years. "At a certain point, earnings have to take the baton," Mayfield said. "I think we're in a good position for earnings to do that."

Title: DAILY BEAST Tries to Claw Way Back to Relevance...
URL: https://dnyuz.com/2024/11/03/the-daily-beast-tries-to-claw-its-way-back-to-relevance/
Time Published: 2024-11-03T12:31:37Z
Full Content:
On a sunny morning in early October, Joanna Coles, clad in a stylish tomato-red coat, and Ben Sherwood, dressed more demurely in a corduroy jacket, convened at their regular breakfast spot, the no-frills Star on 18 diner on Manhattan’s Far West Side. The two veteran media executives were talking about their ambitious plans for The Daily Beast, the 16-year-old money-losing news website, in which they jointly acquired a minority stake in April. But along with the predictable optimism about the mission they are taking on and enthusiasm about early signs of audience uptick and subscriber growth, Ms. Coles, a former chief content officer of Hearst Magazines, and Mr. Sherwood, a onetime president of ABC News and Disney TV chief, also conveyed a sense of frustration. Frustration that they weren’t greeted by the staff they inherited as warmly as they expected. Frustration that the site’s tech problems meant they’ve had to buy multiple subscriptions just to log in. Frustration that convincing the newsroom of their editorial vision has been an uphill climb. Less than three weeks after the pair’s takeover, New York magazine published a detailed report on the friction between reporters and Ms. Coles over story suggestions that they deemed ridiculous, including an investigation into whether former President Donald J. Trump was having stress-induced flatulence during his criminal trial and a list of the most obese members of Congress. (Neither article ran.) It was clear that many of the sources for the report were inside the organization, with one unnamed staff member bluntly criticizing the new owners’ “warped vision” of the news site. “This thing came within a day of being sold to the private equity knacker’s yard, where it would have been stripped,” Ms. Coles said later in an interview at The Beast’s offices in Chelsea, using a British term for a junkyard. “In what way is it helpful to tape our conversations and to proudly boast that you are not going to even attempt to look at the stories that your new bosses are asking you to look at?” “To me, that’s just, like, ‘No wonder the place is going out of business,’” she added. For his part, Mr. Sherwood was aghast that Beast journalists had anonymously complained about a Daily Beast article on plans by Barron Trump, Mr. Trump’s youngest son, to attend New York University. The article relied on a source of Ms. Coles and was published without a byline. “That happens to be something that she knew stone cold — her source was solid,” Mr. Sherwood said. “The organization went into a convulsion over this because Joanna did not reveal her source and no one could stand this up with any of their sources.” But, he asked, “where is Barron Trump at school now?” Indeed, the 18-year-old was spotted on the New York University campus for the start of the school year in September. Mr. Sherwood wrote a Beast article confirming the April scoop. The Daily Beast, launched in 2008 by the longtime magazine editor Tina Brown and backed by Barry Diller’s IAC, became known over the years as a cheeky and aggressive tabloid with reporting on politics and national security that often had an impact belying the relatively small size of its newsroom. In recent years, it published a series of damaging scoops on the Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker and broke the news of the arrest of the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Named for the fictional newspaper in Evelyn Waugh’s “Scoop,” The Daily Beast gave a platform to a new generation of writers, like Taylor Lorenz, Jamelle Bouie and Molly Jong-Fast. When Ms. Brown started the site — after stints editing Vanity Fair, The New Yorker and, less successfully, Talk magazine — she preached a mix of “high-low” stories. “The Daily Beast at its best was mischievous, subversive and absolutely 100 percent dedicated, often to the point of sociopathy, to breaking big news,” said Noah Shachtman, its editor in chief from 2018 to 2021. “If you look back at this moment in previous election cycles, The Beast played an incredible role.” But the outlet continuously lost money, and audience traffic has declined over the last two years. Fed up with the losses, Mr. Diller tried to offload The Daily Beast, at one point considering a deal with the Hollywood publication The Ankler and then looking to sell to a private-equity-backed publisher before landing on the partnership with Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles. “It was imminent: We were selling The Beast,” Mr. Diller said in an interview. But after meeting with Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles, he felt their plan made sense. “I want to give it a last chance,” Mr. Diller said. “It’s very early in the process, but I am more than pleased that we made that decision.” Mr. Sherwood, 60, and Ms. Coles, 62, were jointly granted a 49 percent equity stake in the business, returning them to the day-to-day scrum of a media company. (None of the parties would disclose the financial details of the deal; IAC still retains majority control.) The two seem, on the face of it, an odd pairing. She’s a glamorous Briton who conquered the world of glossy magazines and is best known for her star turn as editor in chief of Cosmopolitan from 2012 to 2016. He’s a Harvard-educated Rhodes scholar who made “Good Morning America” the top morning news show while president of ABC News from 2010 to 2014, before being promoted to oversee Disney’s TV group. They struck up a friendship in 2013 after Mr. Sherwood was impressed by a speech Ms. Coles gave at a New York awards event. By his telling, he went back to his office and immediately wrote her a letter saying he was inspired by her story of coming from Yorkshire, England, to “the pinnacle of publishing in America.” The pair met for lunch and discovered a mutually voracious love for the news. “We would try to text each other stories that we thought the other wouldn’t have come across,” Ms. Coles said. “And he really doesn’t miss anything. His breadth of reading is astonishing to me.” He has “a sense of the absurd and the funny, which a lot of people don’t,” she added. The two talked about doing a journalism project together when Ms. Coles left Hearst in 2018, after she was passed over for the presidency of the magazine division, and Mr. Sherwood left Disney in 2019. But nothing quite came together. In the years that followed, Mr. Sherwood founded and sold Mojo, a youth sports start-up, and Ms. Coles executive-produced the Freeform show “The Bold Type” while heading up a so-called blank-check company and sitting on the boards of Snap and Sonos. The thought of returning to a newsroom thrilled both Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles, especially one that had the benefit of years of brand building under editors like Ms. Brown, John Avlon (now running for Congress), Mr. Shachtman (who went on to lead Rolling Stone) and Tracy Connor, who had come to The Daily Beast from the NBC News investigative unit. But Ms. Coles and Mr. Sherwood had to immediately confront the fact that the media landscape had changed significantly in their time away from it. In the past few years, BuzzFeed News has shut down, Vice Media filed for bankruptcy and other publishers did mass layoffs. And new competitors kept coming: Puck, Punchbowl, The Free Press, Semafor, the various writers building their singular empires on Substack (including, just recently, Ms. Brown herself). The Beast was on track to lose $10 million this year, Mr. Sherwood said, and had been losing money and audience for five consecutive quarters before the deal in April. “The plans that had been set in place were on a path to lose tens and tens of millions of dollars, and that path was no longer viable and IAC was no longer going to do that,” Mr. Sherwood said. That was the message he and Ms. Coles delivered when they met with the staff of The Daily Beast for the first time on April 15. They thought the newsroom would be relieved that it was now in the hands of experienced media executives with serious bona fides who were committed to revitalizing it. The Beast staff saw it differently. According to interviews with nearly a dozen former and current members, some of whom shared notes taken at the first meetings with their new bosses, and all of whom asked to remain anonymous out of fear of jeopardizing their career prospects, Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles came across as aggressive and relentlessly negative about the state of The Beast and the work that its staff was doing. Ms. Coles, who serves as the chief creative and content officer and runs the editorial side of the operation, told the staff that she and Mr. Sherwood wanted more “funny” and would “flood the zone” with content, the staff members said. Mr. Sherwood, who is the publisher and chief executive, became visibly angry when discussing his personal grievance: the technology issues that bedeviled the site’s paywall and payment system. In the weeks that followed, Ms. Coles began issuing story ideas that many in the newsroom chafed at and suggested hiring a “Lauren Sánchez correspondent” to report on the fiancée of the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Reporters started leaving, including the Washington bureau chief, Matt Fuller, and some of his political reporters. (Mr. Fuller’s replacement, Martin Pengelly, a journalist from The Guardian, lasted five weeks in the job.) In early June, The Beast’s editor in chief since 2021, Ms. Connor, was replaced with Hugh Dougherty, an editor from The New York Post and, like Ms. Coles, a veteran of the British press. Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles announced a voluntary buyout program with an aim of cutting costs by $1.5 million. By the beginning of July, The Beast’s head count was down about 35 percent through the buyouts and a handful of layoffs. Ms. Coles has a specific vision for what The Beast can do: shorter and sharper articles that focus on people, power, politics and pop culture, with a dose of satire to lighten the mood during a perilous time. She says she is fascinated by the extremes of wealth and power and behavior, and pointed to articles about A-list celebrities who gave Sean Combs cover and the troubles of Will Lewis, the chief executive of The Washington Post, as recent highlights. “I wanted something that curated a lot of news out there that wasn’t about the end of democracy all the time,” she said. Ms. Coles said she felt that The Beast had “some very good editors” over the years, but that its place in the media landscape had been diminished. “I certainly wasn’t reading it on a regular basis,” she said. “Another editor said to me when we came here, he said: ‘It’s the boring avatar of the resistance.’ I thought he summed it up in one.” She is trying to spark ideas and reinvigorate the newsroom’s culture, which she said had been affected when the pandemic caused more people to work remotely. Beast employees are now required to work in the office four days a week. “We have some really good people here who were here all along who are excited by the mission and re-energized,” Ms. Coles said. There are others she was not as fond of. Ms. Coles recounted that a political reporter did not call in to the newsroom on the Sunday that President Biden announced he would drop out of the presidential race. Ms. Coles was at her house in the Hamptons that day, hosting her friend Emma Tucker, the editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal and a fellow Briton, and the pair “turned my dining room table into an ad hoc newsroom.” “I was incredulous that a political reporter would not call in because it was the weekend,” she said. “To me it was madness that we would have political correspondents who didn’t want to cover that story immediately.” That political reporter, Jake Lahut, who has since left, referred The New York Times to the three articles he filed the day that Mr. Biden dropped out. “The most important lesson I’ve learned from this is how not to run a newsroom,” Mr. Lahut said. There has been “a Niagara of news,” as Ms. Coles described it, in the lead-up to November’s election, but The Beast’s newsroom is now less than half the size it was six months ago. And days away from the presidential election, the Washington bureau is staffed with just two people. “They saved us, to what end?” one reporter who has left The Beast asked. “What is The Daily Beast now, and is it better?” The lack of staffing during an intense news period has turned the newsroom into a churn factory, according to people with knowledge of the work environment, with pressure on employees to pump out articles to generate as much reader traffic as possible. The newsroom has been asked to publish at least 40 posts a day, which is what it was producing before the staffing cuts. According to a presentation given to the newsroom in September, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, The Daily Beast published more than 210 articles in three days around the presidential debate in September. Many of the articles on the website are now aggregated from content published elsewhere or written by freelance contributors, though there is still some original reporting. Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles have also contributed to the site, with Mr. Sherwood appearing to relish a return to his reporting days of decades ago: He has already written more than 50 articles, including updates on the Menendez brothers’ case (which Mr. Sherwood notes he has followed since 1989) and a post on the 100th birthday of the Caesar salad. The Coles-and-Sherwood Daily Beast has had its outside detractors. Ms. Jong-Fast, the MSNBC pundit and former Beast editor-at-large, said in an interview: “At a time when we need brave voices and serious journalism more than ever, it’s devastating to watch it devolve into tacky clickbait.” The NBC News reporter Brandy Zadrozny, another former Beast writer, posted a similar view on Instagram Threads in September: “It’s weird watching someone buy something you love, take that thing that was once good, and just slowly murder it in public. Anyway RIP The Daily Beast.” Despite criticism of The Beast’s editorial approach, Mr. Sherwood credited the heightened news cycle over the last few months with helping the site record four months of subscriber growth. Data from the measurement firm Comscore showed a recent bump in visitors to The Beast’s site, with 21.3 million in September, up from a monthly average of 13.8 million in 2023. “They have had a profitable month or two, which historically has not happened at The Beast,” Mr. Diller said. “That is quite significant.” Mr. Sherwood said they were stabilizing the business by getting the staff to the right size, fixing the technology powering the website and migrating to a new content management system. (The company recently added a president and chief operating officer, the tech entrepreneur Keith Bonnici.) Mr. Sherwood said they would focus on growth in their second year, such as exploring new revenue streams. “We are totally aware of how hard and adverse the conditions are,” Mr. Sherwood said, but “we’re more optimistic in the path than ever with independent, feisty, intelligent tabloid journalism.” Ms. Coles has focused on building buzz for the new Daily Beast. She regularly appears on cable television shows, and recently suggested without evidence on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Mr. Trump was “microdosing drugs,” a claim the host Jonathan Lemire had to quickly clear up. She has tapped her extensive Rolodex to sign up Samantha Bee, the television host and comedian, to co-host a podcast with her. Guests so far have included the “Last Week Tonight” host John Oliver and the Democratic strategist James Carville. The Beast also was quick to jump on the non-endorsement scandals engulfing The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, posting a link to subscribe on X with the message: “The Daily Beast reports without fear or favor. Apparently, that’s something not all newsrooms can do.” Ms. Brown, the founder, said she had advised Ms. Coles on “reviving the talent” and getting a mix of seasoned reporters and young writers. “The Daily Beast is really an upscale tabloid with attitude,” Ms. Brown said. “I think it definitely needed a face-lift.” The post The Daily Beast Tries to Claw Its Way Back to Relevance appeared first on New York Times.

Title: Markets Brace For Earnings, Election, And The Fed

Time Published: 2024-11-03T12:08:16Z
Full Content:
This week features more earnings, the Presential election and a Federal Reserve meeting. Within the S&P 500, 170 companies reported earnings last week, and 75% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season begins slow, but 102 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), featured heavily in last week’s earnings. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple reported better-than-expected earnings. Tesla reported much better-than-expected earnings the previous week, and NVIDIA won’t report until late November. Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the better earnings made a significant positive change to the pace of earnings growth for the quarter. Magnificent 7: Q3 Earnings Growth Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported robust earnings growth on Saturday. The big story was Warren Buffett’s continued sales of Apple (AAPL); a deeper dive is available here. The S&P 500 fell by 1.4% for the week. The Magnificent 7 lost 1.8% due to declines in Tesla, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple. Market Returns Among the companies reporting this week are Emerson Electric (EMR), Yum! Brands (YUM), Becton Dickinson (BDX), and Airbnb (ABNB). The communications services, healthcare, consumer discretionary, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to the FactSet data, the earnings growth rate for the technology sector retreated to 6.4%, down from 15.5%, primarily due to a one-time charge at Apple. Apple had a $10.2 billion one-time tax charge related to a reversal of the European General Court’s aid decision. Looking at apples-to-apples profits excluding this charge, Apple’s earnings grew 12.3% year-over-year. 3Q 2024 Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth has exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from 4.9% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. 3Q 2024 Sales By Sector So far, the blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +5.1% year-over-year, above the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter, but an improvement over the previous week’s 3.6%. Earnings Summary While the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, the evidence unmistakably shows that investors should not make investment decisions based solely on their political beliefs. A detailed analysis of the history of elections and stock returns is here. The election could add to market volatility, but stocks have been higher two-thirds of the time post-election until the end of the year, with a median rise of 3.7%. Stock Returns Around Presidential Elections While the October monthly jobs report was weak, with only 12,000 jobs created and a downward revision of the last two months, the storms and strikes negatively impacted the results. Despite the noisy data, the markets are pricing in high confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) at the meeting on Thursday. Another 25 basis points cut is expected in December, so Chair Powell’s remarks will be crucial to fine-tuning those expectations. Expected Federal Reserve Rate Cuts Robust earnings growth from most of the Magnificent 7 companies helped lift the overall outcome of the earnings season. This week remains busy on the earnings front with additional possible volatility from the Presential election and the Federal Reserve meeting. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently holds Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Emerson Electric (EMR), Yum! Brands (YUM), Becton Dickinson (BDX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. We're into the final hours before election day. Tens of millions of Americans have already voted. Business Insider will be covering this final stretch and the days that follow with a sharp focus on what the next president will mean for you. From the prices you pay to how to invest, we'll have you covered. And if you're looking for a break from politics, we'll also continue to bring you all of the most important stories in business. You can find it all on our homepage or on our app. On the agenda today: But first: Takeaways from a big week in Big Tech. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. The trillion-dollar giants of Big Tech reported earnings this week, beating estimates and committing billions to AI. The big winners: Those able to signal a strong return on that investment. Alphabet Google's cloud business benefited from AI adoption, posting a 35% year-over-year increase in revenues, while CEO Sundar Pichai said more than a quarter of the company's new code is now created by AI. The core advertising business held strong despite growing competition from the likes of OpenAI, Reddit, and more. Amazon The retail and cloud giant smashed expectations, sending the stock soaring on Friday. It also benefited from AI adoption, as cloud unit AWS posted a 19% increase in revenues. A strong performance in retail, where execs said shoppers were buying cheaper items at higher volumes, and a sharp focus on cost control had investors cheering. Apple Apple beat revenue and profit estimates overall, but a year-over-year decline in revenue in China left investors underwhelmed. All eyes are now on demand for the iPhone 16 and whether new Apple Intelligence features help juice sales. Meta Meta beat estimates, though user growth came in below expectations. Mark Zuckerberg promised to keep spending on AI and flexed Meta's huge cluster of Nvidia H100 chips. Microsoft Microsoft also beat estimates, but concerns around capacity constraints in AI and the return on its investments in the space led the tech giant's stock lower across the week. In preparation for its future of autonomous vehicles, Tesla has been leaning on a specialized group of test drivers, part of what's known internally as "Project Rodeo." BI spoke with nine test drivers, who described sometimes perilous scenarios and near-crashes while testing unreleased software. Here's what they said. Scaling the corporate ladder was once a cornerstone of the American dream. Now, 42% of Americans say they don't even want a promotion, according to a survey by global HR consultancy Randstad. That's higher than the countries known for being more chill about work, like Italy, Spain, and New Zealand. The anti-advancement shift has left bosses scratching their heads. If promotions won't motivate workers, what will? Packing up the corporate ladder. After years of upping the ante with everything from exercise classes to laundry services, tech companies are clamping down on freebies. It's part of a wider push to cut costs across the industry. The lavish perks culture, once aimed at subsidizing nearly everything, led to entitlement and rule-bending among some employees. In a new era of efficiency and layoffs, tech workers need to get used to a new, non-extravagant normal. Use it, don't abuse it. As tension builds in the Indo-Pacific region, the United States Army is training warfighters for combat if a conflict with China breaks out. BI's Graham Flanagan spent two weeks in Hawaii to document the Army's sprawling, $16 million war-games exercise across the island chain. Watch the documentary here. This week's quote: "We were appalled to hear the non-data-driven explanation you gave for Amazon imposing a 5-day in-office mandate." — Amazon employees in a signed letter to AWS CEO Matt Garman, protesting his return-to-office comments. More of this week's top reads: LinkedIn thinks using AI could fix our hiring crisis — and help your career. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: I, Coppola

Advertisement More from the Review Subscribe to our Newsletter Best of The New York Review, plus books, events, and other items of interest November 21, 2024 Current Issue Current Issue More from the Review November 3, 2024 Lionsgate Adam Driver as Cesar Catilina and Nathalie Emmanuel as Julia Cicero in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 “Beware of the cliché, the predictable”: that’s one of the notes about storytelling that Francis Ford Coppola keeps posted where he works, as he reports in his book Live Cinema and Its Techniques.1 Watching Megalopolis—Coppola’s first film in thirteen years, funded with over $100 million of his own money—I realized that it should be two rules, not one. Cliché and predictable are not, in fact, synonyms. Megalopolis is one of the least predictable films ever made, a disorienting jumble of sci-fi, romance, political drama, historical epic, body horror, musical, satire, surrealism, magical realism, filmed theater, illustrated lecture, and inspirational after-school special. Scenes veer from stagy speeches to slapstick violence, hallucinatory dance numbers to raunchy sex to flashy special effects. Baffling details flicker by—a tree stump in the shape of a swastika, a sudden murder with a tiny bow and arrow, repeated incest jokes—not only without explanation but often without acknowledgment. A character might set off on a crucial mission only to disappear, and then be summarily killed in a flashback. A ludicrous plot twist might be interrupted by a moment of startling beauty. The protagonist, Cesar, played by Adam Driver, can stop time—an ability given increasing symbolic weight but no elaboration, and which he never puts to any use at all. And yet, somehow, amid or perhaps beneath the chaos, the film is constructed almost entirely from clichés. Its hero is a wild playboy who is also a moody genius with a tragic, secret past; he has fabulous wealth, a loyal majordomo/father figure, a confusing amount of political power (it makes more sense if you have read the back of The Power Broker, less if you have read the book), a mother who is never satisfied, and a Nobel Prize. He wants to remake his city—how is never exactly clear, though it involves more parks, and perhaps a new form of moving sidewalk—but is resisted by the elite, who are corrupt or depraved or both: the depraved ones do cocaine in spacious, well-lit nightclubs, and the corrupt skulk around in dark fedoras. The mayor, Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), is corrupt not in any particular actions but as a basic feature, the way some people are tall or left-handed. He has a pragmatic fixer named, the credits tell us, “Nush ‘the Fixer’ Berman,” as well as a beautiful, pure-hearted daughter, who falls in love with the hero and, slowly but surely, wins her father over to the hero’s cause. America is a decadent empire—like Rome, which is why the film’s version of New York is renamed New Rome, and why some (but not all) of the characters have Roman names and occasionally take part in Roman-ish activities. Here we encounter a strange phenomenon: a set of symbols so obvious they obscure the things they symbolize. The high and the low of New Rome gather in a coliseum to watch gladiators wrestle: What does this tell us about life in the nonfictional America, where actors, pop stars, and Donald Trump can be found cageside at UFC fights, while millions watch from home? (In case we’d forgotten the phrase “bread and circuses,” New Rome’s fights and chariot races are followed by a literal circus.) The festivities also include a set of “Vestal Virgins,” led by a singer named Vesta who is celebrated simultaneously for her sex appeal and her ostentatious chastity, and who later pivots to a bad-girl image after a scandal—which would all be quite illuminating, perhaps, if Britney Spears or Miley Cyrus had never existed. The film’s setting, too, is a chaotic rearrangement of the deeply familiar: not just ancient Rome added onto New York, but a version of New York that seems to exist simultaneously in the 1950s, 1980s, and 2020s. It’s a city of overcoats and flash drives, deep fakes and dusty municipal archives—all, one assumes, to indicate the timelessness of this “fable,” as the opening credits declare it. It is a confounding thing to watch. * In his notes about Fountain City—the 1,500-page novel, also about a visionary attempting to create a new urban utopia, that he worked on for years before finally abandoning—Michael Chabon uses the term draftitis to explain some of the book’s deficiencies. It “is a condition seen in manuscripts that have been rewritten several times,” he explains, especially “in passages where the writer has changed his or her mind,” a problem that “plagued me most often in my work as a screenwriter.” The problems might seem superficial, but they are “often a symptom of a more serious condition, namely authorial alienation.” That alienation seems to afflict much of Megalopolis. Coppola has, by his own account, been gathering material for the project for over forty years, and “must have rewritten it 300 times.” Much of the original research and conception was done in the 1980s, but Coppola’s first serious attempt to make it wasn’t until 2001; the film was well into preproduction when the September 11 attacks happened, putting it on hold again. (One plot point, strangely rushed past despite its importance, involves an old Soviet satellite plummeting from space and destroying a chunk of lower Manhattan.) It is hard not to think of this span of time while you watch, as characters, tones, and themes drift in and out erratically, like several different movies superimposed on one another. Even the grandest moments of spectacle and drama—a love scene on girders suspended above a glowing city, a political conspiracy breaking out into mob violence—come through as thin and muffled, as if we were watching them from far away. Advertisement Part of this is stylistic. In the decades since Coppola’s run of masterpieces in the 1970s—The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather Part II, Apocalypse Now—he has been looking for a way to make an entirely different sort of movie. “There are any number of styles one is able to choose in the movie business,” he complains in Live Cinema, “as long as it’s realism.” He means that word quite broadly, it seems, to include any film based around naturalistic lighting, lifelike sets, or location shooting. (There are plenty of definitions, after all, that would exclude all four of his most famous films: a pair of romanticized gangster epics, a paranoid thriller, and a surreal war movie.) Some of the work-for-hire he produced after he went bankrupt in the 1980s was necessarily in the traditional Hollywood mode, but the films on which he has had the most freedom have been marked by flamboyant artificiality: the glowing soundstage pseudo-Vegas of One from the Heart (1981), the anachronistic in-camera special effects of Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992), the fairytale dreamscapes of Twixt (2011). Lionsgate Nathalie Emmanuel as Julia Cicero and Adam Driver as Cesar Catilina in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 In his recent book The Path to Paradise: A Francis Ford Coppola Story—a partial biography, mainly focused on the shooting of Apocalypse Now and One from the Heart, with the production of Megalopolis acting as a frame—Sam Wasson explains this shift as a reaction to the chaos of Apocalypse Now.2 In that film, Wasson writes, Coppola “had had a hard time getting real life to look the way he wanted it to look.” (A droll understatement, for a location shoot that went months over schedule and millions over budget, killed a crew member and hospitalized its lead actor, and drove Coppola into near-breakdown and marital estrangement.) “Shooting at a studio,” as he did for One from the Heart, “it was easier to control all the elements of moviemaking—color, light, scenery, actors—the way a painter has to control every brushstroke on his canvas.” Or, perhaps, the way Cesar yearns to control his city. Megalopolis, likewise, was shot primarily on soundstages, and makes extensive use of digital backdrops. Any hint of the real world is carefully excluded, in favor of a glowing, golden-hued artificiality, otherworldly and airless in equal measure. Its backgrounds are never more than that, flat and distant from the actors no matter how many inventive flourishes are packed into them. Among other things, Wasson’s book offers a reminder of how intertwined Coppola’s career has been with that of George Lucas. Lucas’s very first job in Hollywood was as an assistant on Coppola’s 1968 musical, Finian’s Rainbow, and Coppola produced Lucas’s first two feature films, THX 1138 (1971) and American Graffiti (1973). They shared collaborators, most notably the editor and sound designer Walter Murch, and scripts (Lucas was at one point meant to direct Apocalypse Now). And both, as they became successful, attempted to change how movies were made: not just “pursuing similar if not identical goals in the advancement of post-production technology”—Coppola was a pioneer of electronic editing and quadrophonic sound mixing, as Lucas was of special effects—but creating their own alternatives to the studio system. Lucasfilm was a more staid, less artistically radical (and less financially reckless) endeavor than Coppola’s American Zoetrope, yet “we both have the same goals,” Lucas declared. “We both have the same ideas and we both have the same ambitions.” In fact, the closest thing there is to a precedent for Megalopolis is Lucas’s own high-budget passion project: the Star Wars prequels. They share with Coppola’s film a stultifying reliance on digital backgrounds. They share, too, a discordant mix of acting styles, as each performer struggles in their own way to deliver wooden, ridiculous dialogue—alongside Hayden Christensen’s “I don’t like sand. It’s coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere,” we now have Driver’s “Go back to the cluuub.” In both, the filmmaker was insulated, through sheer monetary abundance, from any and all interference, untethered from corporate dictates and collaborative compromise. But the Star Wars prequels are still grounded in a familiar fictional setting and guided by Lucas’s instincts as a showman—they are meant above all to entertain. Megalopolis is after something else, something more ambitious and inward. Advertisement * Wasson describes Coppola approaching filmmaking from the beginning of his career as a personal “rite of passage…each [project] lived by Coppola in tandem with his creation.” But most of his earlier works started with other people’s ideas: the Godfather films with Mario Puzo’s novel, Apocalypse Now and One from the Heart with preexisting scripts, not to mention the various hired-gun projects that followed. Someone else’s vision was always there for Coppola to struggle with and build on, however much he eventually made it his own. Lionsgate Grace Vanderwaal, center, as Vesta Sweetwater in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 His films this century—three small-scale features, which he has said “were meant to teach me what making movies really was,” and now Megalopolis—are more directly personal. Each contains at least some aspect drawn straight from his own life. The very first line of 2007’s Youth Without Youth (based on a novel by Mircea Eliade, his only recent film not a wholly original script) speaks to its director’s fears: “Sometimes,” the elderly protagonist declares, “I admit to myself that it’s possible I will never be able to finish my life’s work.” Much of the dramatic situation of Tetro (2009)—a younger brother estranged, as Coppola was, from the older brother he reveres, both siblings oppressed by an arrogant composer father much like the Coppolas’—matches his biography, right down to the father’s declaration that the family has room for only one genius, him. The climax of Twixt comes with a flashback to the death of the protagonist’s child in a boating accident, which is how Coppola’s eldest son was killed. In Megalopolis, Cesar’s airy penthouse office, where he dreams up his vision for a new city, seems modeled after the one on top of the Sentinel Building in San Francisco that Coppola had renovated after the success of The Godfather—a room “so beautiful…Coppola would tell [the designer] he wouldn’t let anyone photograph it,” Wasson reports. And Cesar’s Renaissance man workshop full of excited young people expresses Coppola’s dreams for American Zoetrope, a place where “everybody—all the filmmakers—could do whatever they wanted,” and where schoolchildren were brought in to learn film production firsthand. Even minor details turn out to be plucked from autobiography, like a brief appearance by two young reporters from The Dingbat News—which is the name of the schoolgirl newsletter Sofia Coppola and her friends wrote on the Zoetrope lot in the early 1980s. And yet, perversely, as his work has become more personal, at times nakedly autobiographical, it has also become less affecting. These moments, which should be moving or even heartbreaking, are instead melodramatic, campy, or just confusing. It is as if the deeper he has gone into his own experiences and emotions, the further he has left the rest of us behind. He’s down there somewhere; we can hear his voice, drifting up in fragments. * One word that comes through quite clearly is “ideas.” That, we have repeatedly been told, is what Megalopolis is really about. Coppola has spoken about all the books he drew from while working on it—Herman Hesse’s The Glass Bead Game, Stephen Greenblatt’s The Swerve, David Graeber’s Debt, Bullshit Jobs, and The Dawn of Everything, along with “everything I had ever read or learned about.” Mayor Cicero and Cesar are self-evidently meant to represent ideas of how to approach urban life, and life in general: the worldly and cynical (“People don’t need dreams, people need help now”) versus the idealistic (“Don’t let the now destroy the forever”), with the deck stacked heavily in favor of the latter. The ideas stop there. There is little discussion about how cities actually work, or could work; about how societies change, or might be changed; about history or government or anything else. Cesar’s utopian vision seems to consist of a few stray quotes from Shakespeare and Marcus Aurelius, a vague notion that rooms could change along with their inhabitants, and an affection for parks. His grand Megalopolis project, revealed at the end of the film, looks like a slightly vegetal remix of the Vessel, from New York’s Hudson Yards—a hideous tourist trap that has been repeatedly shut down after people killed themselves by jumping off it. Lionsgate Giancarlo Esposito as Mayor Cicero in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 If you stay for the credits, you might notice one for an “architectural and scientific advisor”: Neri Oxman, the designer and former MIT professor who, after Business Insider accused her of plagiarism this past January, was vigorously defended by her husband, the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Her “Man-Nahāta” project—a set of studies of the possible future of New York City, including a group of circular models exhibited at SFMOMA in 2022, commissioned by Coppola though essentially absent from the film—imagines the city overrun, in the coming centuries, not just by climate change but by great waves of jargon: “the city undergoes time-based decomposition, its organic substances breaking down into megalithic architectural elements.” Perusing the website of Oxman, the design firm she launched this fall, is almost as baffling as watching Megalopolis, as genuine environmental concerns disappear into the fog of sentences like “a generative design process that unites human-centric cultural typologies with Nature-centric needs to maximize ecological thriving.” One of the most discussed scenes in the film is a brief press conference Cesar holds, around the midpoint. At a few screenings, this moment involved a sudden outbreak of live performance: someone would emerge from the audience and ask a prewritten question into a microphone, to which Cesar would respond onscreen. Coppola’s original plan was to use a version of Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant to allow the actual audience to shout out questions, with the most relevant of several clips of Cesar answering then played in response—a plan that was abandoned after a wave of Amazon layoffs included the engineers who were working with Coppola. It’s an audacious idea, but the most shocking thing about this scene is how Cesar actually responds, no matter his questioner. “Is this society,” he asks, “is this way we’re living, the only one that’s available to us? And when we ask these questions, when there’s a dialogue about them, that basically is a utopia.” That, basically, is the level of thought this film provides. We get repeated gestures in the direction of ideas, or rather Ideas, restatements of the need for discussion, but no actual discussion—no details, no complications, no development. At some point over the years, Coppola seems to have lost touch not only with who these characters are and what kind of world they exist in, but with why any of this mattered in the first place. This is one of the most peculiar things about Megalopolis: it is so unusual, so packed with incident, and so clearly of such vast importance to its creator, yet it feels so empty. Sometime later, Cesar repeats himself: “We are in need of a great debate about the future!” he announces in the film’s finale, and it is never clearer that Coppola is speaking through him to us. But all he’s saying is that someone should say something. * Megalopolis might, in the end, be most intelligible not as an analysis but as a symptom. In the story of Cesar the misunderstood genius, the dictatorial apostle of dialogue, we can see glimpses of a very particular understanding of the world. This is what it looks like to a self-confident man of a certain sort: someone who has been rich and famous for over half his life, someone who is convinced of his own benevolence, who still sees himself as an outsider, who says things like “What I do is create chaos and then try to control it.” (It is true that Coppola went bankrupt in the middle of his career, but there are bankruptcies and there are bankruptcies, as Trump has taught us. Coppola’s was not the kind where you lose your health care or end up homeless, but the kind where you have to direct The Rainmaker.) This is evidently what he worries about and how he thinks things work. This is the world—this is us—seen from the top of the tower. It is a world, for instance, in which a few chosen people—artists, who are the same as scientists—can achieve almost anything, as long as they have a beautiful woman by their side to inspire them, and to run home and make dinner. (She may still be a professional subordinate, if it’s early in the relationship.) It’s a world in which true change is decided by a couple of men—rich, powerful, and probably related to each other—arguing across a very expensive table. A world in which democracy is, on those rare occasions when one is forced to acknowledge it, never anything more than a mob of idiots, manipulated by a few degenerates. A world in which powerful oratory—powerful enough, on one occasion, to completely subdue that mob—involves reciting Hamlet’s “to be or not to be” soliloquy in its entirety, and asking questions like “What is time?” There are times when Megalopolis feels like it should be set not in New York, or New Rome, but in Silicon Valley. Cesar’s gleaming vision of the future has a distinct air of the tech campus. His vague, unbounded genius seems an emanation from the ego of a very well-funded founder, the kind of man who employs so many scientists and engineers he starts to think he is both. At other times, the movie feels set in a hazy memory of New York, a storybook city of animate statues and sneering villains, waiting for a caring father to set things right. Lionsgate Aubrey Plaza as Wow Platinum in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 It is also a world in which there is nothing more dangerous than a sexy second wife. This is a subject on which the film becomes unusually coherent: the subplot in which the financial reporter Wow Platinum seduces and manipulates the rich, elderly banker Crassus and uses his wealth for her own spiteful ends is the most forceful and sustained section of the story. That Aubrey Plaza’s writhing, maniacal performance as Wow is delightful does not change what a tired, misogynistic caricature she is, a barely human creature of lust and viciousness. She is also the only major character who is killed, and quite brutally. One might notice, as well, that this is a world in which sex scandals turn out to be bullshit—just another speed bump thrown up by the haters. When Cesar’s enemies accuse him of statutory rape, the charges are doubly dismissed: not only was the sex tape a deep fake, but the girl was lying about her age and was actually in her twenties all along. Here we might remember a few things: that the index to Wasson’s book has entries under “Coppola, Francis Ford, infidelity of,” including an account of a long-term relationship in the 1970s with an assistant; that he has declared that he intentionally cast “canceled” actors in Megalopolis, such as Jon Voight and Shia LaBeouf, to avoid it being “deemed some woke Hollywood production”; and that he has been accused by an extra of sexual harassment on the set of the film—which he has vigorously denied, and over which he has since sued Variety, which reported the allegations, for $15 million. Or perhaps a few of us might remember something he said back in 2006, when asked about Victor Salva, a filmmaker he supported professionally both before and after Salva was convicted of molesting a child actor while filming his first feature, Clownhouse (1989). “You have to remember,” Coppola told a reporter, “while this was a tragedy, that the difference in age between Victor and the boy was very small—Victor was practically a child himself.” Salva was twenty-nine years old at the time of the crime, his victim twelve. There may, in the end, be a benefit to Megalopolis’s chronic draftitis. With its long and messy gestation, it unintentionally tracks some of the most destructive changes of the past half-century: the smooth slide of countercultural idealism into technocratic arrogance, the ascent of the very rich into a cuckooland of mushy pseudo-thought and thin-skinned vindictiveness, the decay of Great Man hero worship into misogynistic backlash. Watching this film is a very effective—and very useful—reminder of how inimical extreme wealth is to democratic thinking, to clear thinking in general, and to basic human sympathy. “If I could leave you with one thought after you see my new film,” Coppola wrote in a statement that accompanied early screenings of Megalopolis, “it would be this: Our founders borrowed a Constitution, Roman Law, and Senate for their revolutionary government without a king, so American History could neither have taken place nor succeed as it did without classical learning to guide it.” For better or for worse, I doubt a single member of its audience has left the theater with that in mind. The more sympathetic might be thinking of the pathos of an octogenarian director devoting his millions to a story about a man who can stop time. Others might be laughing at the headline, briefly glimpsed in a montage, declaring “TEEN PREGNANCY SKYROCKETS!” or wondering at the genuinely astonishing shot, late in the film, of a pregnant woman underwater who turns out to be an image painted onto human bodies, and changes when they move. Or they might be thinking of Wow, and wondering who the real Cesars will vote for on Tuesday.

After a whirlwind week of tech earnings, it’s time to take a deep breath and fasten your seat belts again for another big ride. This week is expected to be intense, high-stakes, and perhaps exhausting as Americans head to the polls to decide the country’s 47th president. Election Day falls on Tuesday, Nov. 5. Hopefully, by the end of the week, the world will know who will lead the nation — Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. Current polls show an incredibly close race, suggesting a tight contest that could bring volatility to markets and emotions alike. The historic event will likely impact market sentiment, and investors will need to stay tuned to stock market movements and macroeconomic indicators. Election outcomes can significantly affect the market’s direction, shaping policies that impact industries, fiscal policy, and international relations. As results unfold, expect heightened activity in the markets and prepare for potential shifts in market strategy based on the election’s outcome. Palantir Technologies (PLTR+0.76%) is set to release its earnings report on Monday after the market closes. Known for its advanced AI tools used by military and intelligence agencies, Palantir has become a prominent player amid the tech world’s ongoing AI surge. Super Micro Computer (SMCI+12.25%), which faces the threat of delisting from the Nasdaq, is expected to report on Tuesday, although the exact timing remains unconfirmed. On Wednesday, Novo Nordisk (NVO+2.18%) and CVS Health (CVS-7.27%) will announce their earnings before the opening bell. Later that day, AMC Entertainment (AMC-6.00%), a popular “meme stock,” and QUALCOMM (QCOM-0.05%), a key player in wireless technology, will release their results after the market closes. Airbnb (ABNB+4.74%) is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday after the market closes, shedding light on its performance amid shifting travel trends. Finally, on Friday, Paramount Global (PARA+1.41%) and Trump Media & Technology (DJT-22.88%) will release their earnings, providing insights into their standing within the media and social media landscapes, respectively. This week, several significant macroeconomic reports are scheduled for release, beginning on Tuesday with the U.S. trade deficit figures for September. This data is crucial for understanding the country’s trade dynamics and overall economic health. On Thursday, two important reports will be issued: the weekly initial jobless claims and the consumer credit report for September. Moreover, investors will closely monitor the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate decision, as well as the subsequent press conference featuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell. This announcement will be pivotal in shaping market expectations regarding monetary policy and interest rates. Finally, on Friday, the preliminary consumer sentiment index will be released, offering a glimpse into consumer confidence levels. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: SMCI rating suspended, ARM stock downgraded

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Wedbush analysts said this week they feel “more bullish” about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock, despite the mixed reactions following the tech giant’s latest earnings report. Microsoft posted first-quarter results that exceeded expectations, driven by robust growth in Azure. The cloud service reported a 34% year-over-year growth in constant currency, surpassing forecasts by 100 basis points. AI growth played a key role, contributing a 12% boost compared to 8% in the previous quarter. This performance underlined strong AI monetization trends that continue to support Microsoft's core cloud business. Despite these results, Microsoft shares fell Thursday, impacted by guidance for Azure’s December quarter growth in constant currency, projected at 31%-32%, which fell short of the most bullish investor expectations. Wedbush analysts, led by Dan Ives, pushed back against the negative interpretation, stating they “disagree with this initial take.” “The new Azure reporting standards have moved Street numbers all around and a slight deceleration is totally expected by many investors with some supply constraints and reacceleration in 2H25 and we would be strong buyers of MSFT on any weakness this morning,” Ives noted. The analysts emphasized that December’s headline figures were solid, particularly in the core Intelligent Cloud segment. Any observed weakness was attributed to softer PC demand, which they described as “background noise” in the context of Microsoft’s broader cloud and AI growth. “We come away from this quarter more bullish (not less) after seeing this AI growth and Copilot monetization play out in real time for Microsoft. The bears will try to split hairs on any number but ultimately this is a tech stalwart in major growth mode,” analysts continued. Barclays analysts noted that shares of Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) could face volatility in the near term, despite the company’s strong third-quarter earnings report. Alphabet reported revenue and earnings per share (EPS) that surpassed consensus estimates by 2% and 15%, respectively. Revenue from Search and YouTube matched expectations, while the Cloud segment delivered a notable outperformance. Barclays pointed out that the transition to the new CFO went smoothly, though investors remain keen for more detailed insights into the company's operations. Given Alphabet’s ongoing legal issues, the company’s continued “high-level communication philosophy” was not unexpected, according to the analysts. The regulatory environment is likely to draw renewed attention in the coming weeks, as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) plans to present a proposed remedy package ahead of the Department of Justice’s (DoJ) specific requests. This could impact the stock’s performance. Because of this, analysts indicated that “the upside for GOOGL shares near-term is somewhat capped.” “The 20x EPS multiple reflects some of the regulatory and AI-related risks, which we continue to muddle through ever so slowly,” they added. Bernstein analysts downgraded their rating for Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) to Underperform from Market Perform, pointing to near-term “cyclical headwinds” that could impact the chip designer. While acknowledging that the long-term equity story for Arm remains “very appealing,” the analysts voiced concerns about the company’s revenue prospects outside of the artificial intelligence space. They cited challenges affecting industries such as automaking and technology, which heavily depend on processors built using Arm’s designs. “Putting all of this together, we do not believe that Arm is immune to these cyclical headwinds when it comes to royalties, specifically — although the long term story remains very attractive in our view,” the analysts wrote. Ahead of the company’s quarterly results set for November 6, Bernstein subsequently lowered its expectations for Arm’s royalties and licensing income. The UK-based company derives royalties from each chip sold using its technology, along with licensing fees for its semiconductor designs. The analysts also revised down their fiscal year 2025 revenue target for Arm. They noted that the company’s current stock valuation, at 45 times 2026 fully-diluted earnings per share, is “too steep.” Rosenblatt Securities has suspended its rating, price target, and estimates for Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock following recent developments. More concretely, the AI server manufacturer recently revealed in an 8-K filing that Ernst & Young (EY) resigned as its registered public accounting firm last week. According to the filing, the move was triggered by issues related to governance, transparency, and the completeness of communications from Super Micro to EY, alongside concerns about internal controls over financial reporting. In its resignation letter, EY stated that it was “unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management.” The firm also highlighted concerns regarding the board’s independence from CEO Charles Liang and “other members of management.” Super Micro has since begun the search for a new accounting firm and noted that it does not expect to restate its financials for fiscal year 2024 or prior periods. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann commented, “Due to the changes undergoing at EY, we believe EY may also be removing itself from riskier profile projects.” He added, “Given the uncertainty surrounding the company's financials, we are suspending our rating, price target, and estimates on Super Micro until we have an outcome that can determine our recommendation.” According to Needham & Company analysts, Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) is the one stock that has yet to fully realize the potential benefits from the AI-driven market shift. The firm recently issued a Buy rating on Qorvo and set a price target of $135, seeing the semiconductor company as undervalued. Needham suggests that Qorvo’s current valuation does not yet capture the anticipated “AI-driven super cycle in CY25,” which could transform the smartphone market. The analysts pointed out that Qorvo’s valuation compared to the semiconductor index (SOXX) is at multi-year lows, presenting a “compelling risk/reward” opportunity as sentiment in the mobile market shows potential for improvement. “Management has been confident for several quarters regarding content gains in FY25 and FY26,” Needham noted, particularly with its major customer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Additional opportunities could emerge if the AI-enabled smartphone product cycle gathers momentum. Despite positive signs in the smartphone market, Needham believes that an AI premium has yet to be factored into Qorvo’s valuation, given the conservative estimates for CY25. While global smartphone unit growth is expected, “our CY25 unit estimates are flattish, giving upside to any type of AI-driven super cycle,” the note stated. This indicates potential for upward revisions in both Apple and Android product lines as AI adoption accelerates.
