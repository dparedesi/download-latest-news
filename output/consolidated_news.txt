Elon Musk is riding high again after a rough start to the year. The Tesla CEO's net worth crashed from $229 billion at the start of January to $164 billion by late April, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The $65 billion decline was fueled by Tesla stock tanking more than 40% in that period. However, shares of the EV maker have surged by over 80% from their April low, driving a more than $100 billion increase in Musk's wealth to $270 billion at Wednesday's close. That includes an almost $50 billion rise since August 7, when Musk's fortune stood at an estimated $223 billion. The epic comeback means Musk went from being the world's biggest wealth loser for the year in April, to the fourth-greatest gainer with a $41 billion increase. Only Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison have grown their net worth more. Musk also remains easily the richest person on the planet with a $270 billion fortune — worth more than corporate titans like Salesforce ($262 billion), PepsiCo ($233 billion), or McDonald's ($216 billion). Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, worth $215 billion, and Zuckerberg, worth $202 billion, still trail him by a distance. Yet it's worth noting that Musk has been much richer in the past. In November 2021, he was worth an astounding $340 billion. Tesla stock is down nearly 40% from there, leaving Musk about $70 billion poorer than at his peak. Musk's wealth rebound this year reflects renewed optimism about not just Tesla but the wider stock market and US economy. The Federal Reserve recently made its first cut to interest rates after hiking them from nearly zero to north of 5% in under 16 months, pushing stocks to record highs and easing inflation and recession fears. The Tesla chief warned last year that soaring prices, steeper rates, and a looming downturn were bad news for his company. Consumers had less disposable income to spend on a car, buying one had become more costly and difficult due to higher borrowing costs and stricter lending, and people may have been holding off buying a new car until the economy improved, he said. In April, Musk announced sweeping layoffs, Tesla published disappointing first-quarter delivery numbers, and investors fretted about price cuts squeezing profit margins and Chinese rivals like BYD taking market share from Tesla. Those myriad concerns tanked the stock, but signs of easing economic pressures have underpinned a recovery in recent weeks. It's worth noting that Musk's vast fortune also reflects his roughly 42% ownership of SpaceX, the rocket company valued at $210 billion in June, and his stakes in X, Neuralink, xAI, and The Boring Company.

Micron Technology (MU) shares surged Thursday after the memory chip maker's revenue and outlook blew past expectations, leading Nvidia (NVDA) and other semiconductor stocks higher. Shares of Micron were up over 12% in intraday trading, while shares of partner Nvidia (NVDA) also gained before reversing course. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) rose as well, boosting the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Nvidia, Micron, and other chip companies have seen their revenue and stock prices climb amid a boom in demand for infrastructure to support artificial intelligence (AI). Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said Wednesday the company's fiscal fourth-quarter sales nearly doubled from a year ago to $7.75 billion, driven by "robust AI demand." Mehrotra also said the company's sales are expected to continue growing, projecting current-quarter revenue could reach a record high between $8.5 billion to $8.9 billion.

Plus: How Phillip Morris International is rehabilitating nicotine’s image with the wildly popular flavored Zyn pouches, which are more profitable than PMI’s cigarette division. Good morning, Sixty-two years after Sam Walton opened the first Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas, its spectacular success has minted his eldest son as a centibillionaire. Rob Walton became the first member of America’s richest family to hold a 12-figure fortune, worth an estimated $100 billion. Shoppers have flocked to the budget retailer amid high inflation, sending Walmart’s shares up 53% year-to-date. Just 15 other people are worth $100 billion or more, including Elon Musk and Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang. With Walmart’s stock market tear, Rob’s siblings Jim and Alice may soon join him in this elite club. Illustration by Alex Castro; Icons by Noun Project A Forbes review of Facebook found nearly 800 groups offering to connect women to abortion remedies—at least 300 of which operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal, or even a criminal offense. But the groups are something of a double-edged sword, says Katy Mayall, the director for strategic initiatives at the Center for Reproductive Rights. While they may get some women help, they can be a gateway to scams and fraudsters and carry health and privacy risks for people in restrictive countries. New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on federal criminal charges by a grand jury Wednesday night, capping a series of federal corruption investigations against him and several high-ranking members of his administration. In a defiant video statement shortly before the indictment was reported, Adams said the charges were “entirely false, based on lies” and dismissed calls for him to resign, saying the people of New York “elected me to lead this city, and lead it I will.” Home mortgage rates are posted outside a real estate office in Los Angeles. Since the Federal Reserve’s major interest rate cut last week, yields for 10-year Treasury notes, the benchmark for loans like mortgages and auto rates, have actually increased. Now expectations have shifted for the Fed to enact another big cut amid mounting evidence that the economy needs even more of a jolt. Coinbase, the largest publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in the world, has custody of 11% of all Bitcoin tokens. Now, Brian Armstrong, the company’s chief executive and cofoun­der, wants to disrupt his money machine—the key to that pivot is Base, a system designed to improve upon Ethereum’s blockchain by potentially speeding up transactions. A Delaware court extended an order stalling Bolt founder Ryan Breslow’s bid to raise $450 million, characterizing the deal as a “prisoner’s dilemma” for investors. It’s the latest snag in Breslow’s ongoing bid to raise fresh capital for the struggling payments company, as three irate Bolt investors requested the halt on the Series F financing round—including the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock. The Senate voted 78-18 to approve legislation Wednesday to continue funding the government through December 20, narrowly averting a shutdown just five days before the deadline. The short-term spending deal still requires lawmakers to either hash out a funding deal or pass another extension in December, about six weeks after Election Day. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin (D-Md.) was the target of a sophisticated spoofing operation where a video caller used deepfake imagery to pose as a high-level Ukrainian official, according to multiple reports late Wednesday. In a notice reported by NBC News, the Senate security office warned lawmakers about an “active social engineering campaign ... targeting Senators and Senate staff.” President Joe Biden said he was not forced out of the presidential race in his first sit-down interview since his historic decision to end his campaign in July. Biden said on ABC’s The View that he always saw himself as a “transition president,” but insisted he would have beaten former President Donald Trump. The Israeli military is reportedly considering a ground invasion into Lebanon, amid an escalating conflict with Hezbollah that has killed hundreds and threatens to turn into a full-blown war. Late Wednesday, the U.S., France and several key allies issued a statement calling for an immediate 21-day cease-fire, noting that the conflict “presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he has not yet responded to the “U.S.-French proposal” and has “instructed the IDF to continue fighting with full force.” Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Since hedge fund Elliott Investment Management, run by billionaire activist investor Paul Singer, announced in June it had taken a $1.9 billion stake in Southwest Airlines, the carrier has made policy changes, upended its board and had its chairman resign. But it’s apparently not enough: On Tuesday, the hedge fund announced it would call for a special meeting at Southwest Airlines “in the coming weeks.” In a letter to shareholders, Elliott accuses Southwest’s leadership of obstructing a leadership change with “a chaotic series of defensive actions.” Illustration by Alex Castro for Forbes; Photos by Helmut Hess, Michael M. Santiago : Getty Images TOPLINE Philip Morris International is rehabilitating nicotine’s image with its wildly in-demand flavored Zyn pouches, embraced by celebrities, entrepreneurs and star athletes. By the end of 2024, PMI, which owns Zyn manufacturer Swedish Match, expects to sell as much as 580 million cans of Zyn, a 50% increase over the 385 million sold last year. Forbes estimates that Zyn sales, which PMI does not break out in public filings, generated $1.3 billion last year (about 3.7% of PMI’s $35 billion in total revenue) and could hit $1.9 billion this year. Zyn is six times more profitable than PMI’s cigarette division, says Bonnie Herzog, an analyst for Goldman Sachs who covers the tobacco industry. And unlike cigarettes, which have been steadily declining in volume for the last decade, Zyn is in hypergrowth mode. Shipment volume in the U.S. has jumped a staggering 238% since 2020. But while pouches have successfully divorced nicotine from the cigarette, they still have health risks. Plus, the FDA has not authorized them for sale, although Swedish Match filed an application in March 2020. This means the products are technically illegal, but the FDA is allowing them to stay on the market while the agency reviews applications. And at least five lawsuits allege that PMI is marketing Zyn to minors. “Zyn is Juul 2.0,” says Scott Schlesinger, a Florida-based attorney who recently filed a class action against PMI and Swe­dish Match. But Stacey Kennedy, head of PMI’s U.S. operations, insists that PMI is marketing Zyn only to adults who already smoke or use nicotine. “I think Zyn is proof that nicotine can be used [to replace] more harmful products,” she says. WHY IT MATTERS “Zyn has become a runaway success for PMI. Its newest nicotine product will generate nearly $2 billion in sales this year, Forbes estimates,” says staff writer Will Yakowicz. “But the nicotine pouch is more than just a financial juggernaut—Zyn has spawned its own culture online (also known as the Zynternet), with viral memes and celebrities touting the brand. And it has even entered the presidential election: Ohio Senator JD Vance has been photographed holding a container of Zyn, while on the other side of the aisle, Tim Walz levied a 95% tax on Zyn and other nicotine products as governor of Minnesota.” MORE Meet The Kings Of The Pre-Roll Joint Ozempic may lower the risk of opioid overdose in patients with Type 2 diabetes, a new study suggests. It’s the latest research showing the drug’s positive impact on an unrelated condition: Around 3,000: The number of study participants with Type 2 diabetes and opioid use disorder who were prescribed semaglutide (the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy) About 60%: The decrease in opioid overdoses associated with semaglutide 107,543: The number of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2023, per CDC data, with opioid-related overdoses making up more than 81,000 of those deaths Soft skills, such as your ability to communicate, are just as critical in your career as hard skills like coding or graphic design. Some of the most important soft skills are public speaking, knowing how to sell and negotiate and project management. Self-awareness might be the most critical: Knowing your strengths and what you need to improve on will help you make real progress in both your personal and professional life.

Micron Technology's (MU) bullish outlook is driving its and chipmaking peers' shares higher in premarket trading; Costco Wholesale (COST) is expected to post both quarterly profit and sales gains after the bell; Meta Platforms (META) stock adds to record highs; OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization and give Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sam Altman a massive stake; and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell makes his first remarks today after last week's supersized interest-rate cut. U.S. stock futures—especially the tech-dominated Nasdaq—are rising on Micron's rosy outlook after indexes closed mixed Wednesday. Here's what investors need to know today. Micron Technology (MU) shares are jumping 16% in premarket trading after the memory chipmaker's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit in its fiscal fourth quarter and almost doubled revenue, buoyed by "robust AI demand," according to CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. Micron's results lifted other chipmakers and semiconductor industry suppliers, with ASML Holding (ASML) jumping 4% and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia all up about 2%. Costco Wholesale (COST) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts projecting year-over-year growth on the top and bottom lines. It will be the retailer's first results since it raised its membership fees for the first time in seven years. Analysts are projecting very little further appreciation for the shares, which are edging higher in premarket trading and have climbed nearly 40% this year. Meta Platforms (META) shares, which hit an all-time high Wednesday, are rising a further 2% in premarket trading after the company unveiled new products at its annual Connect conference. In his keynote address, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a lower-cost Quest 3S headset, Orion augmented reality glasses, new features for its smart glasses made in partnership with Ray-Ban, and new AI features, among other things. OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization, as the Microsoft (MSFT)-backed company struggles with an ongoing exodus of key personnel. According to Reuters, which first reported the plan, OpenAI is in talks to give CEO Sam Altman equity worth up to $150 billion, while Bloomberg said the company is discussing giving him a 7% stake. Meanwhile, OpenAI's long-serving Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Mira Murati was among those to announce a departure Wednesday. It's a big day for Federal Reserve speakers, among them Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at the 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference. Powell's speech will be his first since announcing last week's jumbo-sized interest-rate cut. Investors will also be on the lookout for comments from New York Fed President John Williams and Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr on the health of the U.S. economy. Data due today include a revised estimate of second-quarter GDP.

OPEC+ initially planned to begin unwinding part of the 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude production cuts from October this year. However, after oil prices crashed in late August and early September, OPEC+ delayed the start of the unwinding of the cuts by two months until December 2024. According to Novak, Russia’s top oil official and representative at the OPEC+ meetings, the group, at present, isn’t looking to make any changes to its current production plan. In addition, the Russian official claimed that all OPEC+ producers are currently in full compliance with the agreed output quotas. “All countries are generally fulfilling their obligations under the agreement. We are observing and monitoring the situation on the market in terms of the balance of supply and demand,” Russian news agency Interfax quoted Novak as saying on the sidelines of an energy conference in Russia. Earlier today, reports emerged that Saudi Arabia is determined to begin bringing back production as of December 1, as it now seeks to regain the market share it had lost over the past months with its large output cut. Saudi Arabia is willing to endure short-term oil price and revenue pain as it is making a U-turn in policy and going to take back market share and ditching its unofficial $100 oil price target, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, quoting sources with knowledge of the latest Saudi thinking. This latest thinking suggests that the Kingdom has come to accept that it would have to endure a period of lower oil prices if it wants to take market share back.

Title: BlackRock Continues To Buy Bitcoin: Holdings Now Reach 358,000 BTC Worth $22 Billion

Full Content:
In less than nine months since the launch of its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) following the approval of these investment vehicles by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asset manager BlackRock has established itself as the world’s largest Bitcoin fund. According to on-chain data from blockchain analysis platform Arkham, BlackRock has aggressively expanded its Bitcoin holdings through its ETF, known as IBIT over the last months. Despite recent market volatility that saw significant dips in Bitcoin’s price on August 5 and September 6, BlackRock continued to buy more Bitcoin, thereby supporting not only the token’s value but also its own asset base. As of September 25, BlackRock’s holdings have reached approximately 358,000 BTC, valued at around $22.76 billion, representing about 1.70% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million. In comparison, BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings exceed those of Grayscale, another major crypto asset manager in the industry, by nearly 100,000 BTC. Grayscale currently holds approximately 258,671 BTC, valued at $16.45 billion, highlighting the significant gap that BlackRock has created in the BTC investment landscape. While BlackRock has taken a commanding lead in Bitcoin, Grayscale maintains an advantage in Ethereum (ETH) holdings. Arkham’s data indicates that Grayscale possesses 2.104 million ETH, valued at roughly $5.45 billion based on the current trading price of $2,600 per ETH. In contrast, BlackRock’s Ethereum holdings amount to only 349,970 ETH, valued at approximately $910 million. BlackRock’s support for Bitcoin extends beyond mere investment; it includes a strong endorsement of the technology underpinning the cryptocurrency. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Robbie Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, challenged the prevailing notion that Bitcoin should be categorized as a “risk-on” asset. During Tuesday’s interview, Mitchnick noted that while Bitcoin has recently shown a high correlation with US equities, this relationship may be misleading. The head of digital assets at BlackRock noted that risk-on assets, such as stocks, commodities, and high-yield bonds, perform well during periods of market optimism and economic growth. Conversely, assets like gold are sought after in times of uncertainty, providing a safe haven for investors. Mitchnick drew parallels between Bitcoin and gold, saying “gold shows a lot of the same patterns”, referring to their temporary correlations with equities. He emphasized that the long-term correlation between BTC and traditional financial assets is close to zero. One of BTC’s defining characteristics is its decentralized nature, Mitchnick added. No single country or government controls it, he said, which adds to its appeal as a global monetary alternative. Mitchnick went on to highlight Bitcoin’s scarcity, global reach and decentralized framework, describing it as a “non-sovereign asset”. He pointed out that BTC has no specific country risk and no counterparty risk, making it a compelling option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has given back some of the gains made during Tuesday’s trading session, after hitting a one-month high of $64,700. Currently, BTC is trading at $63,220, down a slight 0.3% over the 24-hour period.

“We’re at a really exci­ting moment for crypto,” enthuses Brian Armstrong, chief executive and cofoun­der of Coinbase, the largest publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in the world. “There is a shift happening from crypto being primarily an asset class that people want to trade to speculate on to it becoming more and more used for daily utility,” he insists. “Four hundred million people or so have used crypto globally.” That’s debatable. When it comes to crypto, most people care about pri­ces, and those have been on a tear lately. Bitcoin has more than doubled in the last year to around $58,000. More than 20 crypto ETFs holding $54 billion in digital assets are trading in the U.S. Crypto is more widely held than ever and has become an important topic in the presidential election. With Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried now both in prison, Armstrong has emerged as the movement’s most prominent spokesperson. Photo by Cody Pickens for Forbes Given that Coinbase’s stock mirrors trading in Bitcoin, Armstrong is a billionaire seven times over at age 41. The crypto­currency exchange he cofounded 12 years ago to become the “Gmail for Bitcoin” has a market capitalization of $40 billion and crypto assets under its custody of $270 billion. That includes holding more than $20 billion for BlackRock ($10 trillion in assets under management), now the world’s largest crypto ETF provider. In 2023, the company, which makes around half of its money from trading fees, netted $95 million on revenue of $3.1 billion. This year is on track to be much better: In the first six months of 2024, Coinbase’s revenue amounted to $3.1 billion but net income soared to $1.2 billion. If there were such a thing as a “Too Big to Fail” institution in the world of digital assets, Coinbase would be it. Just in terms of Bitcoin, Coinbase has custody of 11% of all tokens in existence. For crypto’s second-most important currency, Ether, its share is even larger at an estimated 14% of all tokens. If Coinbase imploded, the consequences could be catastrophic. Not everyone is a fan. In June 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase for acting as an unregistered exchange, broker-dealer and clearing firm—all activities it engages in for more than 14,500 institutions, as well as 8 million active retail customers. The case is likely to go to trial in 2025. Crypto evangelists hate the idea of centralized power, but operationally, Coinbase is more similar to other command-and-control financial institutions like JPMorgan than it is to something like an employee-owned credit union. Its main businesses are trading, custody and co-mana­ging (with Circle) a huge ($35 billion) stablecoin operation that pegs the value of the USDC token to the U.S. dollar. Coinbase’s dominant position allows it to charge high fees. Purchasing $5,000 of Bitcoin on the exchange will cost you $90. On Kraken it costs $20, and on Robinhood it’s free. But Armstrong is a crypto idealist, and he isn’t entirely happy with this state of affairs. He wants to disrupt his money machine, creating a whole new infrastructure for rapid-fire transactions, which will not only lower fees but also weaken the control of big tech and financial firms. “The whole reason I got into this and the mission of Coinbase is around increasing economic freedom in the world,” he says. “The vision here is that crypto is going to power more and more of global GDP. [It will] create sound money, sound financial infrastructure for people all over the world with lower fees, lower friction.” The key element in Armstrong’s latest corporate push is Base, which launched in August 2023. Base is a so-called Layer 2 platform. Instead of being a self-sufficient blockchain like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, it is designed to improve upon Ethereum by potentially processing thousands of transactions per second, costing less than a cent each. Ethereum can handle only about a dozen transactions per second, each costing an average of $1. It’s a huge improvement, but still far less than existing financial networks. Visa’s global processing network, VisaNet, can handle 65,000 transactions a second. Armstrong would like his low-cost Base to be interoperable with other Ethereum-based blockchains and support decentralized versions of Facebook, YouTube, Google, Uber and X. He’s also onboarding merchants ranging from Anheuser-Busch to Wharton business school using his Coinbase Commerce service, taking aim at the likes of PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, which charge fees as high as 3% per transaction. Coinbase Commerce charges only 1%. But consumer adoption has been slow. The network processes fewer than 2,000 transactions daily. Visa does that many every second. “Some of these businesses might have only 5% margins, and 2% of it is going to the card network,” Armstrong says. “There’s no reason it needs to be this way. It’s an unnecessary tax on the economy.” According to Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau, Base’s estimated 1 million active users are expec­ted to contribute $100 million to Coinbase’s revenue in 2024. Most of that is from trading fees (this is crypto, after all). Ironically, if Coinbase is going to be even more successful with Base, it will have to give up control—and share fees. Coinbase is currently Base’s only “sequencer,” crypto jargon for operator or supervisor. To become decentralized, Base will require more sequencers. If Base had four sequen­cers, Coinbase might earn only 25% of the total fees. Talk of lower fees and revenue dilution may not win Coinbase long-term fans on Wall Street. In the short term, shareholders don’t seem to mind. Shares of Coinbase have nearly doubled in the last 12 months. As long as the price of crypto keeps soaring—and the geeks keep tra­ding it—Armstrong can spout as much idealistic claptrap as he wants.

Title: Nvidia Stock -- The Road To $200

Visitors check out Nvidia's AI technology at the 2024 Apsara Conference in Hangzhou, China, on ... [+] September 19, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Could Nvidia stock reach $200 in the next two years? We think there is a possibility. How? Consider this, just about nine months ago, at the end of December 2023, Nvidia stock was trading at around $50 levels. This year the stock has grown over 2x since and trades at close to $116 presently. Looking at valuations, Nvidia stock trades at about 95x trailing earnings. Is this pricey? Not really. Especially if you consider the company’s steadily expanding earnings, the long-growth runway for the artificial intelligence market, and Nvidia’s formidable lead in the accelerated computing market. The Fed’s recent rate cut could also provide a boost as investors seek growth opportunities in a low-rate environment. In the scenario below, we use Nvidia’s revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $200 stock price. Nvidia’s revenues grew by close to 3x over the last 12 months, while notching an average annual growth rate of about 55% over the last three years, and the momentum can hold up. If Nvidia grows its sales at an average annual rate of over 60% for the next two years, its revenues could move from around $61 billion in FY’24 to around $155 billion by fiscal year 2026 or over 2.5x. There are several trends that could drive continued growth. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3-D calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Moreover, unlike a decade or so ago when advancements in computing power, particularly with processors, outpaced the development software that could fully utilize these capabilities, in the AI era, the demand for computing power has skyrocketed due to the intense computational requirements of machine learning models. This trend could result in sustained strong demand for Nvidia. Moreover, last week’s monetary easing by the Federal Reserve could provide an additional boost to Nvidia. The Fed’s 0.5% rate cut last Wednesday marked the first interest rate cut in close to four years. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move? With the benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Lower rates are typically beneficial for growth sectors including technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years, as lower discount rates boost the present value of future earnings. The lower rates are particularly beneficial to Nvidia. Why? Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia which sells GPUs for servers. Moreover, the economics of the AI revolution remain mixed, given the high costs of model training and inferencing. A drop in interest rates could improve the financial feasibility of these investments. Now the stock markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, the assumption is that demand growth and pricing power will hold up and profits will remain sizable as the generative AI wave advances. However, there are multiple risks and there remains a real possibility that the stock could see a sizable correction. We detail this possibility in our analysis of Nvidia’s downside to $40. Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock. To put things in perspective, NVDA stock swelled over 800% from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $130 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA’s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular, as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Combine this solid revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory. They grew from levels of about 25% in FY 2019 to about 49% in FY 2024 as the company sees better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also trending higher. We can assume that margins will remain flat at current levels as Nvidia’s launch of pricier higher-end products such as the Blackwell chips are offset by potential competitive pressures. Now, if earnings grow 2.5x, the PE multiple will shrink by 2.5x to levels of about 40x, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Nvidia investors are betting won’t happen. If earnings expand 2.5x over the next few years, instead of the PE shrinking from a figure around 95x now to about 40x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 65x looks quite likely. This would make the growth of Nvidia’s stock about $200 within the next two years or so a real possibility. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes 2 years or 3, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly.

William R. Keating, the congress member representing Massachusetts's 9th congressional district, recently made several transactions from his Individual Retirement Account (IRA), as per the latest congressional trade report. Among the most notable transactions, Keating sold a portion of his holdings in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Inc. Common Stock (NYSE:CAT) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) N.V. - Common Stock (NASDAQ:NXPI). Both transactions were valued between $1,001 and $15,000. In addition to the above, Keating also partially sold his holdings in several corporate securities, including those from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) & Co, Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Elevance Health Inc, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, Lowe's Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, T-Mobile USA Inc, Union Pacific Corp (NYSE:UNP), and Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ). Each of these transactions was valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Interestingly, two transactions stood out with a higher value. Keating partially sold his holdings in a Comcast Corp note, valued between $15,001 and $50,000. Furthermore, he sold his United States Treasury Series C-2032 note, also valued between $15,001 and $50,000. All transactions were conducted on September 11, 2024, and were reported on September 23, 2024. These trades, as per the report, were made from Keating's IRA, an investment vehicle commonly used by individuals to earmark funds for retirement savings. As investors keep a keen eye on the financial activities of influential figures like congress members, these transactions by Keating provide useful insights. However, as always, it's essential for investors to conduct their own research and consider various factors before making investment decisions. As William R. Keating adjusts his investment portfolio, it's worth noting the recent performance and outlook of Caterpillar, Inc. (NYSE:CAT), one of the stocks he has sold. According to InvestingPro data, Caterpillar has a robust market capitalization of $183.7 billion and has been demonstrating financial resilience. The company's P/E ratio stands at 17.2, reflecting a valuation that is attractive relative to near-term earnings growth, an observation that aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting the company's low P/E ratio in the context of its earnings growth. Investors tracking dividend reliability will find Caterpillar's dividend history compelling, as the company has not only maintained dividend payments for an impressive 54 consecutive years but has also raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years. This consistency in rewarding shareholders is a testament to the company's financial stability and commitment to returning value to its investors, a point that is underscored by two separate InvestingPro Tips. For those looking at stock performance, Caterpillar has delivered a strong return over the last three months, with a price total return of 16.0%. This robust short-term performance is part of a longer trend, as the company has also enjoyed a high return over the last decade. Caterpillar's operational strength is further reflected in its gross profit margin of 32.72% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating a healthy ability to manage costs and sustain profitability. For investors interested in a deeper dive into Caterpillar's financials and performance metrics, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights. There are currently 15 InvestingPro Tips available for Caterpillar, which provide a comprehensive analysis for those looking to make informed investment decisions.

Title: TSMC shares hold as JPMorgan reiterates overweight rating
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/tsmc-shares-hold-as-jpmorgan-reiterates-overweight-rating-93CH-3633434
Time Published: 2024-09-26T09:44:14Z
Full Content:
On Thursday, JPMorgan maintained its Overweight rating and NT$1,200.00 price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (2330:TT) (NYSE:TSM), citing expectations for a robust third-quarter earnings report. The firm anticipates that TSMC's revenue will slightly exceed the upper end of the company's forecast, with projected revenues of US $23.3 billion against guidance of US$22.4-23.2 billion. Gross margins (GMs) are also expected to be at the high end of TSMC's forecast, with an estimate of 54.8% compared to the projected range of 53.5-55.5%. The positive outlook is partly attributed to the strong growth in the N3 technology node, which is used for the latest iPhone builds and new application processors from companies like Mediatek and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Additionally, the N4 node, primarily utilized for AI accelerators, is expected to contribute to the company's revenue growth. JPMorgan forecasts a quarter-over-quarter revenue increase of approximately 10% for the fourth quarter of 2024 due to these factors. JPMorgan also anticipates that TSMC will continue to communicate strong demand trends for its N3 technology and a persistent supply-demand gap for advanced packaging solutions, particularly the Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS) technology. The firm's outlook is bolstered by the expectation that 2025 will be a strong year for TSMC. This optimism is based on the sustained demand for AI accelerators, the expansion of N3 engagements beyond Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and an anticipated uptick in gross margins due to improved yields and potential price increases for the N3E technology node. In other recent news, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) has reported significant growth in its second quarter of 2024, with a sequential revenue increase of 13.6% in NT dollars and 10.3% in USD. The company's gross margin rose to 53.2%, and its operating margin reached 42.5%. TSMC's High-Performance Computing (HPC) segment accounted for more than half of the total revenue for the first time, standing at 52%. The company revised its full-year revenue guidance to a growth rate slightly above the mid-20s percent in USD terms. BofA Securities maintained a positive outlook on TSMC, reiterating a Buy rating. The firm highlighted the upcoming delivery of a high-numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tool to TSMC from ASML (AS:ASML), which is expected to enhance the company's capabilities in developing advanced semiconductor processes. TSMC's August financial report showed a revenue of NT$251 billion, a 2% decrease month-over-month but a 33% increase year-over-year. Bernstein SocGen Group updated its outlook on TSMC, increasing the price target to $220 from the previous $200, and retaining an Outperform rating on the stock. The firm suggests TSMC is well-positioned to perform better than its peers should a recession occur, due to its advanced technologies and market share gains. Finally, TSMC's capital expenditure for 2024 is projected to be between USD 30 billion and USD 32 billion, primarily allocated to advanced process technologies. As Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) approaches its next earnings date on October 17, 2024, the company's financial health and market performance remain a focal point for investors. With a market capitalization of $803.45 billion and a P/E ratio of 27.72, TSMC stands as a significant player in the semiconductor industry. In the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, TSMC has reported a revenue growth of 9.44%, showcasing its ability to expand amidst a dynamic tech landscape. This is further evidenced by a substantial quarterly revenue growth of 40.07% in Q2 2024, highlighting the company's strong performance in the short term. InvestingPro Tips suggest that TSMC's robust gross profit margin of 53.36% aligns with JPMorgan's expectations of high-end gross margins for the company. Additionally, with a dividend growth of 42.6% in the same period, TSMC demonstrates its commitment to returning value to shareholders. It's worth noting that the InvestingPro product lists 15 additional tips that can provide deeper insights into TSM's financial health and investment potential. Investors may also find TSMC's price resilience of interest, with the stock trading at 94.25% of its 52-week high. This, combined with a year-to-date price total return of 76.84%, positions TSMC favorably in the eyes of growth-oriented investors. The company's fair value, as assessed by analysts, stands at $214, while InvestingPro's fair value estimation is at $161.5, offering a perspective on the stock's potential undervaluation or overvaluation.

Title: Dublin woman in Vancouver: Finding work has been hard but Ironman gives me purpose
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/abroad/2024/09/26/life-in-vancouver-and-its-hurdles-for-an-irishwoman-throwing-herself-into-ironman/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
I’m from Blackrock, Dublin, and in March, I left Ireland to travel through Asia and America before landing in Vancouver, Canada, in July. When I decided to move here alone, I knew it would be challenging, but I didn’t fully grasp just how much. The city is beautiful, but the reality of being in a new place, with no job and no familiar faces, hit me hard. The loneliness could have been overwhelming, but I chose a different path – I set goals, achievable ones, that would help me find purpose and direction. Life in Vancouver, however, has its own set of hurdles. The job market here has been slow, and finding work has been tougher than I anticipated. Yet, instead of letting this get me down. I have thrown myself into my training daily. Training gives me purpose when everything else feels uncertain, I’ve learned. It structures my days, filling them with meaning and direction. One of the most ambitious goals I have set for myself is to complete my first full-distance Ironman 140.6 in Tempe Arizona in November (which consists of a 3.9km swim, a 180.2km bicycle race and then a 42.2km run, for a total of 226.3km – or 140.6 miles). Before taking on that challenge, I aimed to complete an official Ironman 70.3 in Penticton, British Columbia, on August 25th. The race was supposed to be a straightforward test of endurance, but the universe had other plans. On the morning of the race, the water temperature unexpectedly dropped to 10 degrees, forcing the organisers to cancel the swim. It was a curveball I didn’t expect, but I pushed forward, completing the bike and run portions and finishing in less than six hours. Obstacles in life are inevitable, but it is how we react to these that matters most. My dream is not just to compete, but to guide others, particularly disabled athletes, through the world of triathlons and Ironman races Crossing that finish line was a mix of frustration and triumph. The swim cancellation was disappointing, but it didn’t overshadow the sense of achievement I felt. This race was a stepping stone, a necessary part of my journey toward the full Ironman. I’m self-coached, driven by a passion that I hope will one day lead me to become a coach myself. My dream is not just to compete, but to guide others, particularly disabled athletes, through the world of triathlons and Ironman races. Each day I lace up my running shoes or hop on my bike, I’m not just working toward my goals, I’m building a foundation for my future. [ Why many Irish people chose Vancouver to go for a holiday or a longer stayOpens in new window ] [ A second life in Vancouver: ‘I made the decision to get away from any potential downward spiral into addiction’Opens in new window ] Without this focus, I think the loneliness would have been unbearable. Every run, every ride, every session, is a step closer to my goals – not just the physical ones, but the personal ones too. When you feel lost, set a goal. When you feel overwhelmed, take the first step. You’ll be amazed at what you can achieve when you give yourself direction. As a young woman navigating life in a new city, it’s crucial to carve out your own path, to find out who you are and what you’re made of. This journey has been about more than just completing races, I realise. It’s been about building resilience, finding inner strength and creating a future that I’m excited about. By the time I crossed the finish line in Penticton, I was physically exhausted but emotionally charged. There was no one waiting for me, no familiar face in the crowd to share the moment with, but I realised that didn’t diminish the victory. I celebrated myself, recognising that this was more than just the end of a race, it was a milestone in my journey of self-discovery and growth. In that moment, I understood that this period of my life, with all its challenges and solitude, was shaping me into someone stronger, more resilient and more self-reliant. [ Irish abroad: The seven stages of moving to a new countryOpens in new window ] The race isn’t just about finishing, it’s about finding out what you’re capable of, and realising that the journey itself is just as important as the destination. So, for anyone feeling lost or uncertain, set your sights on something that excites you, challenges you, and pushes you forward. Take the leap, set the goal and watch yourself grow in ways you never imagined. The road ahead is still long, with many miles left to cover, but I’m ready for it. Each day, I’m becoming more of the person I want to be – stronger, more focused and driven by a passion to not just cross my own finish lines but to help others cross theirs too.

Title: Opportunity knocks for a new group of players on Emerging Ireland tour
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/09/26/opportunity-knocks-for-a-new-group-of-players-on-emerging-ireland-tour/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
The Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa in 2022 will serve as a benchmarking process, directly and indirectly, for the current squad who depart on Saturday for their three-match assignment in the land of the world champions. Simon Easterby, head coach again as he was two years ago, mentioned that half a dozen players from that Emerging Ireland squad went on to make their senior Test debuts. On Wednesday, backs coach Andrew Goodman figured that the aforementioned group had accumulated around 50 caps since then. As an initiative it was an unqualified success despite initial misgivings in some quarters, and the hope is that it will again provide a similar pathway for another tranche of players. Goodman is Ireland’s new backs coach, having moved from Leinster at the end of last season. He shadowed his predecessor Mike Catt during Ireland’s two Test drawn series against the Springboks and now returns to South Africa. The New Zealander is delighted to have a whistle around his neck again. He is relishing the first pitch session at the IRFU High-Performance Centre, where he will get to work with some of his previous charges at Leinster and a selection of the best young players from the other provinces. Goodman said: “We want to build depth and have competition in positions. We want guys to have that opportunity, see them in our structures, see how they play, how they learn. It’s just [discovering] that Irish way of doing things that is different to the way the provinces do things. “A lot of it is around our language, a little bit around how we want to play the game. The provinces are doing an amazing job, all the lads are very well coached. We are just trying to build on that but also add our flavour and what makes us [Ireland] different. “It’s a great opportunity for these boys to come in and experience what [senior] Test weeks are like and how they take on information and put that on to the field. It is important that they take it in from the first day. We can’t have people waiting around and holding back. We need them to come and put their best foot forward straight away.” Goodman said that time spent with his new coaching colleagues in the senior Irish set-up during the summer was invaluable. “In terms of South Africa, it was a great little introduction to see how the Irish set-up works, the language they use and how the week is run. “It was a great experience, and I suppose the energy they all came in with, the way they connected and the level of expectation around the way they do things, that accountability was huge. You could obviously see from the outside that it was a well-connected group. It was just great to see first-hand that energy and connection that they drove. “It was great to get a step ahead coming into the Emerging Ireland tour now and with November later on, so I guess there are differences in the way weeks are run but nothing major.” Goodman will be responsible for the team attack with Emerging Ireland before paring back the role a little in November when head coach Andy Farrell is in charge once again. Goodman said: “I’ll be doing a lot of work with the backs on strikes [moves] from scrum and lineout and on skill work for the team and assisting Andy, obviously, when it comes to November time. He’s not coming on this trip, so [I] get to do a little bit more of the team attack as well, but I’ll be assisting him with those bits of the attack when it comes to November and beyond.” Ireland’s three tour matches against the Pumas, Western Force and the Cheetahs will be broadcast on the IRFU’s new streaming platform IrishRugby+, a sports innovation project with Enterprise Ireland and the Cork-based company, Wiistream. IrishRugby+ will stream selected games free from the men’s and women’s Energia All-Ireland Leagues (AIL) as well as carry additional games such as the upcoming Emerging Ireland tour. IrishRugby+ will also provide links to additional club streams that are made available to them on a weekly basis, in an effort to promote and publicise as many games as possible.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs secure 5-day inflow streak as BlackRock rakes in $184 million

Share this article US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have notched their fifth consecutive day of positive performance, collectively taking in approximately $106 million on Wednesday. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led with around $184 million in net inflows, according to data tracked by Farside Investors. On Wednesday, Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF (BITB) added around $2 million in new capital. In contrast, Fidelity’s Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and ARK Invest/21Shares’s Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) faced outflows of approximately $33 million and $47 million, respectively. Other competing Bitcoin ETFs, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), saw zero flows. Since GBTC was converted into an ETF, investors have withdrawn over $20 billion from the fund. However, massive outflows, which were observed after the conversion, have subsided in recent weeks. As GBTC’s outflow slows down and capital flows to other funds, especially BlackRock’s IBIT, the group of US spot Bitcoin funds has experienced sustained inflows for five consecutive trading days. These ETFs have attracted about $ 246 million in net inflows so far this week. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Watch These Meta Platforms Price Levels as Stock Sets Record High

Time Published: 2024-09-26T02:06:11Z
Full Content:
Meta Platforms (META) shares will likely remain in focus for the remainder of the week after the tech titan’s stock set a record high on Wednesday and the company kicked off its annual Connect conference. The company unveiled a lower-cost Quest 3S headset, Orion augmented reality glasses, new artificial intelligence (AI) features, and other tech gadgets at the highly anticipated event. The Facebook and Instagram parent has also turned to celebrities, announcing deals with actors Awkwafina, John Cena, and Judi Dench, among others, that will allow the company to use their voices in a new AI assistant. Since the start of the year, Meta’s stock has gained around 60% through Wednesday’s close as the social media company's latest quarterly results indicate that significant investments in AI infrastructure and product innovations have started to translate into higher advertising revenue and earnings. Meta shares gained 0.9% on Wednesday to finish at $568.31, after surging to an all-time high of $576.88 during the session. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Meta’s chart and identify important price levels to watch out for. Meta shares broke out from a five-month ascending triangle on above-average volume earlier this month, with the stock price continuing to track higher into its Connect 2024 conference. The stock’s breakout coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) moving into overbought territory to confirm bullish price momentum but also caution of short-term stretched conditions. To forecast potential price targets above the stock’s all-time high (ATH), investors can use the measuring principle and a more subjective bars pattern. Let’s look at each in further detail. To project a price target using the measuring principle, we calculate the distance of the ascending triangle near its widest point and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For instance, we add $165 to $535, which forecasts an upside target in the stock at $700. Speculating an upside target using a bars pattern works by using a prior trending move to forecast a potential future move, assuming price action tends to rhyme. In this case, we extract the stock’s trend higher from December to March and reposition it from this month’s low, which projects a price target of around $790. We selected this prior move because it commenced from an earlier ascending triangle’s lower trendline on Meta’s chart, similar to the stock’s price action from the most recent ascending triangle. Given the RSI indicator points to overbought conditions in the stock, investors should also keep a close eye on the $535 level, an area on the chart where prior resistance could become future support near the ascending triangle's upper trendline. Market participants who prefer to trade pullbacks rather than chase breakouts could look for buying opportunities near this area.

Title: Ethereum ETF impacted by SEC’s delayed decision – Here’s how

Time Published: 2024-09-26T01:30:11Z
Full Content:
Why did the SEC delay its decision on the Ethereum ETF listing? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended its timeline for reviewing Nasdaq’s proposal to list and trade options on BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum [ETH] Trust (ETHA). Initially set for a decision by the 26th of September, the SEC has now postponed its ruling until the 10th of November. In a statement released on the 24th of September, the agency explained that the delay would provide additional time to evaluate the potential impact of this listing on market stability and ensure a thorough review of its implications for the broader financial landscape. The press release added, “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change.” Under Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, the SEC has the authority to delay its decision on proposals for up to 90 days. This extension provides the regulator with additional time to thoroughly assess potential market risks and stability before making a final ruling. By doing so, the SEC ensures a comprehensive review of any implications the decision may have on the broader financial landscape. In a separate development, the U.S. SEC has also deferred its decision on NYSE American’s proposal to list and trade options for Bitwise’s spot Ethereum ETFs, including the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. The deadline for this decision has been pushed to 11th November. In a seemingly contrasting move, the SEC recently approved Nasdaq’s request to list and trade options for BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF. On the 20th of September, the SEC officially greenlit options trading for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, which will trade under the ticker symbol IBIT. According to Nasdaq, these options will be available for trading under the same conditions and regulations as other ETF options, further expanding the investment opportunities surrounding Bitcoin. That being said, Ethereum ETFs have experienced a significant outflow since their launch, with a cumulative outflow of $624.4 million, largely driven by Grayscale’s Ether ETF (ETHE). The outflows have been particularly notable in recent weeks, with the 23rd of September marking the largest net outflow since July, as $79 million was withdrawn. Grayscale’s ETHE led this decline, seeing a staggering $80.6 million outflow in a single day, the largest since spot Ether ETFs debuted earlier this year. Despite occasional inflows, the overall trend remains one of heavy withdrawals from these funds.

September 25, 2024 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD), DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC), and Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV) Class Period: February 22, 2024 - July 8, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants (1) grossly overstated their ability to forecast the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior products, which forecasting ability was far less capable and effective than Defendants had led investors and analysts to believe; (2) overstated the financial prospects of SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE, and thus overstated the Company's anticipated revenue and other financial metrics; (3) knew or recklessly disregarded that because of the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior's products, Indivior was unlikely to meet its own previously issued and repeatedly reaffirmed FY 2024 net revenue guidance, including its FY 2024 net revenue guidance for SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE; (4) knew or recklessly disregarded that Indivior was at a significant risk of, and/or was likely to, cease all sales and marketing activities related to PERSERIS; and (5) knew or recklessly disregarded that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Indivior class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/INDV CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) Class Period: November 29, 2023 - July 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit. For more information on the CrowdStrike class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CRWD DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) Class Period: May 26, 2021 - May 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants misrepresented its ongoing “transformation journey” and the Company’s ability to integrate previously acquired companies and business systems. While touting its ongoing success in implementing that integration, DXC repeatedly stressed its commitment to reducing the Company’s restructuring and transaction, separation, and integration (“TSI”) costs in order to increase its free cashflow and “unleash [its] true earnings power.” In truth, Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the Company was only able to reduce its restructuring and TSI costs by limiting its integration efforts. The complaint alleges that on August 3, 2022, DXC reported disappointing first quarter results, despite having reiterated its guidance just six weeks prior. DXC blamed its poor performance on the fact that its “cost optimization efforts have moved at a slower pace than anticipated.” These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline by 17%, from $31.52 per share to $26.15 per share. Then, on May 16, 2024, DXC’s CEO admitted that “the previous restructurings did not set a real, clean, solid, fully integrated baseline for profitable growth” because the systems that were acquired over time were “never integrated, never deduped,” and admitted that the Company was “not [a] fully functional organization.” DXC also announced it would need to spend an additional $250 million to achieve the restructuring and integration process it falsely claimed to have been successfully implementing during the Class Period. These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline nearly 17%, from $19.88 per share to $16.52 per share. For more information on the DXC class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DXC Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE) Class Period: December 1, 2022 - July 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided investors with false and/or materially misleading information about Five Below’s financial strength and operations, including its outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024. This information included Five Below’s statement that net sales are expected to be in the range of $826 million to $846 million based on opening approximately 55 to 60 new stores in the first quarter. Further, Five Below claimed that net sales for the full year are expected to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $4.07 billion based on opening between 225 and 235 new stores. Investors discovered that these statements were false and/or materially misleading when, on June 5, 2024, Five Below announced disappointing first quarter 2024 sales result and cut its full year 2024 guidance stating, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $3.79 billion to $3.87 billion based on opening approximately 230 new stores.” At the same time, Five Below claimed that for the second quarter, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $830 million to $850 million based on opening approximately 60 new stores.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (“CrowdStrike” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: CRWD) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2024 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the Company’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. Beginning on July 19, 2024, investors learned about critical issues with CrowdStrike’s technology when a single update pushed by CrowdStrike caused outages for millions of users of Microsoft Windows devices worldwide, including financial institutions, government entities, and corporations. Further, CrowdStrike disclosed that the outages had left users vulnerable to potential hacking threats. On this news, shares of CrowdStrike fell $38.09 or 11% to close at $304.96 on July 19, 2024. Then, on July 22, 2024, the fallout of the outages was further revealed as Congress called on Defendant Kurtz to testify regarding the crisis and the Company’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, shares of CrowdStrike fell $41.05 or 13.5% to close at $263.91 on July 22, 2024. Investors continued to learn about the legal risk Defendants had concealed on July 29,2024, as news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from the Company following the outages. On this news, shares of CrowdStrike fell $25.16 or 10% to close at $233.65 on July 30, 2024. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding CrowdStrike’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Chief Product Officer, Christopher K. Cox, has recently sold a portion of his holdings in the company. The transaction, which took place on September 23, involved the sale of 10,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $569.93 per share, amounting to a total of over $5.6 million. This sale was conducted under a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows company insiders to sell shares at a predetermined time to avoid accusations of trading on nonpublic information. The shares sold by Cox were held by the Christopher K. Cox Revocable Trust, for which he is the trustee. Following the sale, Cox's trust still retains a significant stake in the company, with 328,662 shares of Meta Platforms' Class A common stock remaining. Additionally, Cox is associated with the Cox-Vadakan Irrevocable Remainder Trust, which holds 55,046 shares. Investors often monitor insider sales as they may provide insights into executives' views on the company's current valuation and future prospects. However, it is important to note that such transactions do not necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the company; they may be part of personal financial planning or diversification strategies. Meta Platforms, Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc ., is a leader in the technology sector, specifically within the computer programming and data processing industry.

Though a flood of capital into new spot Bitcoin ETFs pushed the price of BTC to a new all-time high in March, just two months after ETFs were approved in the U.S., the price should be much higher today with all those billions flowing into the market, befuddled Bitcoin buyers say. Coinbase—the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange that serves as custodian for most Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock—must not actually be buying the Bitcoin requested by these funds, and instead merely issuing “IOUs,” or “paper” Bitcoin, these critics say. The unsubstantiated rumors echoed throughout social media over the last few months, and eventually became loud enough that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong addressed the concerns on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Not sure what this is all about [to be honest],” he said last week. “All ETF mints and burns we process are ultimately settled on-chain.” Just two days later, however, BlackRock filed an amendment to its ETF registration with the SEC which now requires Coinbase to release Bitcoin much quicker to the asset manager, within 12 hours of notice, when BlackRock customers buy shares of its Bitcoin ETF product. Critics latched onto the update as evidence that their worries were not unfounded. Baldilocks here. Not sure what this is all about TBH. All ETF mints and burns we process are ultimately settled onchain. Institutional clients have trade financing and OTC options before trades are settled onchain. This is the norm for all our institutional clients. All funds… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 14, 2024 But it’s all hogwash, says Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. “I’ve been tracking [the ETF] industry for 20 years, and there’s never been a case of this stuff not being with the custodian,” he told Decrypt. “First of all, it’d be illegal.” The idea that an ETF issuer or its custodian may not actually hold the underlying asset isn’t new. As Balchunas pointed out on X, it’s a worry that some gold investors have shared about gold ETFs for years. pic.twitter.com/u6lupDrOgs — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 16, 2024 An ETF is a way for investors to gain exposure to an asset, like gold or Bitcoin, without actually holding the asset themselves. With Bitcoin ETFs, for example, investors buy shares in BlackRock’s fund, and BlackRock then buys a corresponding amount of Bitcoin and stores it on Coinbase. There are trade-offs, though, and the added convenience requires an element of trust—and risk. Skeptical Bitcoiners would rather see on-chain receipts than receive assurances. The idea that Coinbase may be issuing paper Bitcoin to BlackRock dates back to at least May, when the pseudonymous trader “Tyler Durden,” who holds a sizable audience on X, began the charge. “Blackrock can take as much Bitcoin as they want from Coinbase and the transaction is recorded off chain,” he tweeted. The post currently has 1.6 million views. Earlier this month, music producer and crypto trader MartyParty fanned the flames, claiming that the price of Bitcoin is not moving upwards despite BlackRock “buying all the Bitcoin.” “Scam of the century,” he wrote. Balchunas dismissed the claims as a “conspiracy theory.” “This isn’t like FTX, where you just throw up an exchange out of nowhere, and some buffoon is running it from a Bahama penthouse,” he told Decrypt. “[BlackRock] is a serious company which has dozens of lawyers. They’re not gonna jeopardize their hard won reputation, let alone get sued by all the investors,” he said. Balchunas yesterday confirmed on X that he had spoken with BlackRock to find out more. He said that the asset manager runs “its own blockchain node” and pulls the BTC balances from their wallet addresses to put on Coinbase Prime every night. He said the firm can show balances to clients if requested, but would never make them public as they could get hit with spam such as dusting (when crypto users send small quantities of Bitcoin to wallet addresses to track, taint, or de-anonymize them.) BlackRock declined to respond to Decrypt’s questions, instead pointing to an interview Robbie Mitchnick, the firm’s head of digital assets, gave Bloomberg on Tuesday. When asked about last week’s controversial filing regarding Coinbase, he said it was a “normal course update” and that “nothing of significance has changed.” A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed to Decrypt that the unsubstantiated rumors being pushed on X were just that and nothing more, adding that regulatory updates were normal. No conspiracies. Nothing of significance has changed. This is a normal course update. https://t.co/kAk0NQI1yV — Jaclyn Sales 🛡️ (@MsJaclynSales) September 25, 2024 BlackRock’s IBIT is the biggest and most successful of the ETFs now trading in the U.S. The fund currently holds 357,732 BTC, according to its website, worth around $22.6 billion.

Micron Technology (MU) shares surged in extended trading Wednesday as the company's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit of $887 million or 79 cents per share in the fiscal fourth quarter, from a loss of $1.43 billion or $1.31 per share a year ago. Revenue nearly doubled to $7.75 billion, topping analysts' estimates. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the revenue gains were driven by “robust AI demand," and that the company is moving into fiscal 2025 “with the best competitive positioning in Micron's history." Micron said it expects current-quarter revenue to reach a record high between $8.5 billion to $8.9 billion, with the low end of that range above the analyst consensus. The company's projection for diluted earnings per share (EPS) of between $1.46 and $1.62 also exceeded estimates. Shares of Micron jumped more than 13% to $108.34 in extended trading Wednesday following the release.

Title: XRP Price Explosion Finally In The Cards as Grayscale XRP Trust Turns Game-Changer For XRP-Based ETF
URL: https://zycrypto.com/xrp-price-explosion-finally-in-the-cards-as-grayscale-xrp-trust-turns-game-changer-for-xrp-based-etf/

Ripple’s XRP is on a massive uptrend, gaining 7.7% in the seven days. The gains come after the world’s largest digital asset manager, Grayscale, announced plans to launch the first XRP Trust in the US. According to Grayscale, the launch of the XRP Trust is the first step towards the digital asset manager launching an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for XRP. “We believe Grayscale XRP Trust provides investors with exposure to a blockchain solution that is potentially positioned to play a crucial role in optimizing legacy financial systems by streamlining cross-border payments,” said the head of product and research at Grayscale, Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary. The product will operate as a “closed-end” fund that will expose investors to XRP. The firm noted that the trust will be rolled out gradually in four phases, and an ETF is planned for later. Grayscale is the main force behind the approval of spot crypto ETFs in the US. Last year, the asset manager sued the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to a spot ETF tracking BTC’s spot price. After Grayscale won the court case, Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity launched their crypto ETFs. Grayscale’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are also among the largest in the US. The launch of this product also comes amid uncertainty over whether the SEC might appeal a judge’s ruling that XRP secondary sales are not securities. As ZyCrypto reported, the Ripple legal team sought court approval to delay payment for the $125M settlement. The Grayscale XRP Trust will join the growing list of crypto funds managed by Grayscale. The crypto asset manager also offers trusts for other altcoins, including Avalanche and Solana. XRP price jumped by more than 8% after the development to trade at $0.58. Trading volumes also shot up by as high as 80% per CoinMarketCap. The news saw XRP reach the highest level since late August, outperforming the rest of the top ten largest cryptos by market capitalization. According to an analyst on X, XRP has formed a bullish ascending triangle, with a breakout possibly taking the prices to levels above $0.70. This could pave the way for a rally to $1, especially if the trust attracts institutional investors.

Title: Vistra Stock Powers Higher as Analysts Lift Price Targets

Shares of Texas-based power generator Vistra (VST) surged nearly 6% higher on Wednesday, the largest daily gain of any S&P 500 stock. Vistra is no stranger to market-leading upticks, having surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the top-performing stock in the benchmark index this year. Despite the run-up in Vistra's stock price in 2024, several investment firms suggested there could be more upside potential for shares of the utility company. In research notes published this week, Jefferies boosted its price target on Vistra shares to $137 from $99, while Morgan Stanley lifted its target on the stock to $132 from $110. Analysts described catalysts that could help Vistra stock extend its march higher. Jefferies pointed to the firm's acquisition last week of the remaining 15% noncontrolling interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary, which includes nuclear generation facilities as well other renewable and energy-storage assets. Analysts equated the Vision deal to buying back shares at a discount. The report from Jefferies also focused on the recent announcement from fellow electricity generator Constellation Energy (CEG) that it will restart a shuttered nuclear plant to provide power to Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. The analyst team believes the deal "confirms and expands" their thesis that Vistra stands to benefit from data-center opportunities, while the terms of the 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) between Constellation and the software giant set a precedent for lucrative agreements in the future. So far in 2024, Vistra shares have more than tripled in value.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on Wednesday as the upbeat mood that followed last week's interest-rate cut showed signs of dissipating. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% on the day, receding from the all-time closing high posted in the previous session. The Dow fell 0.7%, failing to extend its streak of four consecutive record closes. The Nasdaq eked out a minimal daily gain of less than 0.1%. Shares of the financial technology company Global Payments (GPN) plunged 6.5%, posting the widest loss of any stock in the S&P 500 for the second straight day. The payment solutions provider issued underwhelming profit guidance at an investor conference earlier this week, noting it expects a year of transition in fiscal 2025. Analysts at the financial firm BTIG downgraded Global Payment stock to neutral, citing a lack of visibility in the company's growth trajectory that they believe leaves the stock in "no man's land" over the coming quarters. Amgen (AMGN) shares lost 5.5% after the drugmaker released data from a Phase 3 clinical trial of an experimental eczema treatment. Although Amgen's drug met its primary endpoint in the study, analysts question whether the results were strong enough for the treatment to merit a strong share in a market already served by Dupixent, a medication jointly developed by Amgen rivals Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron (REGN). Shares of major U.S. automakers moved lower following unfavorable comments from analysts at Morgan Stanley. The investment firm downgraded General Motors (GM) to "underweight" from "equal weight" and scaled back its view on Ford Motor (F) to "equal weight" from "overweight," citing increased competition in China and a challenging environment for U.S. consumers. GM shares were down 4.9% on Wednesday, while Ford shares slid 4.1%. Vistra (VST) shares soared 5.9%, securing the S&P 500's top daily performance after Jefferies and Morgan Stanley boosted their price target on the utility stock. Analysts reacted positively to Vistra's recent acquisition of the remaining stake in its Vistra Vision subsidiary. In addition, the analysts said they believe the recent deal by fellow electricity generator Constellation Energy (CEG) to power Microsoft (MSFT) data centers sets a positive precedent for other attractive agreements. Constellation Energy shares were up 3.7% on the day. Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) jumped 5.1% as Barclays upgraded the stock to "overweight" and lifted its price target. Analysts pointed to signs of recovery in the enterprise hardware business and said they view HPE stock as one of the best ways to invest in this trend. Barclays also believes HPE can continue to increase sales of its artificial intelligence (AI) servers, make gains in the storage market, and benefit from its acquisition of Juniper Networks (JNPR) announced at the beginning of the year. Intel (INTC) shares added 3.2%, extending strong gains posted this week amid reports of a potential investment of up to $5 billion from asset management firm Apollo Global Management. Intel has also reportedly drawn interest from fellow chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM). In addition, Intel launched two new AI products on Tuesday that are central to its strategy of improving its position in the data center market.

Costco Wholesale (COST) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts projecting growth on the top and bottom lines—but very little further appreciation for the shares. The membership-based bulk retailer has seen its stock climb about 40% this year. Of the 19 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 13 have a buy rating on Costco's stock. The consensus price target of $912.94 represents only a slim premium to Wednesday's close of $908.42. Costco is projected to report $2.27 billion in net income on just shy of $79.96 billion in revenue, up from $2.2 billion and $78.9 billion, respectively, a year earlier. Investors will be watching closely for the company’s first results since raising its membership price for the first time in seven years. Here’s what you need to know about Costco’s upcoming earnings report.

A pump failed in the reactor cooling system, shutting down the plant and threatening a nuclear meltdown. (Photo by Owen Franken/Corbis via Getty Images) Nvidia stock has soared 156% in 2024. Meanwhile, shares of Constellation Energy — a provider of nuclear power services and owner of the Three Mile Island facility in Pennsylvania that suffered an accident in March 1979 — have risen 129%. Constellation — which recently signed a 10-year agreement for Microsoft to pay the nuclear energy leader about $16 billion, according to Seeking Alpha — could be a better investment than Nvidia. Here are three reasons: One downside to consider is that analysts’ price targets fully capture Constellation’s upside, according to TipRanks. The demand for energy to operate data centers is forecast to rise as Nvidia revenue growth slows. U.S. power demand has remained roughly unchanged between 2014 and 2024, noted TheStreet. However overall power demand in data centers is projected to surge “160% by 2030,” according to a May 2024 Goldman Sachs report. To be sure, demand for AI-related hardware and software is also forecast to grow rapidly. More specifically, Bain estimates the total addressable market will increase by 40% to 55% annually, ranging between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027, according to Barron’s. While Nvidia expects to grow faster than the industry, the AI chip designer’s revenue growth is slowing down. Nvidia’s revenues grew in a range of 206% to 265%, between the second quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, according to Investor’s Business Daily. Nvidia is still growing rapidly — but at a lower rate. For instance, the AI chip designer’s revenue increased 122% in the second quarter of 2024 and the company forecasts 80% growth in the third quarter of 2024, I noted in a September post on Forbes. Constellation Energy operates the largest U.S. fleet of nuclear power plants, which is the preferred electricity-generating fuel for tech companies, according to Seeking Alpha. In February 2022, Constellation was spun off from utility company, Exelon. Constellation stock surged 22% on September 20 following the announcement of a 20-year deal with Microsoft to supply electricity from a $1.6 billion restart of the undamaged 835-megawatt nuclear Unit 1 of Three Mile Island — which “closed under economic pressure” in 2019, noted the Wall Street Journal. The facility’s Unit 2 was shut down in 1979 after a partial core meltdown. The resulting five days of panic “heightened awareness of nuclear plants’ potential safety problems and contributed to a loss of enthusiasm for the industry that lasted decades,” the Journal reported. The company’s latest financial report for the June 2024-ending quarter fell short of earnings and revenue expectations. However, Constellation Energy raised its earnings per share forecast for 2024. Specifically, the company’s EPS of $1.68 was four cents below the consensus estimate while the company’s $5.48 billion in revenue fell $70 million short of analysts’ consensus forecast, noted TheStreet. Constellation raised its adjusted EPS outlook for fiscal 2024 by 4.8% to $8 a share at the midpoint of the range — 19 cents more than the consensus, TheStreet reported. Might this boost in Constellation’s earnings growth target foreshadow expectations-beating revenue growth? Analysts lifted the company’s stock price target significantly in the wake of the company’s deal with Microsoft. Examples include: Other analysts were bullish on Constellation. While Guggenheim's Shahriar Pourreza added “the hyperscaler demand for clean megawatts is real,” Mizuho's Maheep Mandloi indicated the arrangement “points to the need for 24×7 clean energy to meet data center needs,” MarketWatch noted. To be sure, anti-nuclear sentiment — while negative at times — is arguably less pronounced than in the past. With state and federal governments urging utilities to use nuclear and renewables fuel to make electricity, Constellation has more support than before. Moreover, since it requires “neither expensive battery storage nor quick-on extra natural gas capacity equal to 110% of renewable capacity,” nuclear has advantages over renewables, reported TheStreet. It appears Wall Street still sees more upside to Nvidia stock. The 42 analysts covering the AI chip designer set an average price target of $152 — representing 24% upside, according to TipRanks, which notes Constellation’s average price target of $214 from 20 analysts makes the stock about 1% overvalued.

The Bitcoin creator is estimated to have 1.1 million BTC, 17% more than the Bitcoin ETFs' combined stash of 916,047 BTC stash as of Sept. 24. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have amassed more than 900,000 BTC since their launch and will soon surpass the 1.1 million BTC held in wallets believed to be owned by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently shared a list of spot Bitcoin ETF holdings, highlighting their cumulative 916,047 BTC stash as of Sept. 24. He noted that the ETFs are close to surpassing the 1 million BTC threshold cumulatively and just 17% shy of surpassing Nakamoto’s estimated stash. At the current price of $63,622.03, reaching 1 million BTC equates to over $63.6 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) holds the largest amount among the US-traded funds, with 358,080 BTC, while Grayscale’s ETFs, GBTC and Grayscale Mini Trust (BTC), collectively hold 258,671 BTC. Rounding out the top 3 is Fidelity’s ETF FBTC, which holds 184,490 BTC. Together, these three Bitcoin ETFs represent nearly 86% of the BTC held by 11 US-traded ETFs. Shaun Edmondson, author of the list shared by Balchunas, noted that Fidelity holds roughly 100,000 BTC as a custodian for MicroStrategy. However, those were not included in the report. Notably, BlackRock added nearly 530 BTC to its wallets over the past 24 hours, according to on-chain data. The last time the asset manager bought Bitcoin was one week ago, through a 273 BTC transfer from Coinbase Prime vaults. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) reached $17.8 billion in total flows on Sept. 24, as per Farside Investors’ data. This new mark was reached after four consecutive days of inflows, which totaled roughly $391 million. Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge by registering $117.7 million in positive flows. BlackRock’s IBIT followed closely with $110.4 million in inflows, despite not registering activity in two out of the four last trading days. The significant amount is then due to nearly $99 million in cash flowing to IBIT yesterday. ARK 21Shares’ ARKB wrapped up the list of Bitcoin ETFs with over $100 million in inflows, showing $103.1 million in positive net flows in four trading days.

Title: Congress Slams CrowdStrike (CRWD) for July Failure - Hagens Berman

September 25, 2024 15:02 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike faced intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill on September 24 as lawmakers demanded answers for a catastrophic software update that crippled essential services across the nation. Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-Tenn.) castigated the company's CEO, George Kurtz, for evading direct testimony and dispatching a subordinate to address the crisis. “This was a systemic failure with far-reaching consequences,” Green declared, “and we cannot let it happen again.” Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s senior vice president, offered a mea culpa for the incident, attributing the widespread outage to a faulty configuration update that caused a "Blue Screen of Death" on millions of Windows devices. However, his apology fell short of assuaging lawmakers' concerns. Congress’ interrogation of CrowdStrike comes on the heels of a September 12 report by SEMAFOR, wherein former CrowdStrike employees painted a picture of a company culture that prioritized speed over quality. Multiple sources described a workplace where mistakes were commonplace, and workers were often undertrained. One former manager even recalled warnings about the potential for catastrophic failures if the company continued to release untested products Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): The outage has also sparked litigation against CrowdStrike, with plaintiffs alleging that the company misled investors about the reliability of its flagship Falcon Sensor product. The complaint accuses CrowdStrike of failing to disclose significant risks associated with its update process and of downplaying the potential consequences of a major outage. The truth began to emerge on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down nearly 16% since the outage.

Mark Zuckerberg is trying once again to bring VR to the masses, this time through a new Quest 3S headset that arrives next month starting at $299. The device promises to offer the same high-quality VR experience found in last year’s pricier Quest 3, for $200 less. “We’ve been working on bringing the Quest 3 family to a lot more people,” Zuckerberg said at the Meta Connect conference on Wednesday. The resulting Quest 3S looks similar, but Meta is indicating it reduced the product’s cost by changing the lens inside the headset. The new headset uses a “fresnel lens” with a lower resolution of 1,832 by 1,920 or 773 pixels per inch. The Quest 3, on the other hand, features “pancake lenses,” which can offer a higher resolution at 2,064 by 2,208 or 1218ppi. In addition, the 3S has a lower field of view at 96 degrees versus 110 degrees, according to the company’s comparison page. The other noticeable change is the exterior cameras, which are positioned differently, although both VR headsets offer full color passthrough, enabling you to view your real-world surroundings while wearing the device. The passthrough is the key to both the Quest 3 and 3S offering a "mixed reality" experience, meaning you can overlay virtual icons and windows on real-world sights. This will eventually include running the Windows OS remotely though the headset, according to Zuckerberg. On the plus side, the 3S can run a little longer, at 2.5 hours per battery charge, despite having a slightly smaller battery. Both headsets also use the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 processor and contain 8GB of RAM, which is perhaps why Zuckerberg said the 3S offers the same “defining features” as the Quest 3, including hand-tracking. The company is marketing the Quest 3S for people new to mixed reality experiences, or “who might have been waiting for a low-cost upgrade.” Preorders for Quest 3S start today with the company charging $299 for the 128GB model and $399 for the 256GB model. The product is then slated to start shipping on Oct. 15. Stay tuned for our review. Meta is also cutting the price of the 512GB Quest 3 from $649.99 to $499. The 128GB version of the Quest 3, which also goes for $499, is out of stock.

The device promises to offer the same high-quality VR experience found in last year’s pricier Quest 3, for $200 less. “We’ve been working on bringing the Quest 3 family to a lot more people,” Zuckerberg said at the Meta Connect conference on Wednesday. The resulting Quest 3S looks similar, but Meta is indicating it reduced the product’s cost by changing the lens inside the headset. The new headset uses a “fresnel lens” with a lower resolution of 1,832 by 1,920 or 773 pixels per inch. The Quest 3, on the other hand, features “pancake lenses,” which can offer a higher resolution at 2,064 by 2,208 or 1218ppi. In addition, the 3S has a lower field of view at 96 degrees versus 110 degrees, according to the company’s comparison page. The other noticeable change is the exterior cameras, which are positioned differently, although both VR headsets offer full color passthrough, enabling you to view your real-world surroundings while wearing the device. The passthrough is the key to both the Quest 3 and 3S offering a "mixed reality" experience, meaning you can overlay virtual icons and windows on real-world sights. This will eventually include running the Windows OS remotely though the headset, according to Zuckerberg. On the plus side, the 3S can run a little longer, at 2.5 hours per battery charge, despite having a slightly smaller battery. Both headsets also use the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 processor and contain 8GB of RAM, which is perhaps why Zuckerberg said the 3S offers the same “defining features” as the Quest 3, including hand-tracking. The company is marketing the Quest 3S for people new to mixed reality experiences, or “who might have been waiting for a low-cost upgrade.” Preorders for Quest 3S start today with the company charging $299 for the 128GB model and $399 for the 256GB model. The product is then slated to start shipping on Oct. 15. Stay tuned for our review. Meta is also cutting the price of the 512GB Quest 3 from $649.99 to $499. The 128GB version of the Quest 3, which also goes for $499, is out of stock.

September 25, 2024 14:22 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Meta will stop selling the Quest 2 and Quest Pro by the end of the year

Meta just revealed the budget-friendly Quest 3S VR headset at its annual Connect keynote event, but it also made a sad announcement about some of its previous headsets. The company will stop selling both the Quest 2 and the Quest Pro by the end of the year. “With Quest 3S on the shelf, we’re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We’ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first,” the company wrote in a blog post that also announced the pending launch of the Quest 3S. The company will be selling Quest 2 and Pro accessories for “a bit longer” after the stock of headsets runs out. This includes the carrying case, the Touch Pro controllers and bundles like the Quest 2 Active Pack. Meta recently lowered the price of the Quest 2 to $200, and it’s still a decent headset for beginners. The Quest 3S is better in every way, but it starts at $300, while the standard Quest 3 costs $500. It’s the end of an era for the Quest 2. This was a hugely successful headset, as it launched during the dog days of COVID-19. For many, it became a crucial item to survive endless isolation, along with stuff like Zoom and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It’s the end of an error (see what I did there?) for the Quest Pro. This headset never caught on, likely because it was originally priced at $1,500 before being quickly lowered to $1,000. It still costs a grand from Meta, but can typically be found for around $900 via Amazon and other retailers. As they say, out with the old and in with the new. The Quest 3S is, essentially, the new Quest 2. It starts at $300, boasts the same CPU as the original Quest 3 and handles full-color passthrough.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The Meta Quest 3S is Meta's new budget-friendly standalone VR headset, and you can preorder now ahead of its October 15 release. By Steven Petite on September 26, 2024 at 3:57PM PDT Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $300 Meta Quest 3S (256GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $400 Meta Quest 3 (512GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $500 The newly announced Meta Quest 3S has a pretty awesome launch bundle that makes the already budget-friendly headset more enticing. From now until April 30, 2025, while supplies last, the Quest 3S will come bundled with Batman: Arkham Shadow, a Quest 3-exclusive action game that pits the Caped Crusader against the Rat King. The Meta Quest 3S launch bundle is available in both storage configurations: 128GB for $300 and 256GB for $400. Preorders are live now at multiple major retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, ahead of the headset's October 15 release date. Announced during Meta Connect 2024, the Quest 3S has the same chipset as the standard Quest 3, the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2, and the same amount of RAM (8GB). Just like with the Quest 3, you'll get a pair of Touch Pro controllers that support gesture controls to navigate menus. Battery life, according to Meta, is slightly better with the Quest 3S, with an average playtime between charges of two-and-a-half hours instead of two hours with the regular Quest 3. Where it cuts costs is with the lenses. The Quest 3S is fitted with the 1832 x 1920 fresnel lenses found in the Meta Quest 2, whereas the pricier Meta Quest 3 has 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses for improved resolution and clarity. In addition to the lower-resolution lenses, the Quest 3S drops the depth sensor and has a narrower field of vision. Meta also significantly reduced the price of the regular 512GB Quest 3, which is eligible for the same bundle offer, and discontinued the 128GB Quest 3 (now on clearance for $430). Meta Quest 3 VR headset options: Check out the new Meta Quest 3S bundles below: The base model 128GB Meta Quest 3S costs $300, the same price as the now-discontinued Meta Quest 2. Not only are you getting a more advanced piece of tech for the same price, Meta is throwing in one of the most exciting upcoming Meta Quest 3 and 3S exclusives, Batman: Arkham Shadow. The new Batman game releases October 22, one week after the Quest 3S arrives. The limited-time Meta Quest 3S bundle also comes with three months of Meta Quest+, a subscription program that normally costs $8 per month. With Quest+, you get two free games each month (valued up to $50). Even if you cancel your subscription, you get to keep those freebies. If you're new to the Meta Quest ecosystem, you're essentially getting seven free games with the purchase of the Quest 3S. Since the Quest 3S launches in October, you'll get two free games each month through the end of the year. Amazon also has a bundle that includes the Elite Strap, one of the most popular first-party accessories for Meta Quest headsets. The Elite Strap replaces the default band and is designed to provide better weight distribution to minimize pressure on your face. The strap is fitted with a dial that allows you to make quick adjustments. You can preorder the Meta Quest 3S bundle with the Elite Strap for $365.73 at Amazon. If Amazon drops the price bundle prior to launch, you'll pay the lowest price offered when your preorder is shipped. If you're unsure about the Elite Strap, you can buy it separately later on. At the moment, buying the headset and Elite Strap separately costs the same price as the bundle at Amazon. The 256GB Meta Quest 3S is available to preorder for $400 at Amazon. Like the 128GB version, you'll get Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta+. Amazon has the Quest 3S 256GB bundle with the Elite Strap included for $465.73. If you want to play Batman: Arkham Shadow but would rather opt for the more powerful Meta Quest 3, the same bundle is available to purchase now at Amazon. The Meta Quest 3 Batman: Arkham Shadow bundle costs $500, which sounds like quite the deal considering the price of the 512GB Quest 3 up until now. Meta revealed the bundle alongside a price drop for the Quest 3. The 512GB model previously cost $650 and will now go for $500. The 128GB model is being discontinued, but remaining stock will be sold for $430 (was $500). As a result of its discontinuation, the 128GB Quest 3 will not be available in the new Batman bundle, but you can buy the headset now for $429 at Walmart.

Title: I tried out Meta's Orion computer glasses. I'd buy them in a heartbeat — if they were actually for sale.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/orion-meta-ar-smart-glasses-review-2024-9
Time Published: 2024-09-25T17:50:17Z

Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology Here is what you need to know about Orion, the new computer-on-your-face nerd glasses Mark Zuckerberg showed off today: Each pair of glasses reportedly costs Meta $10,000 to make, and the company says it needs time to get them to a price that makes them plausible — think something in the $1,000-ish range, like a laptop or high-end phone. (That $10,000 number comes from The Verge's Alex Heath. Meta declined to comment on the number). If all goes well, it could take a few years for that to happen. 2. I've tried them, and they are very cool! They don't make you look cool — you look like someone wearing tech on your face — but the ideas and engineering behind them are really fascinating. If you're one of the people who complains that Silicon Valley hasn't made anything except soul-sucking social networks and monetization machines for years, here's a compelling counter. More important: Unlike other face-computing tech I've tried over the years — Google's Glass, Apple's Vision Pro, Meta's own line of Quest goggles — this is one I can actually imagine buying, and using, in real life. My brief experience with Orion comes with major caveats. The biggest is that it's not actually ready for mass production. But if this pans out, it will deliver what lots of people in tech, and outside tech, say they want: a wearable computer jammed into a pair of glasses. What would you do with a wearable computer? For starters, lots of things you can do with a phone: Take and make phone calls and video calls. Send and receive texts. Take photos and videos. Watch videos. Play time-wasting games. Play around with AI. And because Orion sits on your face like glasses — bulky glasses that use silicon carbide instead of glass — you can do all those things while looking at, and interacting with, everything and everyone around you. This is "augmented reality" — digital images laid over the real world. As opposed to "virtual reality" — where you are totally enveloped by a digital landscape. There are obvious downsides to this. If you think it's frustrating to talk to someone who keeps looking at their phone to check a text or a viral video, imagine what it will be like to hold a conversation with someone who's staring at you and staring at something else at the very same time.* But there are very intriguing upsides, too. Most obviously: Picture yourself with a task — like changing a tire, making marinara, or solving a math problem — and the ability to simultaneously look at the thing you want to do and instructions on how to do it. Orion uses eye tracking, which means you select digital items just by looking at them. And you manipulate them — turn an app on or off, respond to a text message, swipe through videos on Reels — by making subtle flicks and clicks with your fingers. Those gestures get registered by a snug-but-not-bulky wristband** that registers your muscles' movements using electromyography*** and transmits them wirelessly to your glasses. Orion also comes the closest I've seen to a face computer you could take for a stroll. Unlike other devices I've seen, it doesn't need to be plugged into a bulky power source or tethered to a phone. Instead, it connects wirelessly to a TV-remote-sized power/computing device you can slip into your pocket that connects to the internet via WiFi or cell signals. Meta says its battery will last for two to three hours of continual use. And here, I'm going to stop talking about Orion's specs. Because it seems pretty silly to get very deep into a thing that's still in development and may never actually materialize for mass production. It's also important to stress that my brief demo time was in a Meta building, surrounded by Meta employees who guided me through a Meta-scripted walk-through. I have no idea how, or if, this thing works in the real world. Neither do Meta executives, really. They say they're about to start "dogfooding" the device with lots of employees to get a better sense of how it performs while continuing to figure out how to make it lighter and cheaper. Which brings us to two questions about Zuckerberg's reveal this week. First: Why is Meta showing off something no one's going to be able to buy — at best — for years? This reminds me of pre-iPhone reveals, where it was common for tech companies to show you stuff they might make one day, but very often didn't. When I ask Meta executives that question, they murmur about wanting their fellow employees to see the work they're doing, and to be encouraged by the progress they're making. But surely there are other ways to pump up morale — like having a record-high stock price, which happens to have happened this week. My theory relates to that stock price: that Zuckerberg, who has gotten grief over the years for plowing billions into his metaverse dreams, wants to show the world — and specifically investors — that all those dollars weren't wasted. And that he's getting very close to a consumer device people might buy in very large numbers. Which brings us to my second question: Why does Meta, whose online ad business is one of the world's greatest money-printing machines, want to make hardware anyway? That one is easier to answer. Most practically: As great as that money-printing machine is, it can't work without phones made by Apple and Google — companies that force Meta to play by their rules and restrictions. If Orion, or any other device Meta makes, becomes the future of computing, then Zuckerberg can operate his business on his devices. But if you're into vibes-based answers: Orion's debut is part of the Mark Zuckerberg 3.0 era. One where he says he's done apologizing (even though he's still apologizing) and done with politics (even though politics is not done with him). One where he's trying new looks (including his own designs). So if he wants to take a victory lap with very cool new tech — even if the tech isn't quite ready for prime time? He's going to do that, too. *The entire time I played with Orion, I kept thinking about teenagers I see walking around with a single AirPod in their ear at all times. The idea, supposedly, is that they can keep listening to whatever they want while begrudgingly listening to you, too. I find that half-in, half-out way of interacting with the world incredibly frustrating. But I'm old. Your mileage may vary. **For whatever reason, some Meta people call this a "neural wristband," which makes it seem like it's somehow reading your brain. Thankfully, it is not. ***(I had never heard of this term before this week, either.) Jump to

Title: Meta Will Discontinue Quest 2 & Quest Pro By The End Of The Year

Quest 2 and Quest Pro will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. Meta made the announcement today at Meta Connect 2024. It comes as the company officially revealed and opened preorders for Quest 3S, starting at $300, and announced that it's also discontinuing the 128GB Quest 3 after cutting the price of the 512GB Quest 3 model to $500. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be simplified to: Quest 2 launched in 2020 with a remarkable proposition: a twice as powerful chipset and higher resolution than the original Oculus Quest at a $100 lower price. Sure it also lost the OLED and precise lens separation adjustment of its predecessor, but this didn't seem to matter much as the improved graphics and $300 price point propelled Quest 2 to a level of success no other VR headset has reached before or since. Quest 2 outsold all its predecessors combined within 6 months of being on sale. Meta has now shipped an estimated 20-30 million Quest 2 units through its four years on the market, similar to the number of Xbox Series X/S consoles sold so far. The first major standalone VR games to not support Quest 2 are launching soon, but many other VR apps will likely support Quest 2 for many years to come, and Quest 2's lenses and display will live on in Quest 3S. Building on the success of Quest 2, two years later Meta hoped it could introduce a high-end Quest to serve enthusiasts and businesses. Quest Pro launched in 2022 at $1500. It featured Meta's first pancake lenses, QD-LCD displays with Mini-LED local dimming, eye tracking, face tracking, a battery in the rear of the strap, and ringless self-tracking Touch Pro controllers. In many ways Quest Pro was a pioneering headset. But in others it was lacking. By the time Quest Pro launched, leaks of a Quest 3 arriving a year later with a twice as powerful chipset at half the price had already emerged, severely dampening the headset's value proposition. Further, Quest Pro's underwhelming resolution, grainy passthrough, lack of automatic room sensing for mixed reality, and Meta’s cartoonish avatars not being detailed enough to do the face tracking sensors justice led to mixed-at-best reviews. Just four months after Quest Pro launched Meta cut its price from $1500 to $1000. This kind of price cut so soon after launch was unprecedented, and strongly suggests the headset vastly missed its launch sales targets. By around a year after launch Meta was giving away Quest Pro headsets to Roblox creators, when giving them a Quest 2 would have been perfectly fine. And earlier this year Meta removed the whiteboard, which was designed around the pressure-sensitive stylus tips of Quest Pro's controllers, from Horizon Workrooms. Multiple developers have told UploadVR they see only a tiny fraction of their user base on Quest Pro. As such, almost no Quest game developers took the time to add support for its eye-tracked foveated rendering. When Quest Pro is off the market, Meta will no longer be selling any headsets with eye tracking or face tracking. It's possible one of its Horizon OS partners, such as ASUS or Lenovo, will release a headset with these features some time next year. Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

Title: Meta Just Cut The 512GB Quest 3 To $500 And Will Discontinue The 128GB Model

The 128GB storage model of Quest 3 is being discontinued, and the 512GB model has been cut to its $500 price. Quest 3 launched a year ago with two models, 128GB storage for $500 or 512GB for $650. When stock of the 128GB model depletes, the 512GB option will be the sole Quest 3 model. Until that happens, the 128GB model is available at a discounted price of $430. This announcement comes as Meta just officially revealed and opened preorders for Quest 3S, a cheaper headset that has the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and color passthrough mixed reality capabilities as Quest 3, but uses the old fresnel lenses and single panel from Quest 2. Meta also announced that it's discontinuing Quest 2 and Quest Pro by the end of the year or when stock runs out, whichever comes first. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be simplified to: As well as simplifying Meta's lineup, this move could push many potential Quest 3S 256GB buyers up to Quest 3, since for $100 more they can get a slimmer headset with double the storage, pancake lenses, higher resolution, and precise IPD adjustment.

Title: Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3: More similar than you'd expect
URL: https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3
Time Published: 2024-09-25T17:21:25Z

No offers found You'll be shocked how alike the Meta Quest 3S is to the costlier Quest 3, though some budget-friendly Quest 2 traits return. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Affordable upgrade Meta has made VR more accessible to consumers again by bringing next-gen gaming and mixed reality apps to the same price point that made the Quest 2 so popular. Its lenses and display are unchanged from the previous generation, but it's more powerful and versatile than ever. Full upgrade The Meta Quest 3 has the same game library and graphical power as the Quest 3S but makes those games more visually appealing with more pixels and a wider view. Plus you get all the storage space you could want. Whether that's enough to pay the extra $200 is up to you. The Meta Quest 3S is here as a low-priced alternative to the Quest 3. If you compare the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 closely, you'll note a ton of similarities. Although it looks like a Quest 2 with new cameras, it shares more in common with the newer headset, from performance to accessories. If you're a Quest 2 owner, you might have been put off by the Quest 3's higher price and held off on upgrading. Now, the Quest 3S has the same price and many of the same upgrades; however, Meta has also discounted the Quest 3 512GB from $649 to $499 — the original price for the 128GB Quest 3 — and now's a good time to choose the mainline headset, too. Based on our year testing out the Quest 3 and our Quest 3S hands-on demo at Connect, we'll break down every main similarity and difference between the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3! The Meta Quest 3S is essentially a hybrid between the Quest 2 visuals and Quest 3 hardware. Before breaking down the specific downgrades, we'll explain every way that the Quest 3S will modernize things for Quest 2 users. New CPU & extra RAM: Both the Quest 3 and 3S share the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip and 8GB of RAM. Meta says this combination delivers twice-as-fast GPU performance for faster loading times. Even though the Quest 2 and 3 share most of the same games, the Quest 3 version will often have an exclusive patch with graphical enhancements like higher refresh rates, reduced fog, better lighting and shadows, more enemies or environmental objects on screen at once, better colors, and improved textures. Quest 3 exclusives: Most developers try to target both the Quest 2 and Quest 3, but some upcoming AAA games will be Quest 3 exclusives because they're too graphically demanding for the Quest 2's headset. So far, we know of Batman: Arkham Shadow, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and the recently-released Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded. Aside from those, many other upcoming Quest games are Quest 3-exclusive because they need full-color passthrough with high mixed-reality resolution to work well. Full-color passthrough: Despite the different camera configuration, the Meta Quest 3S has the same 4MP RGB camera with 18 pixels per degree (PPD) passthrough resolution, letting you see your living room in full color, if not at quite the same resolution as full virtual reality. Mixed-reality games were gimmicky and unpolished when the Quest 3 first launched, but these games have improved significantly in 2024; on the hardware end, Meta fixed mixed-reality warping and made MR apps use 80% less GPU processing in software updates over the summer. With the Quest 3S, you're getting a better MR experience right from the start. Controllers: The Meta Quest 3S uses Touch Plus controllers, the same controller generation as the Quest 3. These controllers remove the bulky tracking ring, relying on LEDs around the controller body for inside-out tracking. They also add improved haptics. Weight: Even though the Meta Quest 3S is thicker than the Quest 3, it weighs 1g less (514 vs. 515g), making the fit experience pretty darn comparable. Accessories: We were surprised to learn that most of the best Quest 3 accessories should carry over to the Quest 3S. According to Meta, its first-party carrying case, Elite Strap, Elite Strap with Battery, Touch Plus Active Straps, Compact Charging Dock, and Link cable will work with the Quest 3S, too. We assume that our favorite third-party Elite Straps will work as well; we'll test this as soon as we have our Quest 3S review unit. The obvious aesthetic difference with the front cameras aside, both the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3 look very similar to one another, with the white plastic frame, sensors along the edge, and Meta label in front. One small design difference is that Meta removed the Quest 3's 3.5mm headphone jack from the left arm and moved its right-side USB-C charging port to the left. That gives you fewer headphone options than before; your best bet is wireless earbuds with a USB-C dongle that allows for charging passthrough, so you can still use a battery pack. The Meta Quest 3 was the first to use pancake lenses, with a flattened, reflective design that takes up less horizontal space but also requires more brightness. Most other VR headsets use thicker Fresnel lenses that make them front-heavy and have a noticeable "sweet spot" at the center. Our Quest 3 reviewer specifically praised the pancake lenses for eliminating that sweet spot for better visual clarity. One of the Quest 3S' cost cutbacks is using a Fresnel lens. Meta managed to make the Quest 3S 19.3mm thinner than the Quest 2, but it's still 11.6mm thicker than the Quest 3, shifting the weight forward. Just as many people upgraded the Quest 2 with an Elite Strap for better support and security during fast-paced VR games, you'll probably want the same for the Quest 3S. Visually, the Quest 3 and Quest 3S both use LCDs, but the Quest 3 (2,064 x 2,208) gives you 30% higher resolution than the Quest 3S (1,832 x 1,920, or the same as the Quest 2 display). That, combined with the Fresnel sweet spot, will make the visual experience familiar to Quest 2 owners and detract a bit from the next-gen graphics. Also, the Meta Quest 3S shares the Quest 2's shorter and narrower field of view (FoV) compared to the Quest 3. Unfortunately, the Meta Quest 3S brought back the Quest 2's interpupillary distance (IPD) system to save money. You can slide the lenses to three preset distances — 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm — instead of the IPD wheel and 1mm gaps from 53mm to 75mm you get on the Quest 3. During our hands-on, we found you could slide the Quest 3S lenses in-between those three IPD presets (about 60mm or 65mm), in case your personal IPD doesn't match one of those three presets; it's just trickier and less exact than on the Quest 3. Because the Quest 3S made these lens and design changes, Quest 3 facial interfaces won't work with the Quest 3S; Meta will sell a unique "Quest 3S Breathable Facial Interface" if you want a comfort upgrade for VR workouts. Meta started out selling the Quest 3 in 128GB and 512GB versions, but it's phasing out the 128GB model and making 512GB the default. The Quest 3S will ship in 128GB and 256GB sizes, matching the Quest 2 before it went out of stock. Most casual VR gamers will happily make do with 128GB of space; your average VR game takes up 5GB or less, though some of the major titles are 10GB or more. Both headsets use camera sensors to track your controllers or hands and map your surroundings so you don't hurt yourself, as well as a 4MP RGB camera for full-color passthrough. The only camera difference is that Meta gave the Quest 3 a physical depth sensor to determine how close or far away things are, while the Quest 3S uses software to detect it (as the Quest 2 did). Both the Quest 3 and 3S burn through battery quickly because of the Snapdragon XR2 and 8GB of RAM. But even though the Quest 3S (4,324mAh capacity) has a smaller battery than the Quest 3 (5,060 mAh), Meta estimates that the Quest 3S lasts about 18 minutes longer per charge (2.5 hours versus 2.2 hours). We assume that the Quest 3's higher resolution and brighter pancake lenses require more power, making the Quest 3S more efficient. We've asked Meta for confirmation on this. If you own the Quest 2 and want a new VR headset, then you're probably already happy with the level of immersion the Quest 3S will offer with the same resolution and lens. The Quest 3 resolution and storage boost would certainly be nice to have, but maybe not nice enough to justify spending another $200. Because it has the same CPU and memory, the Quest 3S will handle all the same VR and MR games equally well, receive support for the same amount of time, and do slightly better for battery life. It may feel more front-heavy, but an Elite Strap will fix that; frankly, we think the Quest 3 needs an Elite Strap for long-term comfort too, so you'll have to spend the extra money either way. Even though we'll still rank the Meta Quest 3 as the best VR headset today, the Quest 3S will be good enough for everyone who skipped the pricier headset. Affordable upgrade Choose the Meta Quest 3S if you want the power, game library, and mixed-reality passthrough of the Quest 3 for a lower price. Don't choose it if you dislike the Quest 2's visual experience and want something truly next-gen. Full upgrade Choose the Meta Quest 3 for the most storage, a pixel-packed display, wider field of view, and better hand tracking via the depth sensor. Skip it if you're on a budget and can make do without every possible feature.

Goodbye Quest 2, Quest Pro, and 128GB Quest 3 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has launched the Meta Quest 3S (you can check out our hands on Meta Quest 3S review for our thoughts on it) and introduced us to a new affordable member of the Quest family, and also killed off three others. It’s time to officially say goodbye to the Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and the 128GB model of the Meta Quest 3. The Meta Quest 2 has been sold out everywhere since July, so this announcement isn’t a surprise – it already happened. It’s sad, but with the 3S here, there’s no reason to pick up a Quest 2, frankly. It was fantastic, and I loved it, but it’s time for the next generation of XR hardware. The Meta Quest Pro has been hanging on, but its demise shouldn’t be a shocker. It’s never a good sign when a product drops one-third of its price in just six months on sale, and since the Quest 3 launch – a way cheaper headset that even performs better in a few key areas – the Quest Pro has very much faded into the background. Meta says these devices will still be on sale until the end of the year or until its remaining stock runs dry – whichever comes first. So if you want one for your collection, act fast, but if I were you, I’d pay attention to a different Quest that’s being killed off. My favorite of the trio: the Meta Quest 3 128GB. As leakers reported the day before Meta Connect, the Quest 3 128GB model is also being discontinued. The 512GB Meta Quest 3 will remain on sale, however, at a reduced price of $499.99 / £469.99 / AU$1,049.99. From now until the stock runs out, the 128GB Meta Quest 3 will be on sale for $429.99 / £409.99 / AU$799.99, and it looks like this could be the best headset to buy right now as it has all the upgrades of the full-Quest 3 while still being fairly affordable. Plus, given that VR games and apps aren’t big files 128GB is more than enough – especially as it’s so easy to delete and later redownload titles if you run out of storage. The only downside of this deal is you’ll miss out on the Batman: Arkham Shadow purchase bonus included with the Meta Quest 3S models and 512GB Meta Quest 3. This is a slight incentive to opt for the 512GB model instead, but even if you buy it separately the Meta Quest 3 128GB model is still a solid deal.

Title: Meta discontinues Quest 2 and Quest Pro | TechCrunch

Comment Hidden among the Meta Connect 2024 hardware announcements comes word that the social media giant is sunsetting two key members of its Quest VR headset line. With the budget Quest 3S now up for preorder, Meta will no longer sell the Quest 2 and Quest Pro once back stock is deleted. The end of the Quest 2 isn’t surprising. The headset is long in the tooth, celebrating its fourth birthday in October. Meta kept the legacy device on sale as a way to offer a cheaper alternative to the Quest 3. The new Quest 3S, however, now occupies its place in the lineup with its $300 starting price. It also shares some key characteristics with the new 3S model, including display resolution. The Quest Pro, on the other hand, debuted in 2022 as Meta’s bid to offer up its mixed reality for enterprise. The truth is, however, that last year’s Quest 3 made the Pro model largely redundant, and did so at a lower price point. Here’s what Meta has to say on the matter: “[Y]ou know what they say about new beginnings. With Quest 3S on the shelf, we’re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We’ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first. If you’d like a carrying case, the Touch Pro controllers, the Quest 2 Active Pack, or any of the other accessories for Quest 2 and Pro, we plan to continue selling those for a bit longer.” Notably, Meta is also ending security patch updates for the original Quest headset in September. Presumably such support for the Quest 2 and Quest Pro 2 will last a while longer. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

Title: 512GB Quest 3 Gets a Big Price Drop While 128GB Model is Phased Out

Say goodbye to the 128GB version of Quest 3, as the company is slated to only offer the 512GB version moving forward, and at a new, more attractive price. With the entrance of Quest 3S, and the discontinuation of Quest 2 and Quest Pro, Meta’s lineup is shifting a bit to make way for its new entry level XR headset, Quest 3S. Released in late 2023 for $650, the 512GB version of Quest 3 is still the company’s best-in-class headset. But now Quest 3 (512GB) is is dropping to just $500. Meanwhile, Quest 3 (128GB), which was originally $500, is being phased out. Meta is pricing Quest 3 (128GB) at $430 until supply is gone. Although the Quest 3 (128GB) price cut isn’t massive, it’s certainly not something to sneeze at if you absolutely need a great XR headset today and don’t want to go down a half-step with Quest 3S, which is being offered starting at $300 for the 128GB version and $400 for the 256GB version. Quest 3S is slated to launch on October 15th, offering the same resolution and Fresnel optics as Quest 2, but with the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR gen 2 chipset as of Quest 3. Check out the full specs compared side-by-side to see how it stacks up. This article may contain affiliate links.

I think 10/15/2024, when the 3s is released. Prices already lowered in UK. Funny, I'm over here still rocking a 64GB Quest 2 and they didn't even list it LOL. I may have to grab that 128GB Quest 3S though. Looks nice. If it will run the new Batman game coming out, I'm all on board….

Title: Quest 2 and Quest Pro are Being Discontinued, Encouraging Wider Adoption of Mixed Reality

Out with the old, in with the new. Meta announced that the cheap and cheerful Quest 2 and the company’s pricey mixed reality pioneer Quest Pro are officially getting the boot, marking Meta’s next big push to bring mixed reality to the masses. There aren’t any official figures going around, but it’s safe to say Quest 2 was Meta’s most popular VR headset to date, coming just one year after the launch of the original Quest, which was released in May 2019. Still, even nearly three years after release, Quest 2 was so popular last Holiday season it handily outsold Quest 3 on Amazon. While it’s impossible to say whether Quest 3S will live up to Quest 2’s legacy, at an aggressive $300 price point for the entry-level 128GB model, it has a pretty good chance of again attracting plenty of eyeballs when it launches October 15th. So much can’t be said for Quest Pro, which always felt more like an expensive mixed reality dev kit than a consumer device, launching in 2022 for an eye-watering $1,500. Granted, Meta relented somewhat, bringing it down to $1,000 nearly a year after launch, likely owing to its overly exclusionary price point and lack of compelling MR content—something Meta hopes to deliver on starting with Quest 3S. That said, we’re unlikely to recommend Quest Pro over Quest 3 or Quest 3S due to the upcoming slate of Quest 3-exclusive content that notably doesn’t support Quest Pro. And with that, Meta is now officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Quest Pro. Remaining stock will be sold through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first, Meta says. Accessories for both are still going to be on offer, such as carrying cases, Touch Pro controllers, Quest 2 Active Pack, or any of the other accessories for Quest 2 and Pro, with Meta noting it will to continue selling those “for a bit longer” after Quest 2 and QUest Pro headset supplies dry up. So, out with the old, in the with the new. Check out our hands-on with Quest 3S to get the full details on just why Meta thinks you might want its next XR headset.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont said on Tuesday, in a Senate committee hearing on high anti-obesity drug prices, that he agreed with Elon Musk, a supporter of Former President Donald Trump, when it comes to expanding access to GLP-1 weight loss drugs. These treatments, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. The most popular GLP-1 drugs on the market are Ozempic (NVO) and Wegovy, both of which are produced by Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk. “Solving obesity greatly reduces risk of other diseases, especially diabetes, and improves quality of life. We do need to find a way to make appetite inhibitors available to anyone who wants them,” Musk posted last week on X (TSLA), the social media platform he owns. The post was made in response to a post about Sen. Sanders claiming that generic drug companies have said they can sell cheaper versions of these medications for less than $100 a month. In the U.S., the list price — a drug’s price without health insurance — for Ozempic is $968.52 for a month’s supply. The list price of Wegovy in the U.S. is $1,349.02. The cost of these popular medications is already much cheaper in other countries. For example, Ozempic is just $59 in Germany and Wegovy is only $92 in the U.K. “I don’t agree with Bernie about many things, but I do on this,” Musk wrote. Sen. Sanders grilled Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen Tuesday morning during a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), regarding what the company charges for its blockbuster drugs in the U.S. Sen. Sanders said that Novo Nordisk has made $50 billion in sales from Ozempic and Wegovy since 2018 — with 72% of that revenue coming from U.S. sales, Sen. Sanders said at Tuesday’s hearing. “In other words, the United States is Novo Nordisk’s cash cow for Ozempic and Wegovy,” Sen. Sanders said. At one point, Sen. Sanders quoted Musk’s tweet and said that “Mr. Musk is right.” Later that day, Musk posted on X that he really is “with Bernie on this one.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Ever since shares of Nvidia (NVDA) reached an all-time high in June, the chipmaker’s stock has experienced some turbulence — but its market cap is still up over 150% so far this year. Nvidia’s shares were up 2.37% during mid-day trading Monday at $123.73 per share — down around 9% from its record-high close price of $135.58 on June 18, days after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split. Still, the chipmaker’s shares have climbed around 156.86% so far this year, boosting its market cap just above $3 trillion and making it the third-most valuable company in the world. Compared with a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up over 190%. The company has been one of the biggest winners of the generative artificial intelligence boom due to high demand for its Hopper graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are used for training and inferencing of some of the world’s most powerful AI models. Meanwhile, samples of Nvidia’s latest AI platform, Blackwell, are shipping to customers, and the product is expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter into fiscal year 2026. In August, reports that Blackwell was delayed due to design flaws sent Nvidia’s shares down. In June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Just weeks later, it overtook both Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company. Despite falling back into third place, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world. In February, it became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after reporting record fourth-quarter earnings. However, despite reporting another record quarter that beat Wall Street’s expectations, Nvidia’s shares slipped in August, reflecting unimpressed investors who want more from the chipmaker.

Title: Tucker Carlson Bizarrely Claims Alex Jones is ‘Vindicated on Everything’

SEARCH The right-wing figures appear to be as buddy-buddy as ever, with Alex Jones telling Tucker Carlson on stage Tuesday, “I gotta say, I love you.” Breaking News Reporter Tucker Carlson’s embracing of the right-wing fringes reached a new extreme Tuesday after he welcomed the infamous, mass-shooting-denying conspiracist Alex Jones on stage with him as part of his speaking tour. Carlson, addressing a crowd of paying attendees in Pennsylvania, sung Jones’ praises and said he was “proud” to be alongside the 50-year-old Infowars founder who he said has been “vindicated on everything.” Carlson, 55, went as far as calling the far-right provocateur “the most extraordinary person” he’d ever met. That’s a sharp contrast from Carlson’s comments about Jones in Jan. 2012, when he said Jones, who was then peddling Sept. 11 attacks conspiracies, “freaks me out.” Carlson’s glowing statements about Jones on Tuesday is sure to enrage the families of Sandy Hook victims, who lost their elementary-aged loved ones in a horrific mass slaying in 2012 that Jones repeatedly claimed was a hoax carried out by crisis actors. Jones didn’t just keep his cooky beliefs to himself, unfortunately. He led a smear campaign against the grieving parents of victims, which led to incessant harassment in what was likely the lowest moment of their lives. That hateful conduct is what has Jones on the hook for $1.4 billion as part of a pair of defamation judgements against him in Texas and Connecticut. Those judgements also appear to be killing off InfoWars as we know it. A bankruptcy court said Tuesday it would auction off the assets of Infowars’ parent company, which will see it sell off everything from lighting fixtures to Jones’ dubious vitamin and supplement store. All of that money will then be directed to the families impacted by his lies. With Jones’ personal outlet for spilling his rage now in its final days, he might find a new platform at Carlson’s side. He already sat down for an interview with Carlson in June and certainly appeared buddy-buddy with him again on Tuesday, telling the former network news host in his intro, “I gotta say, I love you.” Jones went on to speak with his typical fiery rhetoric, declaring that if Donald Trump is elected again, “all of us, together, are going to lift the curse off of this country and we’re going to send the globalists to prison.” Jones added that he could “feel the strength in this auditorium” on Tuesday night. “It is amazing to meet all these great people,” Jones said, “whether they’re Black, white, old, young, to see the electricity in people’s eyes that are populist and that are Americans and that love God and that love children and love freedom and hate tyranny.” Carlson interrupted Jones shortly after, saying: “It just makes me laugh. Alex Jones, so controversial. Love God, love America, love freedom. Oh, you’re so radical!” Jones then took back the spotlight, using it to again rail against “globalists.” “I’m for the war, peacefully with information, against the globalists,” he said. “The real war is here with the globalists and [George] Soros and [Barack] Obama and the New World Order and [investment firm] BlackRock. They’ve declared war on us and we accept the challenge. We’re taking the country back.” New York magazine reported that a journalist in attendance spotted more Jones merchandise, like his slogan-filled shirts, than they saw Carlson-branded merch, which was actually being sold in the arena. The far-right activist Jack Posobiec also spoke Tuesday, but New York reported that he was significantly upstaged by the presence of Jones, who was introduced just after him. “Jones came out to a roaring crowd, all on their feet with phones in hand,” the magazine reported, adding that “every single line was an applause line, and the crowd got to the end of Jones’s catchphrases before he did.” “If they want a fight,” Jones began at point, “you better believe they got one!” the screaming crowd answered for him. New York reported that Tuesday’s stage was designed for a panel-style talk, but “it soon became clear that the rest of the night would belong to Jones.” “Once he locked in, howling into the middle distance in front of him, there was no interrupting or restraining him short of a blow dart,” it added.

Title: Railway fired by fresh ambition as they look forward to new campaign

Full Content:
The IRFU’s decision to play the women’s Energia All-Ireland League final at the Aviva Stadium for the first time last April as part of a double header was thoroughly vindicated as UL Bohemians and Railway Union served up an entertaining 13-try feast. Rejuvenated under new head coach Fiona Hayes, the Limerick club’s 48-38 win secured their 14th title and capped off a brilliant season by completing the double, having also beaten Railway 34-12 in the All-Ireland Cup final. No team will be more determined to dethrone UL Bohs than Railway, who finished a point behind the Limerick club in the 16-game regular season after avenging a 10-7 defeat at Annacotty in November with a 43-22 win in Park Avenue a fortnight before the final. “Bohs deserved to win on the day,” said Railway captain and outside entre Niamh Byrne, a try scorer on league final day, who also saw the bigger picture. “But it was a high-scoring game which went down to the last few minutes so it was a good advertisement. It was actually very exciting to be a part of, if disappointing on our side. There’s always a loser but a great day. Everything aligned perfectly. We’ll look to go again but we’ll remember that one.” Railway have shaken up their coaching ticket, with Mike South promoted to head coach, while Irish internationals Ailsa Hughes and Lindsay Peat will take on key player/coach roles with the backs and forwards. A well-run and closely knit club, Byrne believes the shake-up should be fairly seamless. Railway have a tough start on Saturday at home to Old Belvedere, the only other team to beat them last season when finishing third in the final standings. Tullow make their competitive debut in Division One at home to Wicklow while UL Bohs begin the defence of their title away to Blackrock, the second most successful side in the tournament’s history. ‘Rock won their sixth title two years ago by beating Railway in the final and finished fourth last season. Hot on the heels of those opening day contests, UL Bohs and Railway meet in a reprise of last season’s final on the UL 4G pitch in round two on Saturday week, so meaning the return fixture is again in the penultimate round next March. “We have a very competitive but good rivalry,” says Byrne of last season’s final pairing. “It’s the first fixture we look for in the calendar. It’s always a competitive match but, outside of it, we all get on very well and there’s good friendships there.” The improvement in the Under-18 interpros means there is more scope for changes in personnel and, for example, Galwegians, who host Ballincollig at Crowley Park on Saturday, will take encouragement from an infusion of young players who helped make Connacht very competitive in the senior interpros. “It’s getting more competitive each year and now we’ll see who comes quickly out of the blocks,” says Byrne. A relatively new force in the women’s club game, Railway were champions either side of the pandemic in 2019 and 2022 before losing the last two finals. “Obviously our main goal would be to get into that Aviva final and hopefully make it our day there. But equally, we have a lot of new people this season and hopefully [we can] lay the foundations for the next few years.” With the upturn in the fortunes of the Ireland women’s team, who play their first WXV1 game against world champions New Zealand in Vancouver on Sunday (3am Monday Irish time), Byrne says: “There’s more people aware of women’s rugby. With every year it’s growing and there’s more people backing us; supporters, the IRFU, sponsors and I think women’s rugby in Ireland is building to be something.” Women’s Division One (All matches Saturday at 5pm): Blackrock College v UL Bohemian, Stradbrook; Galwegians v Ballincollig, Crowley Park; Railway Union v Old Belvedere, Willow Lodge; Suttonians v Cooke, JJ McDowell Memorial Ground; Tullow v Wicklow, The Black Gates.

Title: The Biggest Supreme Court Cases to Watch This Term
URL: https://time.com/7024317/supreme-court-term-cases-2024/
Time Published: 2024-09-25T15:42:28Z
Full Content:
The U.S. Supreme Court returns to the bench on Oct. 7 to start a new term that includes cases on transgender rights, guns, pornography, flavored vapes, and more. In the coming months, the court will hear a case that will examine the constitutionality of state bans on medical treatments for transgender minors. It will hear two others that could radically reshape regulations on ghost guns and redefine corporate accountability in the tech industry. And it may confront urgent election-related litigation after Nov. 5 that tests the limits of the Electoral Count Act, depending on the aftermath of the presidential election. The new term begins as the Supreme Court is grappling with significant internal challenges and public scrutiny, as concerns about undisclosed gifts to certain Justices and ideologically divided decisions on some of the nation’s most divisive issues has raised questions about transparency and impartiality within the institution. A July 2024 survey from the Pew Research Center found that 47% of Americans express a favorable opinion of the court following a consequential term, in which it granted presidents broad criminal immunity for some actions in office, preserved access to an abortion pill, and upheld a law that prevents those under a restraining order for domestic violence from possessing guns. Here are some of the key cases coming up this term. Perhaps the highest-profile case already on the docket, United States v. Skrmetti could have significant implications for transgender rights across the country. The case focuses on a Tennessee law that prohibits certain medical treatments for transgender minors, including puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and gender-transition surgeries. The case marks the first time the Justices will weigh in on the constitutionality of statewide bans of this nature, which have proliferated in approximately two dozen Republican-led states in recent years. The Tennessee law, known as SB1, has already stirred considerable controversy, with the Biden Administration and various advocacy groups arguing that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar has contended that the law discriminates against transgender individuals by allowing these medical interventions for other medical conditions while categorically banning them for gender dysphoria. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti defends the law as a necessary measure to protect minors from potentially irreversible treatments that may be based on "uncertain" benefits. The Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case comes at a time of increasing legal fragmentation regarding transgender healthcare, with different federal courts issuing conflicting rulings. Legal analysts suggest that the Supreme Court’s ruling could establish a landmark precedent not only on transgender medical care but also on broader issues of civil rights, including access to public facilities and participation in sports. In Garland v. VanDerStok, the Justices will hear a case that challenges the Biden Administration’s regulation of ghost guns—untraceable firearms that can be assembled from kits and lack serial numbers. The case represents a critical moment in the ongoing debate over gun control, as the regulation was designed to combat the increasing prevalence of these weapons in crime scenes across the country. The rule, implemented in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), expands the definition of a firearm under the Gun Control Act of 1968. It mandates that unfinished parts, such as gun frames and receivers, must be serialized and licensed, ensuring that they can be traced. The regulation also requires background checks for the sale of these components. However, it has faced pushback from gun owners and manufacturers, who argue that it overreaches the authority granted to the ATF and violates the original intent of federal firearm laws. A federal appeals court upheld a lower court’s decision to strike down the regulation. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor contended that the definition of a firearm does not encompass kits and parts, arguing that such interpretations should be the purview of Congress, not the judiciary. The ruling raised alarms among some law enforcement and advocacy groups, which fear that a Supreme Court decision against the regulation could lead to an influx of ghost guns, complicating efforts to address gun violence. The Supreme Court is set to determine the legality of a Texas law mandating age verification for users of pornographic websites. The case, Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, could have significant implications for First Amendment rights, as the state law, enacted in June 2023, aims to restrict minors from accessing sexually explicit content by requiring users to provide personal information for age verification. Proponents of the law, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, argue that it is necessary to protect minors from exposure to harmful material. They assert that requiring age verification ensures that only adults can access pornography, thus addressing a pressing public safety concern. However, critics, including the Free Speech Coalition, contend that the law infringes upon the constitutional rights of adults, creating a chilling effect on access to protected speech. They argue that the measure is overbroad and fails to account for the privacy risks associated with submitting personal information online. Read More: How an Ordained Rabbi Ended Up Owning the World’s Most Famous Porn Company A federal district judge initially blocked the law, citing concerns that it imposes unnecessary restrictions on adult access to constitutionally protected material. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later permitted the law to take effect, ruling that the age verification requirement is rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in preventing minors from accessing pornography. However, dissenting opinions within the panel highlighted the law's potential to limit access to protected speech for adults, raising questions about its constitutionality. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments, a case that will evaluate the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to deny marketing authorization for flavored e-cigarettes produced by Triton Distribution. The case comes amid ongoing concerns about the popularity of vaping among young people and the agency's efforts to regulate products that might appeal to minors. At the heart of the dispute is the FDA's rejection of applications for sweet-flavored e-liquids, including varieties such as "Jimmy The Juice Man Peachy Strawberry" and "Killer Kustard Blueberry." The agency contends that these products pose a "serious, well-documented risk" of enticing young users, contributing to alarming rates of e-cigarette use among adolescents. In 2020, nearly 20% of high school students reported using e-cigarettes, with flavored options being the overwhelming choice, the FDA said in court documents. They have argued that companies failed to demonstrate that the benefits of their products for adult smokers outweighed the risks of underage consumption. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously sided with Triton, declaring that the FDA had acted in an "arbitrary and capricious" manner by imposing new requirements for studies on smoking cessation that had not been communicated prior to the companies’ applications. The implications of the case could extend beyond flavored e-cigarettes. The court's decision may clarify the FDA's authority under the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, which mandates that new tobacco products be proven “appropriate for the protection of the public health.” The Justices will hear Meta’s appeal in a high-stakes class action lawsuit related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which has drawn significant scrutiny over the misuse of user data. The high court will review a decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that allowed the lawsuit, spearheaded by Amalgamated Bank on behalf of shareholders, to proceed. Investors allege that Meta misled them about the risks associated with Facebook user data being improperly accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The lawsuit claims that inadequate disclosures led to substantial drops in Meta’s stock price in 2018, following revelations that the personal information of approximately 87 million Facebook users had been exploited without consent. The litigation, initiated in 2018, accuses Meta and its executives of violating the Securities Exchange Act by making false statements regarding data security risks that had already materialized. In its defense, Meta argues that the 9th Circuit's ruling sets a troubling precedent that could require public companies to disclose historical incidents that do not pose current risks. Meta has already faced penalties, including a $5 billion fine and a $725 million settlement related to user privacy violations. In NVIDIA v. E. Ohman J, the Supreme Court will consider a case that challenges the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of fraudulent intent in shareholder class action lawsuits. The core of the dispute revolves around allegations that Nvidia misrepresented its dependence on the volatile cryptocurrency mining market, leading to significant financial losses for investors. Shareholders claim that the company’s CEO made misleading statements about demand for its products, failing to disclose crucial information that could indicate a risk of mismanagement. At the heart of the case is the legal standard for establishing "scienter," or the intent to deceive, which requires plaintiffs to present specific facts demonstrating that a defendant acted with knowledge or reckless disregard. Nvidia, whose computer chips the world relies on to make AI systems, argues that the Ninth Circuit improperly accepted vague allegations from unnamed former employees and speculative analyses from hired experts, rather than concrete evidence of fraudulent intent. The company contends that such reliance on speculation undermines the stringent requirements set forth in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. A ruling in favor of Nvidia could reinforce higher standards for investor claims and potentially reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits, while a decision that supports the Ninth Circuit's stance might embolden shareholders to pursue more claims based on less concrete evidence, experts say.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed deciding on Nasdaq’s proposed rule change to allow the listing and trading of options on BlackRock’s Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). This comes despite the SEC recently approving options trading for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which marked a significant development for spot Bitcoin ETFs. While the Securities and Exchange Commission was initially expected to give its decision on BlackRock Ethereum options trading on Sept. 26, the regulator has now postponed making the ruling to Nov. 10. “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change,” the SEC said in a Tuesday press release. In a separate filing, the top Wall Street watchdog also delayed a decision on NYSE American LLC’s proposed rule change to list and trade options on the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. The new deadline for NYSE American has been set for Nov. 11. If approved, these options on the ETH ETFs will follow the same listing and trading rules as other trusts, including criteria for underlying securities, expirations, strike prices, and trading halts. The Nasdaq International Securities Exchange submitted a filing with the SEC proposing a rule change to list and trade options tied to BlackRock’s ETHA on August 6. The move seeks to broaden the range of investment tools for Ethereum and make crypto investments more accessible for traditional investors. The exchange also said the rule change would benefit investors by offering a lower-cost way to gain exposure to the second-largest crypto by market cap, Ether, and meet their investment needs, which generally involve hedging and speculation. For the uninitiated, options are an important vehicle for traders looking to hedge against possible losses in their investments or to bet on the future price of an underlying asset, like a stock or ETF. Options offer flexibility as they give the buyer the right to buy or sell an asset at a set price and on an agreed date. Shortly after Nasdaq’s filing, NYSE American submitted a proposal to list and trade options on trusts managed by Grayscale and Bitwise. The postponement on Tuesday came after the SEC approved options trading for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) last week. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the move as a “huge win” for Bitcoin ETFs as it is expected to attract more liquidity and, subsequently, more “big fish.”

Bitcoin is climbing higher when writing, technically bullish but steadying below August highs. Even though there are pockets of strength and the general market sentiment is bullish, looking at the CoinMarketCap poll, buyers should do more. A break above the $65,000 and $66,000 resistance zone could spark a wave of demand that may lift the coin to all-time highs. There will be roadblocks at the $70,000 and $72,000 levels. If buyers take charge and the coin retests to all-time highs, one analyst on X warns that those who sell at that level will be making a “disastrous” mistake. From his outlook, exiting at around $74,000 will be “way too early” since the coin could rip higher. Technically, the coin remains within a bullish formation. In the monthly chart, buyers are in control despite the dip after the rally to an all-time high in March 2024. Specifically, BTC prices are confined inside a bull flag. A close above the resistance trendline could trigger a lift-off, confirming gains of Q4 2023 and Q1 2024. Though technical candlestick formation may favor bulls, fundamental factors play a crucial role based on the analyst’s point of view. The analyst argues that selling at around $74,000 will be a mistake because, among other factors, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is propping up the country’s economy by injecting liquidity. Thus far, the analyst notes that the central bank released their 10-point easing plan to stimulate the struggling Chinese economy. The decision to inject liquidity and slash rates could positively impact the globe. Due to the increasing global liquidity, Bitcoin could benefit from a more accommodative monetary policy from China, Japan, and the United States. Moreover, Bitcoin may find support from the weakening USD index (DXY). As the greenback weakens, other economies, including those in Europe, may choose to support their economies further. The move, in turn, would see capital flow to hard assets like Bitcoin. Already, gold is trending at near all-time highs, and Bitcoin could follow the yellow metal as investors buy them to protect themselves from high inflation. The analyst also pointed out other developments, including the United States approving the application by BlackRock to list and permit the trading of Options for IBIT, their spot Bitcoin ETF. Coupled with banks, including BNY Mellon, showing interest in Bitcoin custody, it could mark the start of fund managers accepting BTC on behalf of their clients.

Title: A weight loss drug maker is aiming for a big IPO

BioAge Labs, a biopharmaceutical startup focused on obesity drugs, is looking to raise nearly $200 million in its recently expanded, planned initial public offering, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Richmond, California-based company said on Wednesday that it plans to offer 10.5 million shares between $17 and $19 each. BioAge previously planned to only offer 7.5 million shares at the same price range. The updated SEC filing comes amid a surge of investor interest in a new class of weight loss medications known as GLP-1s. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk’s stock has climbed 39%, while Eli Lilly’s has surged 68%. These gains reflect investors’ bullish outlook on the future of the obesity drug market. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for GLP-1 drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. BioAge is now trying to get in on the action. In its filing, the company said it is targeting obesity and diabetes drugs due to their “high prevalence and resulting potential for impact on population health” and “outsized commercial opportunities.” BioAge’s leading drug candidate is azelaprag, a pill that mimics apelin, a peptide released during exercise that decreases with age. Early clinical trial results suggest that taking azelaprag along with an injectable weight loss drug results in increased weight loss and prevents muscle mass loss, a side-effect of current weight loss drugs. BioAge started a phase 2 clinical trial this year of azelaprag in combination with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. The company plans to start a second phase 2 trial of the drug next year to see how it works with semaglutide, the drug behind Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic. BioAge’s upcoming IPO comes just months after it raised $170 million in financing this past February. BioAge isn’t the only company working to disrupt the weight loss drug duopoly dominated by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Surging demand for weight loss medications has transformed the two pharmaceutical developers into some of the world’s most valuable companies — potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Now several drug makers are racing to develop their own weight loss competitors. Viking Therapeutics is developing both a weight loss injection and a pill while large pharma companies like Roche and Pfizer are also working on their own anti-obesity drugs.

Title: BlackRock’s head of digital assets says Bitcoin is risky, but still a ‘risk-off’ asset

BlackRock exec Robbie Mitchnick believes that the long-term drivers of Bitcoin are significantly different from that of risk-on assets. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick believes the crypto industry has made a marketing blunder when it comes to Bitcoin (BTC). Mitchnick said during an interview with Bloomberg that Bitcoin is a risky asset, but calling it a “risk-on” asset is a mistake akin to an “own goal.” A risk-on asset, like stocks, is something that investors buy when they are optimistic about the market and are willing to take more risk. Therefore, a “risk-off asset” is where investors move their money when they’re worried about market volatility. Gold, for example, is considered a risk-off asset because it is likely to hold or increase in value despite economic downturns. Mitchnick said: “Some of the crypto research type publications and daily commentaries have taken the fact that Bitcoin, which is obviously a risky asset, and extrapolated that to say that therefore it is a risk-on asset and should trade like equities.” He further explained that Bitcoin acts in a fundamentally different way than equities and other risk-on assets. Mitchnick added that the long-term drivers of Bitcoin are “very different” from other risk-on assets and in some cases, may even be “inverted.” Additionally, Bitcoin does not carry the risks that are usually associated with other risk-on assets. Mitchnick said: “When we think about Bitcoin, we think about it primarily as an emerging global monetary alternative—[a] scarce, global, decentralized, non-sovereign asset. And it’s an asset that has no country-specific risk, that has no counterparty risk.” According to Mitchnick, these properties make Bitcoin an intriguing alternative for investors who are concerned about the risks of printing money, currency devaluation, as well as political and fiscal sustainability challenges. Furthermore, its properties are fundamentally different from other risk-on assets, which is why calling Bitcoin a risk-on asset only confuses investors. Mitchnick also pointed out that, like gold, Bitcoin is not correlated to US stocks in the long term. While in the short term, the correlation can spike, on average, it remains “pretty close to zero,” resembling the pattern followed by gold. He further stated that there are only three or four things in a year that actually impact the price of Bitcoin significantly. However, this leaves little scope for publications to create daily stories. Therefore, Mitchnick believes that reporters often instinctively correlate fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price with the unemployment rate, the stock market, or manufacturing. However, these events and incidents have “no connection to Bitcoin.” Source: CryptoSlate Bitcoin Ecosystem Crypto Sector Data In 2020, Monika immersed herself in crypto, maintaining skepticism yet firmly believing blockchain could address key issues like financial disparity and transparency.

Title: Data Centers At The Heart Of The AI And Digital Economy Surge

Massive Data Center Buildouts Next To Reliable Power And Telecomunication Hubs. Data centers have quietly evolved from obscure server warehouses tucked away in industrial parks to the backbone of our digital society. Once considered dull, gray structures, these facilities have become the critical infrastructure that powers everything we rely on today—social media, artificial intelligence-driven innovations, and daily conveniences like navigation apps and ride-sharing. These high-security buildings are now as essential as highways and airports, connecting us to the digital economy that fuels our lives. However, their newfound importance comes with a host of challenges, and how we respond will dictate the pace of societal progress. The New Digital Frontier It's hard to believe that just a few decades ago, data centers were little more than warehouses for servers, often located in remote or economically disadvantaged areas. The internet boom of the late 1990s put data centers on the map, with companies like Exodus Communications pioneering the concept of large-scale data centers. But as with many tech trends, the early 2000s saw a crash. Overzealous investments led to an overbuild that left many data centers underutilized for years. Fast forward to 2024, and we are witnessing another data center boom. This time, the demand is not only driven by a rapidly expanding internet but by a digital society that never sleeps—compounded by artificial intelligence, which is creating an unprecedented need for computing power. Data Centers Matter Now More Than Ever Today, the U.S. data center market is experiencing explosive growth. According to JLL, the market has doubled in size since 2020, with a compound annual growth rate of 21%. Vacancy rates are at an all-time low of 3% and are rapidly approaching zero. According to Houlihan Lokey, this soaring demand is fueling a construction boom, with 5.3 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity under construction as of mid-2024, and 22 GW planned to meet the increasing need for digital infrastructure. But it’s not just the volume that’s rising—colocation rents, the cost of leasing space within data centers, have surged by as much as 37% year-over-year. No longer just a utility, data centers are now a premium asset in the digital economy. Artificial intelligence is the primary driver behind this data center explosion. AI-related capital expenditures now exceed $300 billion, and the technology accounts for 20% of all new data center demand. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are at the forefront, developing hyperscale data centers that stretch the limits of computing power. From self-driving cars to facial recognition, artificial intelligence consumes vast amounts of computational resources. Every time you interact with a digital assistant, use a navigation app, or even send flowers online, you are tapping into the enormous power of a data center. Powering The Future: The Sustainability Crisis This unprecedented demand, however, comes at a cost: electricity. Data centers are massive energy consumers, and as the number of facilities grows, so does the strain on the U.S. power grid. The rise of electric vehicles and increased manufacturing demands further compound the issue, pushing power availability to the brink of crisis. Some estimates suggest that data centers alone could account for 20% of global electricity demand by the end of the decade. To combat this, industry leaders are turning to alternative energy solutions. For example, Amazon Web Services is exploring nuclear energy to power its massive campuses. This race for sustainable solutions isn’t just about cutting costs—it’s about survival in an increasingly energy-hungry world. Investor Confidence Soars Despite these challenges, investor confidence in the data center market remains at an all-time high. Cap rates—a measure of return on investment in real estate—have remained stable between 6-7%, buoyed by strong demand for digital infrastructure and rising rents. Valuations of leading data center companies like Digital Realty Trust and Switch have reached unprecedented levels. Heavyweights such as BlackRock and Microsoft are pouring hundreds of billions into expanding data center infrastructure, signaling that the sector isn’t just a short-term play—it’s a long-term investment in the future of the digital economy. A Call To Action: Building With Purpose, Not Panic The data center industry is poised for a bright future, but it’s crucial to learn from the mistakes of the past. During the dot-com boom, over-exuberance and a lack of strategic foresight led to a catastrophic overbuild that took years to correct. As we rush to meet today’s demand, we must plan with purpose. It’s not enough to simply build more data centers. We need to build them with their specific use case in mind: Is it for hyperscale operations, artificial intelligence processing, or corporate IT? This means situating facilities near reliable power sources and connectivity hubs while ensuring they have access to renewable or responsible energy solutions—whether solar, natural gas, or nuclear. The industry cannot afford another bubble, especially with stakes higher than ever before. Thoughtful planning today will set the foundation for sustainable growth tomorrow. Data centers are no longer just the backbone of the internet—they are the foundation of our digital world. But with this influence comes responsibility. The decisions we make today about data center construction, energy consumption, and workforce development will shape the digital infrastructure of the future. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Backpedaling On ESG Commitments Will Inevitably Backfire

At a time when many companies are dialing down their prior commitments on sustainability, building trust and maintaining credibility in corporate communication has never been more important. Don't make ESG promises that you don't intend to keep. BlackRock, Unilever, JP Morgan Chase— the list keeps growing when it comes to ESG backpedaling. And at a time when more eyes than ever are watching for slip-ups, not following through on commitments exposes a company to reputational risks. However, these self-inflicted wounds are avoidable as long as companies recognize the importance of balancing financial performance and ESG commitments, and make a robust internal review before taking a public stand on hot-button topics. BlackRock is learning that lesson now. After announcing a strong stance on ESG in 2020 ,“committed to putting sustainability at the center of our investment process,” the world’s largest asset manager recently backed away, citing higher-than-expected costs and lower-than-expected returns on green energy and other ESG-related assets. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, explained the change as consistent with the company’s core mission to maximize returns to investors. “If a customer wants to invest 100% in decarbonization, and financial profitability is not its priority, we will invest accordingly,” Fink told the French daily Le Figaro in June 2024. “But most of our investors want us to provide them with the best financial profitability.” He added, "In reality, the energy transition is much more complex than we imagined." BlackRock’s 2024 about-face, versus its 2020 stance, has generated scathing criticism, with the company being accused of having taken an opportunistic stand rather than showing genuine commitment to ESG goals. Of course companies, like individuals, are entitled to change their minds. But those changes should not modify the core of the company’s values. Values should be unshakeable and not subject to short-term market forces. BlackRock’s mistake was that it committed to an ESG course of action without fully realizing the implications. Once its ESG commitment was deemed too expensive and threatened to harm financial performance, the company backtracked on what it had previously upheld as a bedrock principle. BlackRock is not alone. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently drew sharp criticism from U.S. senators over the bank’s continued financing of fossil-fuel, despite longstanding public statements in support of battling climate change. Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer goods giant, has been long seen as a leader in sustainability. The new CEO, Hein Schumacher, recently announced the company would be dialing down some of its previously stated ESG targets. Did the backpedaling occur because stock analysts had criticized Unilever for over-emphasizing ESG instead of financial performance? Contrast these companies with the likes of Patagonia, known for its consistent alignment of business practices with environmental values. In its 51-year history, Patagonia has maintained profitability while staying true to its core environmental beliefs. The fact that Patagonia is a small, privately held company no doubt helps it stay insulated from stock-market pressures. However, Costco, the third largest retailer in the world after WalMart and Amazon, regularly features on most-admired lists because of its competitive prices which are founded on good labor practices, good relations with suppliers, and good customer service. Costco’s net income has risen steadily for the past four years. Writing in Harvard Business Review, Andrew Winston analyzes the types of attacks companies are now facing on ESG and sustainability. While he notes that the criticism may be motivated by different interests, issues, or politics, his advice to companies is largely the same. “Do what fits the values of the company and what seems right.” Further, “Build better, more resilient businesses that profit by helping solve big challenges.” For Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey, merging business practice, values, and corporate communications is simple. “…for my basic product, I want to be water positive, I want to have a circular economy on my packaging, and I want to grow our business with less sugar—you can call it anything you like, but no one with common sense says those are bad ideas.” In the corporate world, consistency is still the key to maintaining the trust of investors, employees, suppliers, customers, and other external stakeholders such as ratings agencies and NGOs. So, from a communications standpoint remember to: - Communicate genuine commitment to the company’s values. - Develop strategies for transparent and consistent communication that build and preserve trust. In a nutshell, say what you do, and do what you say. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Court Calls The Terms Of Ryan Breslow’s $450 Million Bolt Deal A ‘Prisoner’s Dilemma’
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2024/09/25/court-calls-the-terms-of-ryan-breslows-450-million-bolt-deal-a-prisoners-dilemma/

The Delaware Court of Chancery has extended an order stalling Bolt founder Ryan Breslow’s bid to raise $450 million, characterizing the cram-down round as a “prisoner’s dilemma” for investors. Bolt's proposed $450 million round would see the young founder return to the company as CEO. Bolt and its cofounder Ryan Breslow were dealt a series of stinging remarks from a Delaware judge last week, during a hearing to continue a temporary restraining order on the company’s controversial $450 million funding round. The halt on the Series F financing was requested by a trio of irate Bolt investors including the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, and has been extended through mid-October. It is the latest snag in Breslow’s ongoing bid to raise fresh capital for the struggling payments company. The round, which was first announced in August and would value Bolt at $14 billion, has already been hamstrung by a series of complications that have infuriated shareholders, among them a mixup over the name of its lead investor, and inaccurate claims made by Breslow about who had signed up for the deal. Three weeks ago, a Delaware court approved the restraining order, which Bolt has since tried to lift. “It's a return of the king for Ryan Breslow,” said Skadden attorney Cliff Gardner, representing BlackRock, Hedosophia and Untitled Ventures during Wednesday’s hearing, according to a Delaware Court of Chancery transcript obtained by Forbes. As previously reported by Forbes and others, the unorthodox deal would see Breslow reinstated as Bolt’s CEO and afford him a large number of benefits, such as a $2 million closing bonus, $80,000 per month for travel and security expenses and a preemptive right to purchase all shares issued in future rounds. “It should come as no surprise to anyone that I am concerned about an allegation that stockholders of a Delaware corporation are being subject to coercion.” The terms of the deal, which gave investors just days to buy into the pay-to-play round or see 70% of their shares effectively wiped out, were characterized by Vice Chancellor Nathan Cook as a “prisoner’s dilemma,” referring to the thought experiment where participants have a chance to either turn on each other or cooperate for a greater, shared prize. Accusing the deal of being coercive and harmful to shareholders, the three investors filed a restraining order to stop the round. The hearing last week was intended to provide Bolt an opportunity to respond. But the court transcript showed the company was unable to provide evidence that resolved the questions and allegations raised by the plaintiffs. “It should come as no surprise to anyone that I am concerned about an allegation that stockholders of a Delaware corporation are being subject to coercion,” Cook remarked. “And it's been two weeks since our last hearing, and there is no affidavit, no document that anyone can apparently point to that rebuts the allegation.” An attorney for Bolt called the investors’ claims “hyperventilation” and “indignation about the deal that Ryan Breslow is supposed to get out of this.” They also disputed the allegation that the deal, if approved by shareholders, would push through a broad release of claims against Breslow. When the judge pointed to a document that seemingly showed evidence of the release, the company’s attorneys said they planned to remove the “ambiguous” language. Got a tip for us? Contact reporters Sarah Emerson at semerson@forbes.com or 510-473-8820 on Signal, and Iain Martin at iain.martin@forbes.com. The contours of the confusing deal have continued to evolve. Last month, Forbes reported that a broker accidentally listed investment bank Silverbear Capital as the funding round’s lead investor, causing a flurry of shareholder confusion. The source of the error was Silverbear partner Brad Pamnani, who claimed to have used the wrong email address to sign a Bolt nondisclosure agreement. The broker, AMA Investment Group, told Forbes that it would be issuing corrected financial documents with the name of the actual lead investor, but according to last week’s hearing, no new paperwork has been provided — a fact the plaintiffs argued could prove troubling if they seek legal action against Pamnani, who is claiming to represent an unnamed Abu Dhabi-based fund, which could fall outside the Delaware court’s jurisdiction. “If I'm looking at this with the lightest touch…it would seem to me that whatever it is that's going on with Silverbear Capital is problematic from a disclosure standpoint,” said Judge Cook. Now, the plaintiffs are hoping to obtain testimony from Breslow, Bolt and some of its new backers. “We intend to depose Mr. Pamnani at a later stage and find out why he is confused about Silverbear's participation,” said Gardner, the plaintiffs’ attorney. Pamnani previously told Forbes that the error about Silverbear’s role was merely administrative. Bolt has since threatened the bank with legal action to hold it to the “binding term sheet” Pamnani signed. Silverbear partner Veronica Welch told Forbes she was unaware of the temporary restraining order, and said their team is currently working with Bolt “to come up with a solution that will enable us to all move forward together in a positive way.” Still, Bolt pushed for the injunction to be lifted, warning that the payments company was losing market share, and the lawsuit could stall the planned October launch of Bolt’s “super app.” But it struggled to explain the terms of the deal to the court, which include $250 million of “marketing credits” from an obscure venture fund with an influencer marketing startup. “I am beseeching you to identify somewhere in these documents that this deal actually works the way you are saying it works,” said Cook. In slides submitted to the court, the plaintiffs also detailed previously unreported elements of Bolt’s Series F round. For example, should the deal go through, Pamnani is set to receive compensation representing 250,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, while Bolt board member and gaming startup founder Michael Carter, who has known Breslow since his days at Stanford University, will receive options representing 1.8 million shares of Class A Common Stock. The shareholders continued to protest a settlement between Breslow and Bolt investor Activant Capital. Last year, Activant sued the founder over a $30 million loan he had secured with Bolt’s money and subsequently defaulted on. Both parties eventually agreed to a settlement that would cancel a commensurate number of Breslow’s shares as repayment, and would see Bolt repurchase Activant’s entire stake in the company. It also included a “true-up provision” that would hand Breslow a block of Bolt A or B shares worth $37.3 million if the startup raised at least $75 million in a new round by the end of the year. BlackRock and its co-plaintiffs objected to the agreement in July, accusing Breslow of using company funds to pay off his dissenters, and now argue the settlement should be halted under the restraining order. Last week, Breslow and Activant filed a joint appeal to allow the share cancellation and buyout to go through. “I want to pause and say those of us who are on the outside of the board, the plaintiffs, now it's just so utterly obvious this has been choreographed for all this time,” said Gardener. “When that settlement agreement came in — and I recall, I read that true-up provision, and I thought, boy, they must have this one cooking in the background.” Bolt and the investors are now fighting over the date of an upcoming preliminary injunction hearing next month. There will also be an expedited discovery process, wherein Bolt will be expected to produce internal documentation detailing the funding round. The investors pushed for a full trial next year but the company has asked the court to accept an earlier date “to accommodate sensitive business timing” issues. Bolt declined to comment, and Activant did not respond to a comment request.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: If your employer lets you work remotely one or more days a week, and you highly value that kind of flexibility, you probably didn’t love hearing last week that Amazon will soon require its corporate employees to return to the office five days a week. Or when AT&T last year announced it was consolidating offices and requiring managers to work on site at least three days a week — which meant some managers who lived near an office that was closing had to relocate or quit. Or even when JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, most of whose employees are already working in the office five days, publicly expressed displeasure last week that more government employees weren’t working on site in federal buildings, which he described as “empty,” according to various news reports. Whenever a big player publicly cracks the whip on requiring employees to be in the office full time, the worry is that other employers will follow suit. But for two key reasons, these kinds of public proclamations don’t signal a broader demise of remote work benefits. In the case of Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy’s memo announcing his new RTO mandate said all the usual things about wanting to strengthen in-person collaboration and company culture. But, importantly, Jassy also highlighted his desire to reduce the glut of managers hired in recent years, which had created more “layers,” including “a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward,” he said. To thin the managerial herd, Jassy called on senior leaders in the company “to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025.” Related article How can you prevent being laid off? You can’t. Here’s why Normally, that might involve manager layoffs. But Amazon said Wednesday that assertion is inaccurate. The effort to increase the ratio of individuals to managers is “not the same as eliminating roles and would not necessarily involve layoffs,” the company told CNN, noting that it has “no plans to reduce overall headcount as part of this decision.” But by imposing an unpopular mandate to be in the office five days a week, “middle managers who have been made wealthy enough will say ‘I’m leaving,’” said Chris Williams, a former vice president of human resources at Microsoft who is now a leadership consultant to C-suite executives. That saves a company the expense of having to provide severance packages, because people will leave voluntarily. Jassy’s risk is that too many managers could quit. “He will solve his near-term problem. But he will have a hard time convincing new hires to commute to downtown Seattle five days a week. So he may have a going-forward recruiting problem,” Williams said. If so, that may require Amazon to eventually — and quietly — back off enforcing the new five-days-a-week mandate to attract talent, he suggested. While an individual company may decide to backtrack on its remote work policies, the numbers suggest that’s not happening widely. Workplace consulting firm Gallup found in May that among full-time employees in remote-capable jobs, 53% work a hybrid schedule, 27% work exclusively remotely and 21% work on site. Those are roughly the same percentages reported in November 2022. As of August 31, job postings on Indeed.com that specify hybrid and remote work have dipped a half percentage point year over year. But that’s primarily because industries that typically have the most remote-capable jobs (e.g., software development) have been hiring less of late, according to Nick Bunker, Indeed’s North American economic research director. Related article Deciding what to do when your employer changes the rules on remote work A Conference Board survey of US workers, meanwhile, found that workplace flexibility is the most important element of total compensation beyond a competitive salary. It also found that HR leaders say hybrid work models help attract and retain talent. So it’s not surprising that Gallup also found that 64% of those working fully remote and 29% who work hybrid said they would be “extremely likely” to look for another job “if your employer decides not to offer opportunities for you to work remote some or all of the time long term.” Many CEOs seem to have gotten the memo. The Conference Board in January reported that just 4% of US CEOs said they planned to prioritize bringing people back to the office full time. Williams noted: “I have yet to talk to any enlightened CEO who honestly believes the only way to make a good [workplace] culture is face-to-face.” This story has been updated to include additional context.

Title: Skipping Coren Direbrew for the Halls of Origination

Time Published: 2024-09-25T14:15:40Z
Full Content:
Brewfest is back up in classic, with the Cataclysm level 85 rewards now part of the mix, so when the group got online on Sunday the thought was that we might pay a visit to our old friend Coren Direbrew for a bit of gearing up. Gearing up, as I mentioned in the previous post this week, was on our agenda. Camping the Horde trying to earn honor So we got all grouped up and I went to the dungeon finder and selected Coren Direbrew, who is in there as his own entry and… got told that Ula needed a level. Ula is not high enough level Looking at the group comp, she was not yet level 85 and still had a good six chiclets, 30% of a level, to go. We were not going to get that done quickly. The group this week Everything I saw online said you should be able to queue for Coren at level 84, but the DF was saying 85 was the minimum, and it makes the rules. So we went to Plan B and decided to just GO TO Blackrock Depths, where the Grim Guzzler is located, to visit Coren Direbrew in person. A couple of flew out to Blackrock Mountain, got to the summoning stone, then summoned the remainder, and then the group began the trot down to Blackrock Depths, a location we visited no fewer than a dozen times during vanilla. Once we got in, we had to figure out how to get to the Grim Guzzler. There was a Dark Iron transport, a “screw house” in the vernacular of our group, which offered a couple of options which corresponded to the new, broken into nice bite sized adventures, that is the reality of BRD in the era of Cataclsym, neither of which got us where we needed to go. One was just past the Grim Guzzler, but the door was locked and nobody had the key, and the other was down a different path that wouldn’t help us. So we just went old school and ran to the bar. And when we got there, no Coren Direbrew was there to be seen. I mean, the Tauren Chieften’s band kit was still there, the kegs were still there, we were in the right location within BRD, just not where Coren was. Potshot remembered that last time around we got a little device that would summon a screw house and send us to Coren. I had one back in the bank, so UIa put up a portal to Ironforge so I could go get it, then there was a ritual of summoning by Liftkit to return me to the instance. I activated the control, a screw house appeared, and it deposited us about ten feet across the room. Such a distance! It seems that Coren now exists in his own instance than can only be reached via the Dungeon Finder and we were not going to get to him. His upgrades would have to wait. So we said screw it and I queued us up for the Halls or Origination, which was the next instance on our Cataclysm list. Off we went. Kids in the Hall! Seven bosses! It was going to be an event! But at least the in-game dungeon guide gives you a scorecard so you can be sure to collect them all. Today’s boss lineup Into the instance the map only showed two bosses, so we were clearly going to be moving around. The opening map of the instance Fortunately, the path was pretty clear to the first boss. We struggled a little bit with the trash mob groups after two weeks away, but that was sufficient warm up to get us to Temple Guardian Anhuur. Anhuur, the first boss on the list The in-game guide was good enough to give us some useful tips on the fight mechanics… specifically, that twice during the fight Anhuur will put up a barrier that will make him invulnerable and to get past that somebody has to run downstairs and trip two switches before the fight can resume. The switches, to left and right, marked by Potshot There are some snakes down there… non-elite… that we tried to clear, but somebody thought about that dodge and they respawn quickly. Still, it seemed doable. Ula took one switch, Liftkit the other, and off we went. And it seemed to work. When Anhuur is invulnerable he also doesn’t deal out much damage, so we had time. The fight went by quickly enough and soon it was one boss down. Anhuur down in 2 minutes and 52 seconds Among other things, the Deadly Boss Mods addon gives you a fight timer. I don’t know that we set any records, but I’ll record the times for posterity. As for drops, he had a nice mail item, and nobody in our group wears mail, so one for Ula to disenchant. Past Anhuur we hit that big round room on the map, which is an elevator. However, it wasn’t letting us go anywhere, so we went to the left towards the Vault of Lights on the map where we ran into Bann Bronzebeard at the door to the area. Oh, hey Brann… you going to open that for us? He did oblige and open it and gave us a song and dance about getting to the door at the far side, which meant eliminating a mini boss in each of the four along the way, while fending off roving groups or quickly respawning troggs. The troggs turned out to be, if not soap bubbles, then at least not really as elite as their designations otherwise indicated. And the mini bosses were not so bad either. On eliminating the last one the door at the far end opened and Anraphet stepped out, banished the troggs, and then waited for us to make out move. Anraphet awaits Having done well reading up on the first boss we got a little deep into trying to decipher how to do every fight going forward… though, in the end, save for an odd mechanic here and there, the solution tended to be “more DPS” to just finish things. And so went Anraphet, who at least dropped something useful. Modest breastplate upgrade for Fergorin We then followed Brann into the room where… he didn’t do much. So Brann… you brought us all here… With no buttons to press or further dialog to deal with, we went back the way we came, back to the elevator. However, I looked at the boss list and it seemed like we skipped somebody. So we went down the hallway that kind of fades on the map and found Earthrager Ptah. Ptah was waiting for us There are some camels you can ride to get to him, however when you dismount them they die, which was a bit disturbing. Ptah’s guide said that mid-fight he would summon some adds that we would need to defeat before the fight could resume… so we did. We managed to wrap him up in just under two minutes. Ptah done in 1 minute and 59 seconds Ptah did a nice staff that our two casters did a need-off to get. Ptah’s parting gift Ula won the roll and walked away with a shiny new staff. That done it was back to the elevator which now offered us an option to go to the second floor, which offered us a selection of bosses. Second floor, four ways Now, if I had been paying close attention to the boss list in the guide we would have gone magic, life, destruction, then radiance. But we happened to be facing north so we went to the first boss we saw, Rajh the Construct of the Sun, which I guess applies to “radiance” but also it would be nice if they would use the same terminology across the board. Anyway, him. Welcome to the sun… or Radiance… or Rajh He had several ominous sounding attacks and a whole portion of the fight where he would deliver unavoidable AOE but also take double damage and we were working out how to heal through it and making sure everybody had potions and such. And then the fight happened, he got to that part and I started just shouting “More DPS!” (DOTs being irrelevant) and then he was dead. Rajh laid out before us That also triggered the achievement for the instance because we did the last boss first. Are we there yet? That done, we went after the other three. Eschewing any order, we went for destruction next, facing Setesh. Setesh has a nice style The trash before him caused us to wipe. It turns out that they lay down gunk that heals them and damages you, so you need to kite them around. Instead I just sat there as we burned through all of Fergorin’s mana, all my cool downs, and whatever else we had before we were all dead. Ula, last alive, started to kite them and made some progress, which was the lightbulb moment. Once revived and restored… that guild perk ress is very handy… Liftkit banished one of the trash mobs and I kited the other around and they were dead in about a minute. It helps to do the right thing. Setesh himself had a whole routine where you can’t tank him, he just summons adds and you’re supposed to take them down, and crystals the DPS are supposed to stand in to boost their damage, and probably something else I am forgetting. It was all a distraction. We got deep into the fight and the adds were getting out of control and I called to just kill him while I tried to collect all the adds… and that did it. Setech also dropped a nice healer mace for Fergorin. Scepter for Fergorin Two down. Magic was up next, with Isiset. We had a bit of trouble with her trash too, but I managed to step out of the beam of death that was killing me before I caused another wipe. Isiset and the house of magic Isiset has a mechanic where twice during the fight she splits up into her three abilities the first time, and the ability you kill is removed from the fight while the other two get a buff. When that hit I chose the ability where she summons adds, which seemed like the best call. So no adds to worry about. I don’t even remember which ability I chose on the second round I was so happy to not deal with adds. And, we finished her off. That left us with Ammunae, the construct of life. Ammunae awaits us Another fight with another gimmick, this time pods you needed to kill lest they become elite adds. More adds. Why does it always have to be adds? Anyway, we did Ammunae like the Tide pod challenge and that was that. We had finished it off The group post instance I later went back and looked at the blog post from our run at the instance back in 2014 and… we did almost exactly the same thing. We even wiped on the same trash mobs and did the last boss first. I guess we are predictable. Done with the instance we asked Ula for a portal to Stormwind, so she wound up and… disappeared. Ula now missing from the scene Out of practice for a couple of weeks, she mixed up the left click, right click thing for portals versus teleports. Liftkit then used the Dungeon Finder to leave the instance… and ended up back in Blackrock Depths which is where we were when we queued for the dungeon. Fergorin, Kharageenan, and I decided to just hearthstone back to Dalaran… because of course our stones are still set there. Time to hearth on out That leaves us with just the Lost City of Tol’vir on the list of normal mode dungeons to complete. Of course, there is still Coren Direbrew. Ula should be 85 by the next time we get together. Halls of Origination is the reason why I stopped queuing for random dungeons –normal or heroic– in Retail. I got into my first HoO run, zoned in, and told people there that this was my first time there, and… I was ignored. People just ran ahead and did the instance, assuming that everybody knew what was supposed to be done, and I basically ran around like a chicken with my head cut off trying to just do damage where I could. To this day I still don’t know how that instance is supposed to work. I guess I should feel grateful that I wasn’t kicked and that the instance is marked “completed” somewhere, but I certainly don’t feel like I actually participated in the dungeon. That was when I decided to stop queuing for random instances and either stick to the ones I knew or just stop running PvE group content entirely. So kudos to you and your group for completing that instance and figuring it out. LikeLike I am just amused that we made all the same mistakes as we did a decade back. Some might suggest that I should read the old posts BEFORE we do an instance again, but where is the fun in that? LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: On the Heels of Inflation, Why Experts Expect Gold Prices Will Climb to Record Highs in 2025

September 25, 2024 10:15 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - Gold prices are forecast to climb to record highs in the coming year. The price of gold has soared to new heights this year and is positioned to climb into early 2025, rising to new record highs, according to Goldman Sachs Research. The precious metal has increased more than 20% this year, peaking at a record of more than $2,500 per troy ounce. Goldman Sachs Research forecasts the price will reach $2,700 by early next year, buoyed by interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and gold purchases by emerging market central banks. The metal could get an additional boost if the US imposes new financial sanctions or if concerns mount about the US debt burden. They see that Gold prices are forecast to climb to record high. Goldman Sachs says that: “Gold is our strategists’ preferred near-term long (the commodity they most expect to go up in the short term), and it’s also their preferred hedge against geopolitical and financial risks. In this softer cyclical environment, gold stands out as the commodity where we have the highest confidence in near-term upside,” Goldman Sachs Research strategists Samantha Dart and Lina Thomas write. Active Mining Companies in the markets today include Asia Broadband Inc. (OTCPK: AABB), Equinox Gold Corp. (NYSE American: EQX), Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE: KGC), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD), IAMGOLD Corporation (NYSE: IAG). In an additional article, Goldman Sachs added: “The yellow metal typically only guards against very high inflation and large inflation surprises caused by losses in central bank credibility and geopolitical supply shocks. Gold usually didn’t perform well in response to positive demand shocks when the central bank responded swiftly by hiking rates. Gold emerged as the best commodity to serve as a potential hedge against inflation and geo-political risks. Goldman Sachs Research’s base case is that gold appreciates to $2,700/troy ounce by year-end, an increase of about 16%, on solid demand from central banks in emerging markets and from Asian households. Gold could help shield against potential stock market drops if a trade war erupts, and it has upside if concerns mount about the US debt load or if the Fed is subordinated by a new administration.” Asia Broadband Inc. (OTCPK: AABB) Gold Production Continues Upward Trend For Third Quarter, As Ore Stockpile Processing Plant Advances Towards Completion - Asia Broadband Inc. (“AABB” or the “Company) is pleased to announce that the Company’s operations for the 3rd quarter ending September 30, 2024, will be completed next week and production levels have already surpassed the second quarter. The Company has exceeded its production and gross profit levels achieved in both the 1st and 2nd consecutive record quarters this year. Gold production more than doubled in the 1st quarter of 2024, in comparison to the 4th quarter of 2023, due to higher grade selection, recovery efficiencies and increased daily throughput levels. Additionally, the economies of scale from higher productions levels reduced production costs and added to the bottom-line gross profit, which has continued in an upward trend over the last three quarters. The elevated operational strategies and efficiencies of the AABB mining team continued in the 3rd quarter and has firmly established the foundation for the high production levels to follow the completion of the Company’s processing plant. The new facility is currently under construction in Etzatlan, Mexico, and its capacity will be primarily dedicated to processing the estimated $1 billion dollar ore value of the Company’s exclusive rights surface stockpile. AABB continues to develop the processing plant and will release updates as progress milestones are reached. The Company will release a processing plant project update in October. “The elevation of our production processes by the mining operations team in all three quarters of this year will have a multiplier effect with increased production levels. We are eagerly awaiting to extend this expertise to our massive ore stockpile processing when the new plant is complete. This will take us to a much higher level than we have ever reached before,” expressed Chris Torres, the Company President and CEO. AABB continues to implement its mining property acquisition strategy to optimize development capital utilization by focusing operations in regions of Mexico where AABB has a comparative advantage of development resources and expertise readily available for rapid expansion and duplication of the Company’s previous gold production success. CONTINUED… Read this full release for Asia Broadband at: https://www.financialnewsmedia.com/news-aabb/ Other recent developments in the mining industry include: Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD) recently said it is projecting a 30% growth in the production of gold-equivalent ounces from its existing assets by the end of this decade while it continues to unlock the value embedded in its portfolio, says president and chief executive Mark Bristow. Speaking at the Gold Forum Americas, Bristow said while Barrick was alert to potentially value-accretive opportunities generated by the consolidation of the industry, it had the rare luxury of doing so from an asset base that would support organic growth well into the future. “Five years ago, we set out to build a sustainably profitable gold and copper business focused on world-class assets. We did not have to buy them at a premium: they were embedded in the merged portfolio of Barrick and Randgold and we just had to unlock their value,” he said. Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE: KGC) recently provided an update on the Great Bear project (the “Project”), located in Red Lake, Ontario, Canada. Kinross has completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the Great Bear project which supports the Company’s acquisition thesis of a top tier high-margin operation in a stable jurisdiction with strong infrastructure. Based on mineral resources drilled to date, the PEA outlines a high-grade combined open pit and underground mine with an initial planned mine life of approximately 12 years and production cost of sales of $594 per ounce. The Project is expected to produce over 500,000 ounces per year at an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of approximately $800 per ounce during the first 8 years through a conventional, modest capital 10,000 tonne per day (tpd) mill. Kinross has also released an updated mineral resource estimate increasing the inferred resource estimate by 568koz. to 3.884 Moz. which is in addition to the existing M&I resource estimate of 2.738 Moz. The mineral resource estimate and PEA for the Great Bear project are available here. Equinox Gold Corp. (NYSE American: EQX) recently announced an updated Mineral Resource Estimate ("MRE") for its 100% owned, exploration-stage Hasaga Property ("Hasaga" or the "Property") in Red Lake, Ontario. "Hasaga is located in the Red Lake Gold District of northwestern Ontario, which is renowned for its high gold grades and prolific historical gold production. This updated Mineral Resource Estimate focuses on the high-grade nature of the gold mineralization and is a departure from the previous bulk-tonnage approach," stated Scott Heffernan, EVP Exploration of Equinox Gold. "As expected, the updated Mineral Resource Estimate contains fewer gold ounces but at significantly higher average gold grades. "Further, the main zones of gold mineralization included in the updated Mineral Resource Estimate remain open, with numerous historical gold intersections defining drill-ready targets highlighting the potential for resource growth and new discoveries." IAMGOLD Corporation (NYSE: IAG) recently announced that the Côté Gold Mine ("Côté Gold" or "Côté") has reached commercial production. Côté Gold is located in Ontario, Canada and is operated as a joint venture between IAMGOLD, as the operator, and Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd. ("Sumitomo"). Commercial production is defined as the achievement of reaching a minimum of 30 consecutive days of operations during which the mill operated at an average of 60% of nameplate throughput of 36,000 tpd. "I would like to commend our teams at Côté Gold who have come together to achieve another great milestone as we progress and ramp up what we believe will be one of Canada's largest gold mines and a model for modern mining in Canada," said Renaud Adams, President and Chief Executive Officer of IAMGOLD. "Since achieving the first pour of gold on March 31, 2024, our teams have spent the last four months methodically and iteratively testing and ramping up all facets of the mine. This process has required remarkable commitment, ingenuity and teamwork to bring all the systems online together to achieve this milestone."

Title: On human nanoscale synaptome: Morphology modeling and storage estimation
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310156
Time Published: 2024-09-25T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
One of the key challenges in neuroscience is to generate the human nanoscale connectome which requires comprehensive knowledge of synaptome forming the neural microcircuits. The synaptic architecture determines limits of individual mental capacity and provides the framework for understanding neurologic disorders. Here, I address morphology modeling and storage estimation for the human synaptome at the nanoscale. A synapse is defined as a pair of pairs [(presynaptic_neuron),(presynaptic_axonal_terminal);(postsynaptic_neuron),(postsynaptic_dendritic_terminal)]. Center coordinates, radius, and identifier characterize a dendritic or axonal terminal. A synapse comprises topology with the paired neuron and terminal identifiers, location with terminal coordinates, and geometry with terminal radii. The storage required for the synaptome depends on the number of synapses and storage necessary for a single synapse determined by a synaptic model. I introduce three synaptic models: topologic with topology, point with topology and location, and geometric with topology, location, and geometry. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the numbers of neurons and synapses reported in the literature, four cases of neurons (30;86;100;138 billion) and three cases of synapses per neuron (1,000;10,000;30,000) are considered with three full and simplified (to reduce storage) synaptic models resulting in total 72 cases of storage estimation. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the entire human brain requires from 0.21(0.14) petabytes (PB) to 28.98(18.63) PB for the topologic model, from 0.57(0.32) PB to 78.66(43.47) PB for the point model, and from 0.69(0.38) PB to 95.22(51.75) PB for the geometric model. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the cortex needs from 86.80(55.80) TB to 2.60(1.67) PB for the topologic model, from 235.60(130.02) TB to 7.07(3.91) PB for the point model, and from 285.20(155.00) TB to 8.56(4.65) PB for the geometric model. The topologic model is sufficient to compute the connectome’s topology, but it is still too big to be stored on today’s top supercomputers related to neuroscience. Frontier, the world’s most powerful supercomputer for 86 billion neurons can handle the nanoscale synaptome in the range of 1,000–10,000 synapses per neuron. To my best knowledge, this is the first big data work attempting to provide storage estimation for the human nanoscale synaptome.

The human brain is an enormously complex, multi-scale, and multi-level structure operating in space and time as well as generating molecular, cellular, and neuronal phenomena [1]. Understanding its structure, function, and dysfunction is a huge scientific challenge, a critical social need, and a great market opportunity. While attempting to solve emerging problems, neuroscience progresses tremendously producing big data [2] whose processing requires high-performance computing [3]. The challenges emerge in the acquisition, processing, modeling, interpretation, storage, and use of neurodata; here we address modeling and storage. The knowledge of connectome is essential for understanding how neural microcircuits encode information and how the brain works in health and disease [4]. The full nanoscale connectomes have only been completed for nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C.elegans) [5], larva Ciona intestinalis [6], and Drosophila [7]. These animals have very small brains; namely, Ciona intestinalis 177 neurons and about 6,600 connections, C.elegans 302 neurons (a constant number) and about 7,000 connections, and Drosophila about 100–130 thousand neurons and millions of connections. The human connectome has been developed at the macroscale by providing anatomical and functional connectivity [8]. The full human nanoscale connectome, however, has not yet been created. The most critical obstacles in obtaining it are the prohibitively long overall time necessary to acquire data and the computing resources required for storing and processing these big data [2,3,9]. For instance, to image the whole human brain would require an estimated 17 million years [9] by applying the same brain imaging protocol as was employed for Drosophila [7]. In addition, it is assessed that the complete reconstruction of 1 mm3 of the cortex would require 10,000 man-years [10] and cost above $100 million [4]. Owing to the progress in imaging, the acquisition time constantly decreases. In particular, synchrotron X-ray tomography [11] is a promising imaging modality able to decrease the whole human brain acquisition time at the sub-cellular level to a few years [12] or even less. At present, for instance, by employing phase-contrast synchrotron tomography, whole brain imaging was performed in about 16 hours at a 25 μm spatial resolution with 16-bit voxels [13]. This level of spatial resolution enables imaging the neuronal cell bodies, however, it still is insufficient to reveal the complete neurons with their dendrites and axons as well as the synapses that functionally connect neurons. The creation of the nanoscale human connectome requires the segmentation of all neurons and the reconstruction of all neuronal microcircuits forming it, each microcircuit considered a sequence of synapses, so consequently comprehensive knowledge of synaptome, i.e., the complete set of all synapses in the brain. The synaptic architecture determines the limits of individual mental capacity and provides the framework for understanding neurologic disorders [14]. The goal of this work is to 1) formulate three (topology-, location-, and geometry-related) morphological models of the human synaptome at the nanoscale along with their simplified versions to reduce storage and 2) estimate storage requirements for these models. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the numbers of neurons and synapses reported in the literature, four cases of the total number of neurons in the brain (30;86;100; and 138 billion) and three cases of the number of synapses per neuron (1,000;10,000; and 30,000) are considered with three full and the corresponding simplified synaptic models resulting in total 72 cases of storage estimation. To my best knowledge, this is the first big data work providing the storage requirement estimation for the human nanoscale synaptome. The storage required for the synaptome can be calculated as (1) The number of synapses can be approximated by half of the product of the average number of neurons by the average number of synapses per neuron (a pair of the connected neurons form a synapse by the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, so to avoid duplication in synapse counting half of the product shall be taken) The average number of neurons in the human brain and the average number of synapses per neuron can be obtained from abundant literature studies whereas the storage required for a single synapse is determined from the synaptic morphology model considered below. The exact numbers of neurons and synapses in the human brain are challenging to precisely determine due to the brain’s complexity and variability and a brief, nearly 150-year, history of cell counting in human brains along with types of counting methods are presented by von Barthel [15]. Because of large biological variability among individual human brains and different brain regions as well as diverse cell counting methods employed, the number of neurons in the human brain and its parts reported in various studies highly ranges. For instance, in an average brain, a normal biological variation in the number of neocortical neurons occurs by a factor more than two [15]. Many textbooks, original articles, and reviews have affirmed that the total number of neurons in the human brain is one hundred billion [16–24]. This affirmation is also present in the textbook by Kandel et al. [18] which is a commonly used textbook in neuroscience (and even praised as the “bible of neuroscience” [15]) authored by a Nobel Prize laureate in physiology or medicine 2000. This textbook knowledge has been challenged by more robust methods for neuron number counting providing an estimate of 86.1 billion neurons [25]. In some other sources, the number of neurons in the entire human brain was estimated at 30 billion [26], 70–80 billion [27], 85 billion [28], 67–86 billion [29], and 75–125 billion [30]. The number of neurons in the cerebral cortex reported in various studies ranges from 2.6 billion [31] to 32 billion [32]. A majority of studies estimate this number between 10–20 billion neurons including 14 billion [33],10–19 billion [34], 18.8 billion [35], 12.4 billion [25], and 12.7 billion [29]. In the cerebellar cortex Haug estimated about 50 billion neurons [27] and Williams and Herrup 65–70 billion neurons [28], whereas Andersen et al. estimated 102 billion neurons in the human cerebellum (105 billion cells including 3 billion glial cells) [36]. Several studies imply that the range of 50–70 billion cerebellar neurons is the most credible, including 54 billion [29] and 69 billion [25]. The number of neurons together in the brainstem, striatum, and diencephalon is approximately 700 million [25]. The above studies are summarized in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.t001 Many studies revealed that synapses are complex and diverse [37]. Moreover, their number can vary between individuals and change in response to learning and experience. Therefore, any estimates of their number should also be taken as an approximation. The number of synapses per neuron is also highly variable. Kandel et al. estimate that there are around 1014 (100 trillion) synapses in the average adult human brain [18] (meaning 1,000 synapses per neuron). Ref. [38] reports that the total number of synapses in the human neocortex is approximately 0.15×1015 (0.15 quadrillion). According to a reference book [39], the average neuron has 1,000 synapses with other neurons. Ten thousand connections per neuron are reported in [23]. Some sources estimate that a single neuron can have between 1,000–15,000 synaptic connections [24,40]. Defelipe demonstrated that the number of synapses per neuron is also cortical layer-dependent and the study of the synaptic profiles within cubes of cortical tissue of 50 μm wide by 50 μm thick revealed that for 158 neurons and 4,483,400 synapses examined in 6 cortical layers, the average number of synapses per neuron was 29,642 (100,042 in layer I (for 5 neurons only), 17,046 in layer II, 37,066 in layer IIIa, 56,521 in layer IIIb, 15,989 in layer IV, 29,965 in layer V, and 28,224 in layer VI) [41]. Hence, for the storage estimation, we take 3 values, 1,000, 10,000, and 30,000 synapses per neuron. To describe neuronal morphology at the nanoscale a dedicated nano neuronal format nN has been introduced [42] and accommodated here to model the synaptome. Let us assume that the whole brain has been imaged and all its neurons are already processed, and their synaptic axonal and dendritic terminals (also termed elements or membranes) are extracted and located in some Cartesian coordinate system. Let the terminal morphology be characterized by the coordinates of its center, radius, and identifier. Hence, the morphology of a dendritic terminal is described as follows Dendritic terminal identifier (D) Dendritic terminal coordinates (x,y,z) Dendritic terminal radius (r) The morphology of an axonal terminal is described in the following way Axonal terminal identifier (A) Axonal terminal coordinates (x,y,z) Axonal terminal radius (r) Consider two neurons forming a synapse meaning the following pair of pairs [(presynaptic neuron),(presynaptic axonal terminal);(postsynaptic neuron),(postsynaptic dendritic terminal)]. Let i and j be a presynaptic neuron and the postsynaptic neuron with identifiers Ni and Nj, and m and n the axonal terminal Aim and the dendritic terminal Djn of neurons i and j, respectively. Then, the synapse between the neurons i and j is defined as a pair of quadruples [Ni,Aim,(xim,yim,zim),rim;Nj,Djn,(xjn,yjn,zjn),rjn]. A synapse has three components, topology (the neuron and terminal identifiers), location (the coordinates of the terminal centers), and geometry (the terminal radii by approximating the fundi of the terminals with the circular shape), Fig 1. The complete synaptome is defined as a set of all the synapses {[Ni,Aim,(xim,yim,zim),rim;Nj,Djn,(xjn,yjn,zjn),rjn]} for all the presynaptic and the corresponding postsynaptic neurons. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.g001 I consider three synaptic morphology models with diverse content and potential applications, namely, (1) the topologic model with topology, (2) the point model with topology and location, and (3) the geometric model with topology, location, and geometry. The topologic model encapsulates the topology of all presynaptic neurons along with the topology of the corresponding postsynaptic neurons, i.e., {(presynaptic topology);(postsynaptic topology)}. The point model characterizes the topology and location of all presynaptic neurons and the corresponding postsynaptic neurons, i.e., {(presynaptic topology and location);(postsynaptic topology and location)}. The geometric model describes the topology, location, and geometry of all presynaptic neurons and the corresponding postsynaptic neurons, i.e., {(presynaptic topology, location, and geometry);(postsynaptic topology, location, and geometry)}. For the four considered cases of the number of neurons i.e. 30, 86, 100, and 138 billion, we get {3 1010, 86 1010, 1011, 1.38 1011} = {234.80, 236.32, 236.54, 237.01}. Hence, to store the neuron’s unique identifier out of other 30, 86, 100, or 138 billion neurons, 5 bytes (B) are needed in any of these four cases. For the three considered cases of the number of synapses per neuron, i.e., 1,000, 10,000, 30,000, we get {103, 104, 3 104} = {29.97, 213.29, 214.87}. Hence, for a given neuron to store its terminal’s unique identifier out of other 1,000, 10,000, or 30,000 terminals, 2 B are required in any of these three cases. The terminal coordinates are voxel resolution and synapse type dependent. There are two types of synapses, chemical with the synaptic gap (cleft) of 20-30/20-40 nm [43,44] and electrical with the 2–4 nm gap [43]. To distinguish the synapses, the acquisition data shall be sampled sufficiently dense and according to the Nyquist sampling theorem, the spatial sampling resolution shall be no lower than 10 nm to handle chemical synapses and 1 nm for the electrical synapses. To distinguish values at the levels of 10 nm and 1 nm spatial resolutions, the required ranges of values shall be 108 (226.6) for the 10 nm resolution and 109 (229.9) for the 1 nm resolution. Hence, 4 B are needed to store a terminal single coordinate value for each of the 10 nm and 1 nm voxel resolutions. To store a terminal location with 3 coordinates,12 B of storage are required. To store a terminal radius, 1 number meaning 4 B are needed. Hence, a single synapse storage determined by the synaptic model as a pair of (neuron, terminal) pairs requires (3) These values, because of an enormous number of synapses, will result in huge storage requirements so three simplifications are proposed to the synaptic model. First, in the full synaptic model for a given presynaptic neuron with identifier Ni its all presynaptic terminals Tim (each including the identifier, coordinates, and radius) are represented as a sequence of {[Ni,Ti1] … [Ni,Tim] … [Ni,TiM]}, where iM is the number of presynaptic terminals in neuron Ni. Since the neuron identifier is the same for all its presynaptic terminals, this sequence can be expressed as (Ni,{Tim}), m = 1 … iM. The number of presynaptic terminals is estimated as follows. Every presynaptic terminal (the presynaptic neuron’s output) has its corresponding postsynaptic terminal (the postsynaptic neuron’s input) so, consequently, the number of all neuronal inputs equals the number of all neuronal outputs. Therefore, on average we can assume that in an average neuron, half of its terminals are presynaptic and the other half postsynaptic. As the storage required for the presynaptic neuron’s terminals is for the considered cases at least three orders higher than that for the presynaptic neuron’s identifier, so the latter can be neglected. Second, the two sets of coordinates for the corresponding presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals can be approximated by a single set of coordinates with their mean value. Similarly, the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminal radii can be approximated by their mean value. Hence, the single synapse storage requirements for the simplified synapse model are the following (4) To estimate the storage required for the human synaptome Eq 2 is employed, where the single synapse storage for the full version of the synaptic model is determined by relationship (3) and for the simplified version of the synaptic model by relationship (4), the numbers of neurons in the average adult human brain and its parts are given in Table 1, and the numbers of synapses per neuron are provided in Section 2.3. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the numbers of neurons and synapses reported in numerous sources, four cases of neurons and three cases of synapses per neuron are considered. Additionally, taking into account three synaptic models with full and simplified versions, in total 72 cases providing the storage required for the synaptome are estimated. For 100 billion neurons each on average with 10 thousand synapses 0.5 x 14 x 1011 x 104 = 7 x 1015 = 7 petabyte (PB) storage is required for the full topologic model. The full point and geometric models need 19 PB and 23 PB, respectively. The simplified models require 4.5 PB, 10.5 PB, and 12.5 PB for the topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. For 86 billion neurons each on average with 10 thousand synapses these storage requirements reduce to 6.02 (3.87) PB, 16.34 (9.03) PB, and 19.78 (10.75) PB for the full (simplified) topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. For 86 billion neurons each on average with one thousand synapses the storage requirements are 0.6 (0.39) PB, 1.63 (0.9.) PB, and 1.98 (1.08) PB for the full (simplified) topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. The storage requirements for all 72 cases are given in Table 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.t002 Similarly, by applying relationships (2)-(4) and Table 1, storage requirements for different parts of the brain can be estimated. Then, Table 3 provides the storage required for the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem/striatum/diencephalon for the case of 86 billion neurons in the entire brain (for consistency all the numbers are from the same source [25]) estimated for the full and simplified topologic, point, and geometric synaptic models. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.t003 The same approach can, in general, be employed to estimate the data required for small brains, however, Eqs (3)–(4) are not directly applicable because the size of the synapse identifier is neuron and synapse number dependent. Let us estimate storage requirements for C.elegans [5]. To distinguish 7 x 103 = 212.77 synapses, 2B are required for the synapse identifier (with no need to apply the neuron identifier). Then, the single synapse storage needs 4 (2x2) B for the topologic model, 28 (2x2 + 2x3x4) B for the point model, and 36 (2x2 + 2x3x4+ 2x4) B for the geometric model. Hence, the full synaptic model of C.elegans with about 7,000 synapses requires around 28 KB for the topologic model, 196 KB for the point model, and 252 KB for the geometric model. For the simplified synaptic model, the single synapse storage needs 2 (1x2) B for the topologic model, 14 (1x2 + 1x3x4) B for the point model, and 18 (1x2 + 1x3x4+ 1x4) B for the geometric model. Therefore, the simplified synaptic model requires about 14 KB for the topologic model, 98 KB for the point model, and 126 KB for the geometric model. Let us estimate storage requirements for Drosophila. Scheffer et al. report that Drosophila has about 100,000 neurons and that the central hemibrain consists of approximately 25,000 neurons and around 20 million chemical synapses [45]. To estimate the storage required for Drosophila I use the information about the data size of the FlyWire dataset which is an electron microscopy reconstruction of the complete brain of an adult female Drosophila with about 130 thousand neurons and 32 million synapses representing the complete Drosophila brain [46–49]. Therefore, to distinguish 32 x 106 = 224.93 synapses, 4B are required for the synapse identifier. Then, the single synapse storage needs 8 (2x4) B for the topologic model, 32 (2x4 + 2x3x4) B for the point model, and 40 (2x4 + 2x3x4+ 2x4) B for the geometric model. Hence, the full synaptic model of Drosophila with 32 million synapses requires 256 MB for the topologic model, 1,024 MB for the point model, and 1,280 MB for the geometric model. For the simplified synaptic model, the single synapse storage needs 4 (1x4) B for the topologic model, 16 (1x4 + 1x3x4) B for the point model, and 20 (1x4 + 1x3x4+ 1x4) B for the geometric model. Therefore, the simplified synaptic model requires 128 MB for the topologic model, 512 MB for the point model, and 640 MB for the geometric model. The comparison of storage required for C.elegans, Drosophila, and human (for the case of 86 billion neurons in the entire brain and 1,000 synapses per neuron) estimated for the full and simplified topologic, point, and geometric synaptic models is presented in Table 4. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.t004 To evaluate the proposed method, the first large, nanoscale human brain tissue sample of a 1 mm3 [50] is employed here since a volumetric image dataset of the entire human brain at the nanoscale has not yet been acquired. The sample was surgically acquired from the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex, stained, embedded in resin, cut into ~30 nm thick sections, and scanned using electron microscopy. The resulting volume comprises 50,000 cells, hundreds of millions of neurites, and 150 million synapses. In [51] this volume was additionally annotated such that each neuron object had 19 attributes and each synapse object had seven attributes (synapse ID, synapse type, presynaptic site considered as an object, postsynaptic partner considered as an object, location, bounding box, and layer). To store the annotated properties of the synapses along with those of the neurons and layers, nearly 27 GB of storage was required. In our synaptic model, a synapse is characterized by identifier, location, and size whereas in [51] a synapse is annotated with seven attributes, so to enable a fairer comparison the geometric model is extended with 14 additional numbers, 12 for the four coordinates of a rectangular bounding box and one for each of synapse type and layer. Hence, the extended geometric model requires 46 + 14 x 4 = 102 B. This storage still may be underestimation, as here I consider the presynaptic and postsynaptic sites to be represented by indexes whereas in [51] they are represented as objects. The extended geometric model for 150 million synapses requires 102 x 150 x 106 = 15,300 x 106 = 15.3 GB. Taking into account that this extended geometric model is likely underestimation and that nearly 27 GB cited in [51] is needed not only for the synapses but also for the annotated cells and hundreds of millions of neurites, these two amounts of storage are roughly comparable. One of the fundamental challenges in neuroscience is to generate the human nanoscale connectome. The key groups of challenges are data acquisition and computing. The acquisition produces big data and requires an enormous amount of time as already mentioned in the introduction. For very small brains, such as for the Drosophila brain, the acquired dataset can cover the entire adult brain, while in mammals the largest datasets include only a tiny fraction of a brain. For instance, a complete adult Drosophila brain was imaged with electron microscopy resulting in 7,050 40 nm thin sections forming a dataset of about 106 TB [46]. Regarding mammals, a tissue sample of the mouse lateral geniculate body having 67 million cubic microns of 400 x 600 x 280 resolution with about 100 trillion voxels yielded a dataset of about 100 TB [52]. A sample of 1 mm3 of mouse neocortex with 26,500 electron microscopy ultrathin sections with 4 nm/pixel resolution yielded a dataset of more than 2 petabytes [53]. Hence, a sample of 500 mm3 would have required a 1 exabyte storage. This dataset was continuously imaged across five microscopes for almost 6 months, each producing a daily throughput of 3.6 TB [53]. Not only acquisition but also validation is time consuming. To validate a hemibrain center of Drosophila assuming a rate of 1000 connections annotated per trained person, per day, would have taken more than 230 working years [45]. The first large nanoscale human brain tissue sample with 5,292 slices of 33 nm average thickness and 4 x4 nm2 pixels yielded a volume of approximately 2.1 PB [50]. The key computational challenges to achieve this goal are big data [2] and high-performance computing [3]. Although suitable data enabling the computation of the entire human connectome at the nanoscale have not been acquired yet, some of the computational challenges have already been addressed earlier [42,54,55]. I have previously formulated a dedicated nano neuronal data file format to describe neuron morphology at the nanoscale [42], estimated storage requirements to keep the volumetric and four geometric neuronal models (straight wireframe, enhanced wireframe, straight polygonal, and enhanced polygonal) [54], estimated high performance computing requirements for morphology modeling of the entire human brain at the nanoscale [55], and designed a nanoscale human brain atlas enabling the exploration of the brain model at the nanoscale [42]. As the connectome can be computed from the synaptome, toward the synaptome calculation I here present three morphologic models of the human nanoscale synaptome and quantitatively estimate the data bigness for storing them. These synaptome models are topologic, point, and geometric. Having the synaptome determined, any neuronal microcircuit is formed as a sequence of synapses whereas all the microcircuits, in turn, constitute the connectome. Any synaptic model introduced here enables the calculation of the connectome. The numbers of neurons and synapses in the human brain and its parts are highly variable and widely range in numerous studies reported; therefore, here I consider four cases of the total number of neurons in the entire brain including the minimum and maximum, and three cases of synapses per neuron in addition to the full and simplified versions of three synaptic models, topologic, point and geometric resulting in overall 72 cases. The storage required for the entire brain is estimated in the range from 30 billion neurons and 1 thousand synapses per neuron to 138 billion neurons and 30 thousand synapses per neuron. Then the full synaptic model of the entire human brain requires from 0.21 PB to 28.98 PB for the topologic model, from 0.57 PB to 78.66 PB for the point model, and from 0.69 PB to 95.22 PB for the geometric model, Table 2. For the simplified synaptic model, the topologic model requires from 0.14 PB to 18.63 PB, the point model from 0.32 PB to 43.47 PB, and the geometric model from 0.38 PB to 51.75 PB, Table 2. The simplified model reduces the required storage to 64%, 55%, and 54% for the topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. Note that in all these cases the maximum storage required is 138 times higher than the minimum storage. This results from the fact that the minimum and maximum numbers of neurons are likely to be outliers and a more credible number is 86 billion neurons [25]. Similarly, the approximate number of 30 thousand synapses per neuron reported by Defelipe [41] was measured for a very small tissue sample, so the range of 1–10 thousand synapses per neuron is likely to be more credible. Then, the storage required is from 0.60 (0.39) PB to 6.02 (3.87) PB, from 1.63 (0.90) PB to 16.34 (9.03) PB, and from 1.98 (1.08) PB to 19.78 (10.75) PB for the full (simplified) topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. Note that then the difference between the minimum and maximum storage is 10 times only. The reported number of neurons in different parts of the brain also varies in the literature from 2.6 to 32 billion (12.31 times) for the cerebral cortex and from 50 to 102 billion for the cerebellum (2.04 times), Table 1. Taking the numbers of neurons from the same source [25], the cerebral cortex contains 14%, the cerebellum 80%, and the brainstem/striatum/diencephalon 0.8% of the total number of neurons in the entire human brain. Then, the full synaptic model of the cerebral cortex requires from 86.80 TB to 2.60 PB for the topologic model, from 235.60 TB to 7.07 PB for the point model, and from 285.20 TB to 8.56 PB for the geometric model, Table 3. For the simplified synaptic model of the cerebral cortex, the topologic model needs from 55.80 TB to 1.67 PB, the point model from 130.02 TB to 3.91 PB, and the geometric model from 155.00 TB to 4.65 PB, Table 3. The full synaptic model of the cerebellum requires from 0.48 PB to 14.49 PB for the topologic model, from 1.31 PB to 39.33 PB for the point model, and from 1.59 PB to 47.61 PB for the geometric model, Table 3. For the simplified synaptic model of the cerebellum, the topologic model needs from 0.31 PB to 9.32 PB, the point model from 0.72 PB to 21.74 PB, and the geometric model from 0.86 PB to 35.86 PB, Table 3. The full synaptic model of the brainstem/striatum/diencephalon requires from 4.90 TB to 147.00 TB for the topologic model, from 13.30 TB to 399.00 TB for the point model, and from 16.10 TB to 483.00 TB for the geometric model, Table 3. For the simplified synaptic model of the brainstem/striatum/diencephalon, the topologic model needs from 3.15 TB to 94.50 TB, the point model from 7.35 TB to 220.50 TB, and the geometric model from 8.75 TB to 262.50 TB, Table 3. Note that the above synaptome storage estimations are valid for both the chemical and electrical synaptomes, as the single synapse storage covers the data sampling spatial resolutions of 10 nm and 1 nm. A volumetric image dataset of the entire human brain at the nanoscale enabling the computation of the synaptome and connectome has not yet been acquired. Consequently, any validation of the considered synaptic model with the actual human data is not yet feasible. What is available today is the first large, nanoscale human surgical tissue sample of a 1 mm3 [50] which is employed here to assess the proposed method. Then, our geometric model extended to partly compensate for the seven synaptic annotation attributes in [51] requires 15.3 GB to store this sample whereas [51] reports nearly 27 GB to store the synapses together with the annotated cells and hundreds of millions of neurites. Therefore, these two amounts of storage can be considered roughly comparable. Note that the synaptic representation in [51] requires to store layers as acquired in electron microscopy, however, there is no need to store layers in synchrotron tomography data. Moreover, this is not so straightforward to compare our estimated synaptome data bigness with the actually acquired datasets. The actually acquired datasets can include the raw images, segmentation data, annotations, reconstructions, and various representations like skeletons and connectivity graphs. In addition, the size of data can vary depending on the image resolution, extent of the imaged brain, data format, data simplification, and applied data compression. Note that even for Drosophila, synaptome completeness is beyond the current reach resulting in providing synapse counts that are representatives [45]. On the other hand, our model and storage estimates assume the completeness of the human synaptome. Regarding small animal brains, the localization part of the synapse representation in Drosophila proposed by Scheffer et al. [45] corresponds to our synaptic point model. Namely, the synapses there are stored as point annotations meaning one point for a presynaptic T-bar (corresponding on electron microscopy images to an active zone of the presynaptic terminal), and one point for each of its postsynaptic densities in the postsynaptic terminal (note that some more complex synaptic structures found, e.g., in the cerebellum may exhibit multiple active zones and the corresponding multiple postsynaptic densities). However, the identifiers of the neurons containing their connecting synapses are determined from segmentation which assigns 64-bit neuron identifier to each voxel, meaning requiring 8 B for neuron and 6 B for voxel identifier to distinguish 26 teravoxels. Our point synaptic model scaled to the Drosophila size (see the Results section) requires only 4 B for the synapse identifier meaning it is 10 B smaller per synapse than the synaptic data representation employed by Scheffer et al. [45]. The same method applied here to estimate the storage required for the human synaptome can, in principle, also be used to estimate synaptomes of other animals after the compensation for the synapse identifier dependency on the numbers of neuron and synapses. Namely, the synaptoms of Drosophila and C.elegans are “merely” at the level of megabytes and kilobytes, respectively (Table 4) in comparison to the human synaptome which requires storage at the level of petabytes. Even though the synaptic topologic model for the entire brain is much smaller than each of the synaptic point and geometric models, it is still too big to be stored on today’s top supercomputers related to neuroscience such as Sequoia of 1.5 PB and K of 1.4 PB of memory [2]. For the number of neurons in the range of 86–100 billion, only the case of 1,000 synapses per neuron can fit to this storage (and up to about 2,000 synapses per neuron) whereas the case of 10,000 synapses per neuron does not fit. Note that the simplified point and geometric models for the 1,000 synapses per neuron also fit this amount of storage. For the cerebral cortex with 12.4 billion neurons (Table 1) and in the range of 1,000–10,000 synapses per neuron, the full topologic and simplified point models fit the amount of memory provided by Sequoia or K. Today’s most powerful and world’s first exascale supercomputer Frontier [56] with 9,408 computing nodes each with 4 TB of flash memory offers an overall 37 PB memory. Frontier, for the synaptic model of the entire brain with 86 billion neurons and the 1,000–10,000 range of the number of synapses per neuron, is able to handle the human nanoscale synaptome, and for 30,000 synapses per neuron only the simplified topologic, point, and geometric models. Another exascale supercomputer Aurora with the aggregate system memory of 10.9 PB [57] for 86 billion neurons is able to handle only the simplified synaptic models up to 10,000 synapses per neurons. The storage of the above supercomputers serves as a benchmark for our results. In general, the storage limits of the today’s supercomputers can be overcome either by a network of powerful supercomputers enabling to scale computing resources, such as BRAINS [58], or cloud storage offered by open-source services, such as the Brain Observatory Storage Service and Database which is a cloud-based solution for storing and accessing petascale image datasets [59]. The topologic model is sufficient and the most efficient to compute the connectome or rather its topology. The synaptic point model allows for the construction of the connectomic point model with the locations of the synapses. The synaptic geometric model enables the construction of the connectomic geometric model with the locations and sizes of the synapses. Note that these connectomic models do not allow to construct the exact full path between the consecutive synapses in a microcircuit as in the synaptic model the parameters of the soma, axon, and dendritic and axonal trees (as formulated in [42]) are not available (meaning can be discarded after the calculation of the synaptome). The introduced synaptic models are useful for morphometric and network-related analyses. The topologic model allows for the determination of the number of microcircuits, loops, and feedbacks. The point model enables the calculation of synaptic densities and patterns of interconnectivity such as distributions of microcircuits with respect to length, underlying structures and tracts, and local and global networks (subsystems). In particular, this includes the distribution of microcircuits among the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and subcortical structures as well as their distribution among the cerebral and cerebellar cortical layers. Other network-related features also can be calculated including clusters (hubs), worldness, betweenness centrality, and motifs. The geometric model additionally enables the calculation of the distribution of the terminal sizes (provided that they, especially the postsynaptic terminals, are feasible to be determined). Storage-wise this work is limited to the size of the already calculated synaptome. However, its calculation requires a much bigger storage to handle all the neurons along with their complete dendritic and axonal trees as estimated in [54]. In addition, synchrotron tomography requires also space for numerous projections from which the volumetric raw data are calculated. Depending on the spatial resolution, the volumetric raw data require from 2,800 exabytes (EB) for 10 nm resolution (to image chemical synapses) to 2,800,000 (EB) for 1 nm resolution (to image electrical synapses) [54]. By converting the volumetric raw data into a geometric model, the storage required, depending on the type of geometric model, ranges from 20.56 PB to 82.56 PB for 86 billion neurons and 10,000 synapses per neuron [54]. Model-wise this work is restricted to synaptome morphology although the synaptome size can be expected to be much higher at the molecular level. For instance, in [60] the mouse synaptome was considered at the molecular level by cataloging and mapping enormous synapse diversity. Namely, the postsynaptic proteome contains more than 1,000 proteins whereas as few as 10 proteins could produce 1,023 types and 1011 subtypes of excitatory synapses. Neurodegenerative processes cause death of neurons and synapse loss, degeneration of synapses, and the spread of pathology through the brain via synapses. Therefore, the study of synaptome is also vital from the standpoint of synaptopathy, meaning the disturbances in neuronal connectivity, which with the increasing awareness is one of the first pathological even in many neurologic disorders [40]. Studies of synapses in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [61–64], dementia with Lewy bodies [65], and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [66] demonstrated changes in synaptic density and morphology as well as molecular composition and the aggregation of disease-associated proteins in the synapse which may disrupt its structure and function. In AD, the loss of synapses also correlates with a cognitive decline [61,63]. Moreover, some evidence indicates that synaptopathy underlines a variety of psychiatric disorders [67]. The involvement of synaptic disturbances in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia was reviewed by Obi-Nagata et al. [24]. The schizophrenic patients were observed to have the reduced dendritic spine density [68–70]. Glanz et al. [68] reported that in schizophrenic subjects, spine density in the prefrontal cortex was decreased by 23% compared with normal control subjects. Garey et al. [69] demonstrated the 66% dendritic spine density decrease in frontal regions and 59% decrease in temporal regions in cortical layer III. Konopaske et al. [70] observed that the number of spines per dendrite was reduced by 21.6% for the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The decrease in spine number was only observed for smaller spines and not for larger spines [71] resulting in less plastic circuits (as large spines are generally highly stable and small spines are more plastic and related to learning and behavioral flexibility [72]). Therefore based on these studies, this is likely to expect the storage required for the synaptome of persons with neurologic disorders to be smaller than that needed for the normal subjects. It remains still unclear how generalizable are these findings across all cortical layers and the entire cerebral cortex. Nevertheless, assuming in average a 25% spine density decrease for the whole cerebral cortex and taking 86 billion neurons in the entire brain, the required storage for the diseased cerebral cortical synaptome would range from the minimum of 41.85 TB for the topologic simplified model with 1,000 synapses per neuron to the maximum of 6417 TB for the full geometric model with 30,000 synapses per neuron (compare with Table 3). Finally comparing the human genome and synaptome, the storage required for the human genome varies (depending on coverage) from 30 GB to 200 GB [73] and it seems today rather “small” in comparison to that required for the human nanoscale synaptome that is at the level of petabytes. However, to store hundreds of thousands of human genomes it is estimated that 2–40 EB of storage capacity will be needed by 2025 [73]. As a similar trend may be expected in neuroscience, this estimation gives some idea of how enormous storage will be required to store hundreds of thousands of human synaptomes and connectomes. A key challenge in neuroscience is to generate the human nanoscale connectome which requires knowledge of synaptome forming the neural microcircuits. The synaptic architecture determines the limits of individual mental capacity and provides the framework for understanding neurologic disorders. Toward this objective, I here address morphology modeling and storage estimation for the human synaptome at the nanoscale. The storage required for the human synaptome depends on the number of synapses and the storage necessary for a single synapse determined by a synaptic model. I here introduce three synaptic morphology models with diverse content and potential applications: topologic with topology, point with topology and location, and geometric with topology, location, and geometry. They are useful for morphometric and network-related analyses. The topologic model allows for the determination of the number of microcircuits, loops, and feedbacks. The point model enables the calculation of synaptic densities and patterns of interconnectivity. The geometric model additionally enables the calculation of the distribution of terminal sizes. The number of neurons in the human brain and its parts reported in various studies highly ranges because of large biological variability among individual brains and different cerebral regions as well as diverse cell counting methods employed. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the number of neurons and synapses reported in numerous sources, four cases of the number of neurons in the brain (30; 86; 100; and 138 billion) and three cases of synapses per neuron (1,000; 10,000; and 30,000) are considered with three synaptic models with the full and simplified (to reduce storage) versions resulting in total 72 cases for which the storage required for the synaptome is estimated. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the entire human brain requires from 0.21(0.14) PB to 28.98(18.63) PB for the topologic model, from 0.57(0.32) PB to 78.66(43.47) PB for the point model, and from 0.69(0.38) PB to 95.22(51.75) PB for the geometric model. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the cerebral cortex needs from 86.80(55.80) TB to 2.60(1.67) PB for the topologic model, from 235.60(130.02) TB to 7.07(3.91) PB for the point model, and from 285.20(155.00) TB to 8.56(4.65) PB for the geometric model. The full synaptic model of the cerebellum requires from 0.48(0.31) PB to 14.49(9.32) PB for the topologic model, from 1.31(0.72) PB to 39.33(21.74) PB for the point model, and from 1.59(0.86) PB to 47.61(35.86) PB for the geometric model. The full (simplified) synaptic model of the brainstem/striatum/diencephalon requires from 4.90(3.15) TB to 147.00(94.50) TB for the topologic model, from 13.30(7.35) TB to 399.00(220.50) TB for the point model, and from 16.10(8.75) TB to 483.00(262.50) TB for the geometric model. The topologic model is sufficient and the most efficient to compute the connectome or rather its topology, however, even though it is much smaller than each of the synaptome point and geometric models, it is still too big to be stored on today’s top supercomputers related to neuroscience such as Sequoia of 1.5 PB and K of 1.4 PB of memory (and for the number of neurons in the range of 86–100 billion, only neurons with up to about 2,000 synapses can fit to this storage). The most powerful world’s supercomputer Frontier for the entire brain with 86 billion neurons and the 1,000–10,000 number of synapses per neuron is able to handle the human nanoscale synaptome, and for 30,000 synapses per neuron only the simplified topologic, point, and geometric models. The storage limits of today’s supercomputers can be overcome either by a network of powerful supercomputers enabling to scale computing resources or cloud storage offered by open-source services. The human synaptome requires storage at the level of petabytes whereas the synaptoms for Drosophila and C.elegans are “merely” at the level of megabytes and kilobytes, respectively. In the future, to store hundreds of thousands of human synaptomes and connectomes, storage at the level of exabytes or higher will be required. To my best knowledge, this is the first big data effort attempting to provide storage requirement estimation for the human nanoscale synaptome. This work has been inspired by the SYNAPSE (Synchrotron for Neuroscience–an Asia-Pacific Strategic Enterprise) efforts aiming to map the entire human brain at sub-cellular resolution demonstrating the neuronal network connections and my invited talk presented at the SYNAPSE 2022 general meeting. I would like to thank Prof. Ann-Shyn Chiang, the creator of the Drosophila connectome, for providing valuable insights regarding connectomic data size.

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/25/2024 6:44:37 AM PDT by MtnClimber For families struggling to make ends meet, Kamala Harris claims she has a plan to lower energy costs. What she will deliver is more pain. Just ask anyone paying energy bills in a state her party controls. On Harris’ campaign website, she pays lip service to reducing energy costs, but then rattles off a long list of plans to tackle the “climate crisis.” We already know you can’t have one with the other. At a congressional hearing last week, members of the House Budget Committee heard from witnesses about how Biden-Harris policies have fueled today’s energy crisis. One of the witnesses, Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the Heritage Foundation, presented lawmakers with a chart that deserves to be seen by anyone and everyone paying utility bills. The chart ranks states based on the cost of electricity, as well as the cost of a gallon of gas. Looking at the chart, you immediately notice something. Of the 16 states where electricity costs are higher than the national average, Republicans control only two. All the rest are either completely or partially run by Democrats. Why are their energy bills so high? Well, all but two have imposed strict mandates for renewable energy – meaning that more than 15% of their electricity will have to come from “clean” sources by 2035. What’s more, all but six also want 100% of cars sold in the state to be EVs by 2035. In other words, these Blue states are fully bought into the climate “crisis.” (Republican-controlled Alaska is an outlier because it has its own unique energy challenges.) Meanwhile, of the 10 states with the lowest electricity rates, only Washington is controlled by Democrats. It has a strict renewable standard, and an EV mandate. But as Furtchgott-Roth notes, Washington is also a special case because 60% of its energy comes from hydropower (a cheap and “clean” energy source that environmentalists hate because it requires damming rivers). The difference in household utility bills between these Blue and Red states is stark, with Californians paying nearly three times what Louisianans do, for example. And this is just the beginning. Wait until those costly renewable mandates – combined with the surge in electricity demand that will result from state EV mandates and the growth of artificial intelligence – are in full force. Then Blue-state electricity costs will be stratospheric. Keep in mind, too, that higher energy prices impact everything you buy because energy costs affect every business, and those costs are always passed down to consumers. So the overall cost of living in Blue states is higher as a result. At the same time, the chart above also shows that gasoline prices tend to be higher in these Blue states. Sometimes much, much higher. A gallon of gasoline in California costs $4.75, but only $3.18 in Florida. These price differences, too, are largely caused by taxes and regulations. What are those ratepayers and drivers in Blue states getting for all those extra costs? Nothing. Politicians in these states pass laws pushed by radical environmentalists to make themselves feel good. The costs are paid for by working families already struggling to make ends meet. And the impact on the climate is … zero. Even if every state in the nation went 100% renewable, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference to global temperatures, given that China and India are pumping out more CO2 each year than the U.S. could possibly ever cut. The question Democrats need to answer is “Why do they hate their residents so much?” But residents also need to ask themselves why they put up with such lunacy. Our guess is that most of them don’t know they’re being royally screwed. The problem is that, no matter what Harris claims today, she desperately wants to make the entire country like those Blue states. Which is another reason why every American should see (and share) the chart before they vote in November.

It doesn’t tell the whole story. In my state the prices given don’t tell the whole story & the “average” prices shown are not necessarily a true average. Our electrical rates are on a sliding scale & the rate shown probably doesn’t equal the actual “per KWH” rate you are paying. The gas price will depend on exactly where you live. The heavy users may get a cheaper rate. The low end users will possibly (likely) pay more than the rate shown on the chart. 10 posted on 09/25/2024 7:38:25 AM PDT by oldtech [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber In some parts of NH, gas is down to $2.89.

Of course their answer creates a really big problem for the average citizen.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson We already know you can’t have one with the other. At a congressional hearing last week, members of the House Budget Committee heard from witnesses about how Biden-Harris policies have fueled today’s energy crisis. One of the witnesses, Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the Heritage Foundation, presented lawmakers with a chart that deserves to be seen by anyone and everyone paying utility bills. The chart ranks states based on the cost of electricity, as well as the cost of a gallon of gas. Looking at the chart, you immediately notice something. Of the 16 states where electricity costs are higher than the national average, Republicans control only two. All the rest are either completely or partially run by Democrats. Why are their energy bills so high? Well, all but two have imposed strict mandates for renewable energy – meaning that more than 15% of their electricity will have to come from “clean” sources by 2035. What’s more, all but six also want 100% of cars sold in the state to be EVs by 2035. In other words, these Blue states are fully bought into the climate “crisis.” (Republican-controlled Alaska is an outlier because it has its own unique energy challenges.) Meanwhile, of the 10 states with the lowest electricity rates, only Washington is controlled by Democrats. It has a strict renewable standard, and an EV mandate. But as Furtchgott-Roth notes, Washington is also a special case because 60% of its energy comes from hydropower (a cheap and “clean” energy source that environmentalists hate because it requires damming rivers). The difference in household utility bills between these Blue and Red states is stark, with Californians paying nearly three times what Louisianans do, for example. And this is just the beginning. Wait until those costly renewable mandates – combined with the surge in electricity demand that will result from state EV mandates and the growth of artificial intelligence – are in full force. Then Blue-state electricity costs will be stratospheric. Keep in mind, too, that higher energy prices impact everything you buy because energy costs affect every business, and those costs are always passed down to consumers. So the overall cost of living in Blue states is higher as a result. At the same time, the chart above also shows that gasoline prices tend to be higher in these Blue states. Sometimes much, much higher. A gallon of gasoline in California costs $4.75, but only $3.18 in Florida. These price differences, too, are largely caused by taxes and regulations. What are those ratepayers and drivers in Blue states getting for all those extra costs? Nothing. Politicians in these states pass laws pushed by radical environmentalists to make themselves feel good. The costs are paid for by working families already struggling to make ends meet. And the impact on the climate is … zero. Even if every state in the nation went 100% renewable, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference to global temperatures, given that China and India are pumping out more CO2 each year than the U.S. could possibly ever cut. The question Democrats need to answer is “Why do they hate their residents so much?” But residents also need to ask themselves why they put up with such lunacy. Our guess is that most of them don’t know they’re being royally screwed. The problem is that, no matter what Harris claims today, she desperately wants to make the entire country like those Blue states. Which is another reason why every American should see (and share) the chart before they vote in November.

Of the 16 states where electricity costs are higher than the national average, Republicans control only two. All the rest are either completely or partially run by Democrats. Why are their energy bills so high? Well, all but two have imposed strict mandates for renewable energy – meaning that more than 15% of their electricity will have to come from “clean” sources by 2035. What’s more, all but six also want 100% of cars sold in the state to be EVs by 2035. In other words, these Blue states are fully bought into the climate “crisis.” (Republican-controlled Alaska is an outlier because it has its own unique energy challenges.) Meanwhile, of the 10 states with the lowest electricity rates, only Washington is controlled by Democrats. It has a strict renewable standard, and an EV mandate. But as Furtchgott-Roth notes, Washington is also a special case because 60% of its energy comes from hydropower (a cheap and “clean” energy source that environmentalists hate because it requires damming rivers). The difference in household utility bills between these Blue and Red states is stark, with Californians paying nearly three times what Louisianans do, for example. And this is just the beginning. Wait until those costly renewable mandates – combined with the surge in electricity demand that will result from state EV mandates and the growth of artificial intelligence – are in full force. Then Blue-state electricity costs will be stratospheric. Keep in mind, too, that higher energy prices impact everything you buy because energy costs affect every business, and those costs are always passed down to consumers. So the overall cost of living in Blue states is higher as a result. At the same time, the chart above also shows that gasoline prices tend to be higher in these Blue states. Sometimes much, much higher. A gallon of gasoline in California costs $4.75, but only $3.18 in Florida. These price differences, too, are largely caused by taxes and regulations. What are those ratepayers and drivers in Blue states getting for all those extra costs? Nothing. Politicians in these states pass laws pushed by radical environmentalists to make themselves feel good. The costs are paid for by working families already struggling to make ends meet. And the impact on the climate is … zero. Even if every state in the nation went 100% renewable, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference to global temperatures, given that China and India are pumping out more CO2 each year than the U.S. could possibly ever cut. The question Democrats need to answer is “Why do they hate their residents so much?” But residents also need to ask themselves why they put up with such lunacy. Our guess is that most of them don’t know they’re being royally screwed. The problem is that, no matter what Harris claims today, she desperately wants to make the entire country like those Blue states. Which is another reason why every American should see (and share) the chart before they vote in November.

Meanwhile, of the 10 states with the lowest electricity rates, only Washington is controlled by Democrats. It has a strict renewable standard, and an EV mandate. But as Furtchgott-Roth notes, Washington is also a special case because 60% of its energy comes from hydropower (a cheap and “clean” energy source that environmentalists hate because it requires damming rivers). The difference in household utility bills between these Blue and Red states is stark, with Californians paying nearly three times what Louisianans do, for example. And this is just the beginning. Wait until those costly renewable mandates – combined with the surge in electricity demand that will result from state EV mandates and the growth of artificial intelligence – are in full force. Then Blue-state electricity costs will be stratospheric. Keep in mind, too, that higher energy prices impact everything you buy because energy costs affect every business, and those costs are always passed down to consumers. So the overall cost of living in Blue states is higher as a result. At the same time, the chart above also shows that gasoline prices tend to be higher in these Blue states. Sometimes much, much higher. A gallon of gasoline in California costs $4.75, but only $3.18 in Florida. These price differences, too, are largely caused by taxes and regulations. What are those ratepayers and drivers in Blue states getting for all those extra costs? Nothing. Politicians in these states pass laws pushed by radical environmentalists to make themselves feel good. The costs are paid for by working families already struggling to make ends meet. And the impact on the climate is … zero. Even if every state in the nation went 100% renewable, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference to global temperatures, given that China and India are pumping out more CO2 each year than the U.S. could possibly ever cut. The question Democrats need to answer is “Why do they hate their residents so much?” But residents also need to ask themselves why they put up with such lunacy. Our guess is that most of them don’t know they’re being royally screwed. The problem is that, no matter what Harris claims today, she desperately wants to make the entire country like those Blue states.

Wait until those costly renewable mandates – combined with the surge in electricity demand that will result from state EV mandates and the growth of artificial intelligence – are in full force. Then Blue-state electricity costs will be stratospheric. Keep in mind, too, that higher energy prices impact everything you buy because energy costs affect every business, and those costs are always passed down to consumers. So the overall cost of living in Blue states is higher as a result. At the same time, the chart above also shows that gasoline prices tend to be higher in these Blue states. Sometimes much, much higher. A gallon of gasoline in California costs $4.75, but only $3.18 in Florida. These price differences, too, are largely caused by taxes and regulations. What are those ratepayers and drivers in Blue states getting for all those extra costs? Nothing. Politicians in these states pass laws pushed by radical environmentalists to make themselves feel good. The costs are paid for by working families already struggling to make ends meet. And the impact on the climate is … zero. Even if every state in the nation went 100% renewable, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference to global temperatures, given that China and India are pumping out more CO2 each year than the U.S. could possibly ever cut. The question Democrats need to answer is “Why do they hate their residents so much?” But residents also need to ask themselves why they put up with such lunacy. Our guess is that most of them don’t know they’re being royally screwed. The problem is that, no matter what Harris claims today, she desperately wants to make the entire country like those Blue states. Which is another reason why every American should see (and share) the chart before they vote in November.

Full Content:
Former Fox News host and MAGA commentator Tucker Carlson praised conspiracy theorist Alex Jones as “vindicated on everything” in a wild national tour stop in Pennsylvania on Tuesday. Carlson talked first with right-wing political activist Jack Posobiec but it was Jones who received the rockstar welcome on-stage to roaring applause from the audience. Jones, the host and owner of controversial conspiracy-peddling outlet InfoWars, is facing a $1.4 billion judgment for defaming the families of the Sandy Hook school shooting after claiming that the attack was a false-flag operation by the U.S. government to repeal gun ownership rights. The case has left his assets and media company under court control. This didn’t stop Carlson’s enthusiastic introduction of the provocateur as “the most extraordinary person” he’d ever met, adding that he was “proud” to host Jones. Jones then raised the host’s earlier criticism of globalism with the kind of fiery rhetoric that has earned him a fervent following online. Jones began: “Well, thanks for having me. I gotta say, I love you. This is a beautiful state. full of beautiful people. And when we get President Trump elected, all of us, together, are going to lift the curse off of this country and we’re going to send the globalists to prison.” He continued: “And it is amazing to meet all these great people, whether they’re Black, white, old, young, to see the electricity in people’s eyes that are populist and that are Americans and that love God and that love children and love freedom and hate tyranny. I can feel the strength in this auditorium at capacity in Reading, Pennsylvania. And like I told the globalists a long time ago, I don’t know how long this going to end, but if they want fight, they better believe they’ve got it.” Carlson interrupted: “It just makes me laugh. Alex Jones: so controversial. Love God, love America, love freedom. Oh, you’re so radical!” He laughed as more applause rose up. Jones pressed on: “I’m for the war, peacefully with information, against the globalists. The real war is here with the globalists and [George] Soros and [Barack] Obama and the New World Order and [investment firm] BlackRock. They’ve declared war on us and we accept the challenge. We’re taking the country back.” Watch above via X. Have a tip for us? tips@mediaite.com Have a tip or story idea? Email us. Or to keep it anonymous, click here.

BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has reached a new 52-week high, with its stock price soaring to $942.73, underscoring the investment management firm's strong performance over the past year. This milestone reflects a significant uptrend in the company's valuation, marking a 45.54% increase in the 1-year change data. Investors have shown increased confidence in BlackRock's strategic initiatives and market positioning, which have contributed to the company's robust growth trajectory and its stock's impressive climb to this new height. In other recent news, BlackRock, the leading global asset manager, has seen noteworthy developments. The Italian government has approved BlackRock's increased stake in the defense and aerospace group, Leonardo, allowing the asset manager to hold more than a 3% stake. This development aligns with Italy's regulatory requirements for investments in strategic sectors. Additionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has authorized options trading linked to BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking a significant milestone for the company's cryptocurrency-related offerings. This approval is expected to attract a wider range of investors and increase market activity for bitcoin. In analyst news, TD Cowen has maintained a Buy rating for BlackRock, following the company's announcement of the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP). The platform, which aims to raise $30 billion in equity and a total of $100 billion when including debt, underscores BlackRock's commitment to innovative investment opportunities and infrastructure development. Furthermore, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), has launched a joint fund exceeding $30 billion to bolster artificial intelligence infrastructure. This fund is set to invest in data centers and energy projects essential for the computational demands of AI. Lastly, the BlackRock Investment Institute has indicated that the Federal Reserve may not implement interest rate cuts as significantly as the bond market anticipates, suggesting a more conservative approach due to economic resilience and persistent inflation. This perspective may impact short-term U.S. Treasuries and U.S. stocks, as current yields seem to be factoring in the anticipated deep rate cuts. BlackRock, Inc. (BLK) has demonstrated a commendable track record, with a 14-year history of raising its dividend, signaling a strong commitment to shareholder returns. This is further supported by the company's 22-year streak of maintaining dividend payments. The recent performance has been notable, with BlackRock's stock price nearing its 52-week high, reflecting investor optimism and a robust 46.81% one-year price total return as of the latest data. InvestingPro Tips reveal that BlackRock is trading at a high P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, suggesting that the market has high expectations for the company's future performance. Additionally, the firm's liquid assets surpass its short-term obligations, indicating financial stability and the ability to meet immediate financial needs. InvestingPro Data highlights a market capitalization of $139.39 billion, with a P/E ratio of 23.07 and a PEG ratio of 1.31, which combines the company's earnings growth into the valuation.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF options get SEC nod – Here’s all you need to know

How will BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF approval impact the broader cryptocurrency market? In recent days, significant attention was drawn to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of BlackRock’s proposal to list and trade options for its spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF, IBIT. Approved on the 20th of September, the SEC fast-tracked the decision, granting the world’s largest asset manager the green light to list these options. Source: www.sec.gov The approval allowed the options to be traded on the Nasdaq ISE, LLC, marking a major milestone in BlackRock’s BTC-related initiatives. This signaled a new chapter for cryptocurrency investment options. Highlighting why BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF stands out as the top choice, Joshua Lim, co-founder of Arbelos Markets, shared insights in a recent X thread. Lim pointed out several key factors that make Blackrock’s BTC ETF the best bet in the current market. He said, “BTC is a digital-native asset by definition, it’s a lot easier to financialize it and move it around for trade settlements than other commods. IBIT and the other ETFs have increased velocity making certain otherwise cold-storage-bound BTC available for liquid trading.” Expanding on his argument, Lim emphasized that prime brokers providing margin lending in USD against BTC collateral could substantially boost the cash supply within the crypto market. This increased liquidity, he suggests, would likely find its way into riskier segments of the ecosystem, with capital moving from spot bitcoin ETFs into speculative assets such as memecoins and NFTs. Lim believes this shift could stimulate further investment in these alternative assets, reshaping the broader crypto landscape. He also added, “Options markets on IBIT (and market-maker willingness to bear the risk) will make it easier to price the risk inherent in margin lending against IBIT and make it more likely for prime brokers to lend against crypto… there will be an altcoin boom.” Now the obvious question arises: How will this approval influence the trajectory of the world’s largest cryptocurrency? To which the ETF Store President Nate Geraci replied, Source: Nate Geraci/X Even while the approval was still in the pipeline, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believed, Source: Eric Balchunas/X Seeing this huge move by Blackrock, firms like Grayscale and Bitwise have also been looking to list and trade options for their spot BTC ETFs. This follows the SEC’s approval of 11 spot BTC ETFs in January. Amid the growing excitement, Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise, offered a different viewpoint of the situation, and stated, “Things will likely get wild. In such scenarios, regulated markets may shut down. But the remarkable thing about Bitcoin is that there will always be a parallel, decentralized market that can’t be shut down, unlike GME—which, as you can imagine, will add even more fuel to the fire.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Good morning! I've been known to make a bet or two in my day, which is why I'm wondering the odds you could get betting you'd have four kids with the same birthday. In today's big story, the economy is heading in the right direction, but consumers aren't buying it. What's on deck: But first, the vibes are all off. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, the stock market reached all-time highs, and the risk of a recession is gone. Things seem to be going really well for the economy, right? Wrong. Consumers aren't feeling bullish about the economy these days. In fact, they're quite pessimistic. US consumer confidence suffered its biggest drop in three years this month, according to data from the Conference Board. We've been here before. For much of 2022 and 2023, Americans were in a "vibecession" where their perception of the economy was much worse than the data indicated. Last time around, pesky inflation was keeping things like groceries and housing costs high, even as the rest of the economy showed improvement. This time, the labor market's the culprit, writes Business Insider's Juliana Kaplan. But it's not mass layoffs most people are worried about. Having a job isn't the issue — the unemployment rate is just 4.2% — as much as finding the next gig. It's no wonder that consumers aged 35 to 54 suffered the biggest drop in confidence, according to the Conference Board. This group, which is in its prime earning years, is facing a job market that's keeping them stuck in place. The labor market isn't a lost cause, though. The Fed has acknowledged its top priority is keeping an eye on job growth and unemployment. We'll get a sense of which direction things are headed on October 4 when we get September's payroll data. Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, Mike Wilson, recently outlined the best- and worst-case scenarios for the numbers in regard to the stock market. If unemployment dips below 4.1% and non-farm payroll can surpass 150,000, consider it game on for a big fourth quarter for stocks. But if unemployment climbs to 4.3% and non-farm payroll drops below 100,000, buckle up for a bumpy ride. The stock market isn't representative of the entire economy, as we've already covered. But continued success there could give companies more confidence to start hiring again. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Alphabet shares target cut, keeps outperform on investor concern
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/alphabet-shares-target-cut-keeps-outperform-on-investor-concern-93CH-3631984
Time Published: 2024-09-25T12:53:46Z
Full Content:
On Wednesday, Oppenheimer has revised its price target for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares, the parent company of Google, reducing it to $185 from the previous $210. Despite the price target adjustment, the firm maintains an Outperform rating on the stock. The reduction in the price target comes amid investor concerns over Google's search engine being labeled a monopoly and the potential loss of its exclusivity with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices. Google is responsible for generating 31% of its gross search revenue, amounting to $61 billion, through Apple devices. It pays Apple 36% of that revenue to maintain exclusivity, which translates to 19% of Google's net ad exposure. Oppenheimer's assessment suggests that Google would only need to retain 65% of search activity from Apple users if no Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC) are paid, or 75% if TAC drops to 15%. This comes in the context of a survey from April indicating that 75% of users would choose Google as their default search engine, and 78% would download Chrome if Google Search was not available in Safari. The firm also noted the separate Department of Justice case against Google's Adtech business, estimating it to represent less than 2% of Alphabet's equity value. The new stock price target of $185 is based on a 20x multiple of the company's expected 2026 earnings, discounted at 8%, or a 21x multiple of the 2025 estimated earnings, compared to the NASDAQ's average P/E ratio of 25x. In other recent news, Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, is facing a $9.3 billion antitrust lawsuit in the UK, which it has asked a tribunal to dismiss. The suit alleges Google has abused its dominance in the online search market. Simultaneously, Alphabet Inc. has successfully overturned a 1.49 billion euro ($1.66 billion) antitrust fine imposed by the EU, originally levied for practices that allegedly hindered rivals in the online search advertising market. In the realm of financial analysis, TD Cowen has maintained a Buy rating for Alphabet, suggesting that potential changes in Google's default search engine status on Apple's Safari browser may not significantly affect Google's 2026 U.S. Search revenue. Meanwhile, DA Davidson has initiated a neutral rating for Alphabet, outlining potential challenges and opportunities for the company, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence. In terms of regulatory actions, the EU is currently directing Google to cease anti-competitive actions within its advertising technology sector, with a breakup order not expected at this time. However, the European Commission may consider such a measure in the future if Google continues its anti-competitive behavior. These are the recent developments surrounding Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary, Google. As investors digest Oppenheimer's revised price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), it is valuable to consider some key financial metrics and expert analysis that could further inform their decisions. Alphabet's market capitalization stands robust at $2.02 trillion, reflecting its significant presence in the tech industry. Notably, Alphabet is trading at a P/E ratio of 23.1, which is attractive when paired with its near-term earnings growth prospects. This aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting the company's low P/E ratio in relation to its expected earnings expansion. Another InvestingPro Tip worth mentioning is the company's strong financial position, as it holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide resilience against market volatility and strategic flexibility. Moreover, Alphabet's revenue growth over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 stands at an impressive 13.38%, with a gross profit margin of 57.64%, indicating efficient operations and a strong market position. For investors seeking more comprehensive insights, InvestingPro offers additional tips, including Alphabet's status as a prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry and its ability to cover interest payments comfortably with its cash flows. In total, there are 10 more InvestingPro Tips available for Alphabet, which can be found at https://www.investing.com/pro/GOOG, providing a deeper dive into the company's financial health and market outlook.

Title: Eni CEO Expects Brent Oil Price to Rebound to $80 in Q4

There is extreme volatility in oil prices, Eni’s top executive said. The supply chain is not supporting the demand of around 104 million barrels per day (bpd), Descalzi said, adding that while there is production potential, there aren’t many projects and investments in the upstream sector. The ‘time to market’ timelines are too long, the executive noted. Brent Crude prices were trading just below $74 per barrel early on Wednesday, down by 1.6% on the day, as traders started to digest China’s massive stimulus that made the oil market euphoric on Tuesday. Brent at around $80 per barrel for the rest of the year is the call of most investment banks and analysts. Macquarie has revised down its forecast for Brent Crude price by $2 per barrel to $80 for the rest of 2024. Earlier this month, the bank cut by the same amount its estimate for the WTI Crude price, expecting it to average $75 a barrel for the remainder of the year. However, Macquarie expects the oil market to tip into a surplus over the next five quarters, due to weaker-than-expected demand. Weaker Chinese oil demand, high inventories, and rising U.S. shale production have prompted Goldman Sachs to reduce its expected range for Brent oil prices by $5 to $70-$85 per barrel. Just two weeks after lowering its Brent estimate to $80 per barrel for the fourth quarter, Morgan Stanley cut again its forecast, now expecting the international benchmark to average $75 a barrel in the last quarter of the year. Analysts at Morgan Stanley see rising headwinds on the demand side, which has been their key reason for cutting their Q4 oil price forecast.

Title: Gen Z are ‘conscious unbossing’—they’re avoiding stressful middle management roles
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/09/25/gen-z-conscious-unbossing-avoiding-stressful-middle-management-roles-robert-walters/
Time Published: 2024-09-25T11:33:45Z
Full Content:
Tech giants have spent the last two years culling their middle managers. Amazon was the latest to send theirs to the chopping block just last week. Now, Gen Zers don’t even want to climb the greasy pole. In fact, 72% of the youngest generation of workers say they’d rather progress in an individual contributor role than become middle managers, according to the recruitment firm Robert Walters. Although just 16% of the 3,600 Gen Zers surveyed said that they will avoid middle management at all cost, it’s clear that the majority of young people today aren’t keen on the idea of managing others. Over half of Gen Zers expressed that they don’t want to be middle managers, as part of a trend that has been dubbed ‘conscious unbossing.’ Even the 36% of respondents who said they do anticipate stepping into a managerial position at some point in their careers, admitted they don’t actually want to. It’s not that Gen Z workers don’t want success—they’d just rather it didn’t come with the responsibility of managing others. Lucy Bisset, a director at Robert Walters, said that Gen Z prefers to bring their “whole self to projects and spend time cultivating their own brand and approach, rather than spending time managing others.” A clear example of this is the rise in young people ditching the corporate rat race to become their own boss—or an influencer. According to LinkedIn, the second fastest-growing job title among Gen Z grads right now is “founder.” Read more from Fortune –Sam Altman says it’s relentless and all-consuming to run OpenAI teams after shock CTO departure –YouTube’s MrBeast looks for ‘obsessed’ employees to help run his $700 million company, per leaked handbook –Here’s what actually makes employees happy and more likely to stay at their jobs –Laurene Powell Jobs is one of Kamala Harris’s biggest bankrollers—and closest friends –‘As painful as disruption is, it’s not negotiable’ says CarMax’s CEO Meanwhile, separate data shows that more than half of Gen Z say they would become full-time influencers if they had the opportunity, and the percentage has only gone up in surveys dating back to 2019. “My generation don’t want to go work a consulting or banking job. They don’t even want to be an astronaut anymore,” Steven Schwartz, the Gen Z founder and CEO of the multimillion-dollar marketplace Whop previously told Fortune. “They want to make content online, they want to find customers online… Being educated with more information about what people can do, why would they want to do something that isn’t the most elite experience and the most fun for them?” Really, it’s hard to know whether Gen Zers would actually turn down management roles. With the oldest of the generation turning 27 this year, many won’t have been offered the opportunity to step up yet—but it’s hardly surprising they’ve been put off. Having joined the world of work during tech company’s quest for “efficiency,” Gen Z has repeatedly been sent the message that middle managers are disposable. At Google, where 12,000 managers lost their jobs last year, workers have been told it will be harder to get promoted into management roles going forward. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Zuckerberg said that “flattening” its internal hierarchy was core to its restructure last year. He credited Elon Musk as the source of inspiration behind having “fewer layers of management.” In fact, middle-management positions accounted for almost one-third of layoffs in 2023, Bloomberg found, up from 20% in 2018—and the “great unbossing” trend hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down. Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he wants to “increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15%” (by cutting the number of managers at the tech giant). What’s more, even middle managers who haven’t been laid off are opting to walk out of the role. Earlier this year, a global study found that 75% of millennial managers feel overwhelmed, stressed, and burnt out. As a result, many are eyeing the exit and looking for non-management gigs. Is it any wonder that when Robert Waters asked young people why they’re turning their noses up at middle management jobs, nearly 70% responded: “Too high stress, low reward.” “Those new to middle management experience a steep step-up in workload, further expectations to be ‘always available’ to those they manage, as well continuing pressure to hit their own targets,” Bisset explained. “It’s clear how these roles can prove overwhelming and deter many from taking on the extra responsibility.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

More Info BlackRock expects the AI boom and data centers to drive a 50% jump in energy consumption in the Asia Pacific region over the next decade, a senior executive at the world’s largest asset manager said on Wednesday. “The need for data centers over the next five years is going to be double what is currently in the markets,” Brad Kim, BlackRock’s Asia Pacific managing director for global infrastructure funds, told a media briefing, as carried by Bloomberg. “[O]verall energy consumption will increase by about 50% in the next 10 years across Asia Pacific,” the executive added. Technology giants have already started to secure long-term power contracts in Asia, where electricity and overall energy demand are rising and will rise more than previously expected, due to the demand for data centers and AI development. Last month, Microsoft signed a deal to buy all the solar power from a project in Singapore as the tech giant seeks to achieve its goal of having 100% of its electricity consumption, 100% of the time, matched by zero-carbon energy purchases by 2030. Microsoft has signed an agreement with EDP Renewables, a Spain-based company, to buy 100% percent of the renewable energy exported to the grid from EDP Renewables’ SolarNova 8 project in Singapore. Asia will present huge opportunities for investment in infrastructure, including in energy infrastructure, as the AI boom unfolds, BlackRock says. “Every client we speak to is interested in investing in infrastructure, specifically energy transition and digital related infrastructure,” Charlie Reid, head of APAC renewable power investments at BlackRock, said, as quoted by Bloomberg. Earlier this month, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft, and MGX launched a new AI partnership to invest in data centers and support power infrastructure. The partnership will initially seek to unlock $30 billion of private equity capital over time from investors, asset owners, and corporates, which in turn will mobilize up to $100 billion in total investment potential when including debt financing. “Mobilizing private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centers and power will unlock a multi-trillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity,” said Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock.

BlackRock’s IBIT ETF leads Bitcoin inflows with $98.9 million while smaller ETFs remain flat. On Sept. 24, Bitcoin ETFs recorded a substantial inflow, totaling $136 million, driven primarily by BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, which saw an inflow of $98.9 million, marking the most significant movement of the day. Bitwise’s BITB ETF added $17.4 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC contributed $16.8 million. Grayscale’s smaller BTC ETF reported a modest inflow of $2.9 million, with GBTC flat. Other ETFs, including those from Ark, Invesco, Franklin, Valkyrie, VanEck, and WisdomTree, showed no activity, maintaining flat flows. Ethereum ETFs experienced notable inflows, totaling $62.5 million. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF led the inflows with $59.3 million, suggesting a renewed interest in Ethereum exposure from institutional investors. VanEck’s ETHV and Invesco’s QETH ETFs also saw smaller inflows of $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively. All other Ethereum ETFs reported no flow changes, including those from Fidelity, Bitwise, 21Shares, Franklin, and both of Grayscale’s funds. The significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, especially from BlackRock, contrast with the more measured but positive inflows into Ethereum ETFs, indicating a broad-based accumulation trend with stronger momentum toward Bitcoin products.

September 25, 2024 07:09 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and certain of the Company’s senior executives. If you invested in Ford, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company. Investors have until October 7, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Ford securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is captioned Guzman v. Ford Motor Company, et al., No. 24-cv-12080. What is the Lawsuit About? Ford is an automotive manufacturing company that develops, delivers, and services a range trucks, cars, and luxury vehicles worldwide. The complaint alleges that during the relevant period, the company misrepresented its warranty reserves and that it had completed a sequence of organizational changes designed to ensure higher quality and lower costs. In truth, Ford was experiencing higher warranty costs, and the warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues in its vehicles. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford announced second quarter 2024 financial results (the “2Q24 Press Release”). The 2Q24 Press Release revealed that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” It was reported that, in the second quarter, Ford’s warranty and recall costs totaled $2.3 billion, $800 million more than the first quarter and $700 million more than a year ago. This news caused the price of Ford’s stock to decline by $2.51 per share, or over 18%, to close at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024.

Title: What to do if you left it late to start investing

You partied in your 20s and 30s. Or you had kids early and there was no money leftover. Or perhaps you got divorced and your partner took the lot. Bottom line: you’re late to start investing. Are you doomed to eat cat food in your retirement? To be grinding out another shift in your 80s as the oldest barista on the block? Probably not – provided you to take sufficient action now to turn things around. You’ll need to be more focussed than a younger saver though, without their head start. And maybe you should do a few things differently. Imagine you’ve woken up penniless after 20 years in a coma – long of hair, but short of time. The good news? You avoided selfies, Brexit, Covid, social media, and the last series of Game Of Thrones. However you also missed out on two decades of compound interest effortlessly growing your wealth. It’s a financial morality tale is as old as time spreadsheets, handed down from bloggers to Twitter pundits to TikTok influencers. Person A and Person B both start work in their early 20s. They earn the same salary. Person A notices there are a lot of old people around and begins to save, before they too get old. Person B imagines they’ll wear crop tops forever, eats out or orders in every day, spends everything, saves nothing, and reaches their 40s with little to show for it except for a pretty Instagram account. Run the numbers and Person A may already be headed for a comfortable retirement in their early 60s. But person B will need to save much more – and/or for much longer – just to catch-up. We’ve marvelled at the mathematical wonder of compound interest on Monevator before: Consider two investors: Captain Sensible and Captain Blithe. From the age of 25, Captain Sensible invests £2,000 per year in an ISA for 10 years until he is 35. At 35 he stops and never puts another penny into his fund again. Captain Sensible then leaves his nest egg untouched to grow until he hits age 65. He earns an average annual return of 8% and when he looks at his account 30 years later, he has £314,870 to play with. Captain Blithe, meanwhile, spends the lot between the ages of 25 to 35. Only when he hits 35 does he sober up and start tucking away £2,000 per year in his ISA. He keeps this up for the next 30 years until he reaches 65. Captain Blithe earns an average annual return of 8%, too. He ends up with £244,691. To recap: – Captain Sensible has invested a total of £20,000. – Captain Blithe has invested a total of £60,000. Yet Captain Sensible’s pile is worth over 28% more than the late-starting Captain Blithe’s – even though Sensible only invested a third of the amount. Compound interest takes a while to get interesting. All things equal, the earlier you start, the bigger your pension snowball will be by the time you’re old enough to start worrying about it. Of course hearing “you should have started earlier” isn’t any more welcome in personal finance than when you’re facing last dibs at a swingers’ party. There’s not much you can do about that now. What matters is how to best proceed. The good news is that beginning in 2012 most people have been auto-enrolled into pensions at work. But if this came too late for you – or if you didn’t put enough away – then start addressing things today. To catch up with swots like me who were aggressively saving by age 23, you have two broad routes: Clearly you can also pick-and-mix from these options. But know that all of them – from making your own lunch to save an extra tenner to gambling your life savings on a start-up – come with potential risks, rewards, and the chance of outright failure. Risky bets like putting real money into the likes of Bitcoin might well speed up your gains. But very often taking bigger or less orthodox risks will see you do worse. People try to get rich quick because it promises a shortcut, not because of any stellar track record. So you must consider the options for yourself and chart your own course. Just for the record, we strongly advise against robbing a bank! We’ve looked at devising your investing plan before, and also how much you can eventually withdraw from a portfolio. But before you get to that good stuff, you need to understand how far behind you are – and what investing success would look like. When it comes to retirement, success mostly means meeting your annual spending requirements with a low risk of running out of money. So you’ll want know how much you’ll need – realistically – to spend in your retirement years. A good way to get a handle on this number is to track your current spending. Use that as a base to figure out your budget, adjusting as seems appropriate. For instance, fewer work suits in retirement, but more gardening magazines. For a quick start though, see estimates from the likes of the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) and Which magazine. Here are the latest annual retirement income figures from the PLSA: Source: PLSA All figures like this are controversial (read a relevant Monevator comment thread for a taste) because our expectations are all different. So it’s always best to work out your own figures if you can. But for the purposes of a late-starter getting – well – started, ballpark figures will help you to zero-in on the scale of the challenge. From there you can estimate the size of retirement pot you’ll need to generate your desired income – in conjunction with your State Pension – and so what shortfall you face, especially as a later starter. You can always further refine your numbers as you go. So you’re on the wrong side of those Sensible Sarah versus Spendy Samuel spreadsheets? Let’s look at your main evasive action options, with links to further reading. By far your best remedial action is to put much more of your salary into your retirement pot. Ideally in the most tax-advantaged way. Every penny you save rather than spend today is more income for your future self. Also, by getting used to a leaner household budget now, you may be happier making do with less when you do retire. Crucially, your savings rate is one lever that’s mostly under your control – unlike say investment returns or how many healthy working years you have left. Remember there are young FIRE-seekers who are targeting retirement in their 30s or early 40s by saving hard and investing. To some extent you can flip that script, copying their tactics to catch-up late. Another sure winner. Every year you stay in paid employment is (a) an extra year to put savings away, (b) another year for your pension pot to compound, and (c) one less year in retirement that your pension has to pay for. Working for longer is probably not the most appealing prospect, but maybe you can make lemonade out of lemons and enjoy a late bloom at work? Or pivot to a second career? Our final years in work are usually extra-valuable because earnings are higher at the end of our careers than at the start. (Though professional footballers and lap-dancers may need to pursue a different tack). Normally we think it’s a good idea to save into both an ISA and a pension, given they are both tax-efficient wrappers. That’s because money in an ISA is much more accessible – which can be a huge benefit if you need it. But saving into a pension usually has a numerical edge due to tax-bracket arbitrage, salary sacrifice, and the tax-free lump sum you can withdraw on retirement. As a late starter, ISA savings may be a luxury you can’t afford. Run the numbers to see if you’re better-off throwing everything you can into your pension in your precious remaining work years. Maximise your employer’s pension match Your employer is obligated to chip in 3% of your qualifying earnings into your pension under the workplace pension rules. You must contribute 5% of your earnings (though this will cost you less in take home pay terms, after tax relief) for a total minimum contribution of 8%. Some employers are more generous though, and will match further contributions you make up to some limit. This is effectively a hike to your salary, albeit a pay raise that you must put into your pension. Contribution matching is an unbeatably cost-effective way to turbo-charge your savings rate, so you should almost always try to maximise your employer’s contributions. (Ideally via salary sacrifice). Locking more money away for decades probably won’t come easy if you’ve been a spender all your life. At least as an oldie you’re closer to the age where you’re allowed to get your hands on the money again… I hear you: no shit Sherlock: “Earn more money so I can save more money. Why didn’t I think of that?” Understood. But it’s worth a second reminder that how much you can feed into the hopper of your retirement investing engine is what will largely determine what you can spend in retirement. Maybe you planned to coast as a team leader rather than pushing hard to become a department head? Or to stay in a steady public sector job, rather than following your former colleagues into the tougher but more lucrative private sector? Obviously I don’t know your work situation. The permutations are endless. My point is just that easing up and retiring early isn’t on the horizon for you. So maybe knuckle down and work harder instead? Think of it as the bill coming due for all that spending you did 20 years ago… Okay, we’re heading into more controversial territory. But if you can stomach the extra volatility, then it might be worth running your portfolio a little hotter in the hope of bigger gains. What would this look like? For a passive investor it means a larger allocation to equities – such as your global tracker fund – and holding less in defensive assets like bonds, cash, and gold. For example, instead of the industry standard 60/40 portfolio split between equities and bonds, perhaps you’d go 75/25 instead. In theory, you can expect (but not be certain) to earn higher returns over the long term with a higher allocation to equities. The price you’ll pay will be a bumpier ride – and the potential for unlikely but possible lower final returns. (Here’s how that could happen). Remember: the market doesn’t care about your pension predicament nor your hopes for higher returns. Markets will certainly crash from time to time – in the worst case right as you retire – so do keep the riskiness of your portfolio under review as you get older and your pot grows. This is even riskier again, and definitely not for everyone. But if you find yourself in your early 40s, say, with inadequate pension savings when your ‘What About My Retirement?’ lightbulb goes off, then gunning for expected equity returns of 6-10% (hopefully) and tax relief in a pension may make more sense than paying off mortgage debt costing you 5%, say. There’s a panoply of options here, from choosing not to make overpayments on a traditional mortgage to switching to an interest-only option, to remortgaging to extend your mortgage term. All these paths have downsides. Such risks are what ‘pays’ for the potential upside from getting more money growing in your pension for longer. I’ve written a lot about these pros and cons before. And like I did then, I’ll stress again that paying down a mortgage ASAP is also a fine strategy – even for late starters. You can always go on a massive savings push once you’ve cleared the mortgage. Even if it’s not the financially optimal path, clearing your debts may be more motivational for you. That matters! I’d certainly urge you to reject any other kind of debt when borrowing to invest. Mortgages are low cost, they buy you somewhere to live, and they’re not marked-to-market, so you won’t face a sudden cash call during a stock market rout. Other kinds of debt are much more expensive and/or risky. Is amping up the conventional approach not moving the dial for you? Have you left it so late – or are your ambitions are so big – that you need more money than 20 years of diligent plodding can possibly deliver? Let’s run through a few more disruptive alternatives. Maybe you can’t hack the rat race anymore in your late 60s, but you could live with doing a few more years of lower-stress work? So-called ‘BaristaFIRE’ involves earning a bit through the sweat of your brow or muscles to top-up the income from your retirement portfolio. Like this you can survive with a smaller retirement portfolio. It takes a six-figure capital sum to generate £3,000 to £6,000 a year in retirement (a wide band to reflect the vast range of starting points, end points, and all the rest). So earning say £10,000 a year from part-time work can make up for a lot of missing invested money. But I probably wouldn’t work at a coffee shop or similar, if I’d been a high-earner in my main career and money was my main BaristaFire motivation. Most Monevator readers should instead pursue part-time or consulting work in the same vein as their lifelong profession. Doing so will maximise the kerching!-to-effort ratio. I believe everyone has a passion, hobby, aptitude, spare bedroom, or the free time to make £5,000 to £20,000 a year to supplement their main income – without the risks of quitting work to start a business. You may disagree, which is fine but is also perhaps why you’re behind on your retirement savings… The truth is options abound and I can’t list them all here. Be creative, test and iterate, and back yourself. The better pushback is that for a high-earner, it’s not worth messing around with side hustles for £10,000 a year when they are earning £100,000+ in their day job. And I agree. Such people are probably better off getting promotions or doing more overtime. But for the average earner on £35,000, say, the extra cashflow of £5,000 from a side-project can go straight to the bottom line to massively boost your pension savings. Of course if you want to make really big bucks then starting a proper business is one of the best ways. Perhaps the only way for most for us. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy – or in fact less than unlikely or near-impossible. (Beware survivorship bias!) The risks vary. If you’re trying to create a start-up software business, say, or to launch a restaurant, then your chances of success are low. Data suggests 90% of startups fail. But if you’re an established architect wanting to set up your own practice doing what you already do and with an existing book of contacts, for example, then there’s surely less risk of outright failure. Either way, your workload goes through the roof when you run your own business. By all means be an entrepreneur if it’s your life goal. But I wouldn’t quit work to start a business to try to fix my pension pot. Some active investors do beat the market. A handful even over the long-term. Warren Buffett, I’m looking at you. You’re not Warren Buffett and you haven’t got much chance of finding the next Buffett, either. But if you can – or if you have edge yourself and so can pick your own stocks to beat the market – then by definition this will increase your long-term returns. Perhaps there’s a case for investing into a few previously proven but out-of-favour active funds that might recover over the long-term, if you really want to roll the dice. Say with 25% of an otherwise passive equity allocation. Examples as I write could be investment trusts like Scottish Mortgage, Finsbury Growth & Income, Pershing Square Holdings, and RIT Capital Partners. These funds have all compounded money very well over the long-term but are more or less in a funk right now. And they all sit on big discounts. To be clear though, there’s zero guarantee that these or any other active funds will beat the market again in the future. And needless to say you should not take my top-of-head list as any sort of investment advice. Do your own research! Remember: you’ll probably do worse if you invest actively. You’re unlikely to beat the market and you’ll pay more in fees for trying. But there’s always a chance… so onto the list it goes. Some ways of making money sit between investing and running a business. Moves like investing into a family or friend’s franchise business, running a multi-unit buy-to-let portfolio via a limited company, or reserving property off-plan in the hope of flipping it for a profit later. These are idiosyncratic investments where the outcome will be about your aptitude – and luck – rather than what the S&P 500 does. Again, possibilities abound. I’d suggest looking at areas close to your own professional expertise. You might have some kind of edge or insight there. For example, if you’re a dentist then perhaps you know there’s a need for a new multi-practice building in your local area? You could be part of a consortium that gets it built and occupied. That sort of thing. Good luck! There’s no end of other high risk, high reward ‘opportunities’ out there. And yes – I’m lifting my fingers off the keyboard to put ‘opportunities’ into air quotes because one person’s reasoned speculation is another person’s reckless gamble. If not a borderline scam. Into this bucket we might put everything from punting on cryptocurrencies to extreme concentration into just a few company stocks (putting it all into nVidia, say) to investing more than a small percentage of your net worth into a handful of private or crowdfunded start-ups. I would define this category as anything where if a hundred of us have a stab, 90 of us will lose some or all our money – or at the least lag the market in the case of listed shares – but 5-10% might see huge returns. So as the man once said: “Do you feel lucky, punk?” Personally, I would again at most ring-fence a portion of my assets for such antics. Maybe a maximum 10% allocation. That way if I did pick a winner it would meaningfully move the dial, but if – as is most likely – it goes tits up then I’m not too far further behind on my goals. If you say “No way, not touching this stuff with a bargepole” then I can only applaud your good sense. We all know other ways to get rich that aren’t written about on worthy websites like Monevator. And as an upstanding citizen I don’t recommend any of them. Besides the moral issues, do you really want to risk your reputation or your liberty for the sake of a slightly comfier retirement? Perhaps marrying rich is the exception. But I’m the wrong person to ask about marriage, as I see mostly risks… Maybe read some Jane Austen! For some of our regular readers, this post will have seemed like one long ‘obviously’. Such people began saving and investing when they were very young maybe, or they’re on the other side of work already and enjoying the fruits of their labours. Good for them! However I do regularly hear from people with proper jobs and responsibilities who’ve no idea where they stand or what to do about their pensions – and they’re sometimes only ten to 20 years from retirement. If that’s you, then don’t panic. Follow the links in this article, learn more, and begin to create your plan. For most non-investment crazed would-be retirees, I’d suggest stick mostly (or entirely) to the sober tactics, with maybe an added side hustle. Beyond that you could perhaps make a modest 5-10% allocation to a few out-of-favour trusts or to very carefully chosen long-shot bets in the hope – but not expectation – of faster gains. But you must figure out what works best for you. Who knows? You might even have fun doing so. I’m sure I’ve missed out a few possibilities above.

I imagine there are plenty of people who look no further than the headline salary when considering moves, rather than the wider benefits package. Certainly worth paying attention to in debates about public vs private sector. @tetromino — Good point, I should surface that explicitly. Will add a bit now before sending out the email. Thanks! For the love of God, if you must eat pet food in your dotage, go with dog food, not cat food. Have you seen what they put in cat food? > But person B will need to save much more – and/or for much longer – just to catch-up. More, yes. They will probably be earning rather more than their younger self. If they can reduce their outgoings there’s more tax they’ll be saving of what goes into the pension. Anyway, I’ll stand up as the poster child for the Johnny-come-lately non-recommended way. Barista-FIRE was what I was frightened of. It was a rough experience for three years, and I had good luck to be doing it after a market crash. And I survived/eventually thrived over a decade of active investing, though arguably tutored by Monevator in the early days. So under some circumstances you can get there from here. While I did manage to avoid debt (apart from mortgage) from my early twenties, it absolutely beats me how you get to save money when you’re young. Perhaps living in London through my twenties was my mistake, and perhaps living away from home was another – it was looked down on in the same way as Thatcher’s view on buses and how folk play the mating game under their parents’ roof puzzles me. The general point remains. Young people just don’t usually have much spare money – they’re earning less at the start of their careers and their outgoings are higher as they establish themselves. I didn’t start saving for a pension until I was 29 and I cleared the workforce in my early fifties, because I couldn’t stand what it had become. Re investing, think key point is just make a start. Initially it may seem pointless but get the saving going on an automatic basis and take any employer pension contribution you can. Biggest risk is divorce. Choose your partner carefully ( or just do without). My charm and good looks meant I swerved that one but boy have I seen some financial casualties. Some were emotionally upset too. However old age care fees are just an apocalyptic horseman…have an extra £300k for those. This is me at age 49. Was always conservative with money but on divorce found myself starting over. Its a mix of investing hard (over 30% of income) and running a 85/15 equities/bond portfolio using SIPP and ISA. The result is I’m back on track with 11 years to go (I have a serious illness so want to retire early). The risks of a poorly timed downturn are clear though – been doing a lot of research on sequence risks recently. It shows it is doable though, and have to say Monevator really helps. If you’ve left it ‘too late’ to invest then it’s never too late to turn that around. Do what you can. But if it’s still not enough, then how can you make what you do have go further? Easiest way is geo arbitrage. The UK is a high cost of living location. It’s a relatively rich (but IMO still deeply dysfunctional) nation with a lot of poor people and a few rich ones. And when GDP per capita is around £35,000 p.a. then nothing is cheap and everyone wants a piece of what’s yours. So why not just up sticks altogether and move to where your money will buy you 2 to 3 times as much? If you think that you can’t do that because of your relatives/ friends/ the language barrier, then of course you can. Do it for yourself and for the life you deserve, but have been afraid to reach for. Even in Europe, there are still Low Cost of Living locations where tax is minimal and where £100k will buy you a fine house and a little over £20k p.a. will give you a decent standard of living for a couple. Check out the example of Bosnia. Totally under the radar: https://youtu.be/vxVuFFAhHsQ?feature=shared And that channel/website has plenty of other ideas too: https://thewanderinginvestor.com/blog/ As does this one here: https://youtu.be/KXf38mC3puE?feature=shared And here: https://youtu.be/ebIzq3-rDSw?feature=shared The other thing you could do is accept you’ve messed it up, put £2880 in your new borns JSIPP and at least they won’t suffer the same fate? So who do we know who has happily relocated to Bosnia? I’m highly suspicious of the geo-arbitrage is easy brigade. Like the cost of living is the only variable in quality of life. Someone would actually have to have done it in order for me to take them seriously. But in that scenario, I would be all ears! @Rhino: what about the millions of Brits who retired to Spain and Portugal since the 1970s? No longer such LCOL destinations now, for sure, but just after the fall of Salazar’s successor and the death of Franco in 1974 and 1975 respectively they very definitely were. Do you really think we just happen to be born into the best overall retirement location we could have been born into? I doubt it. Re: Geo-arbitrage, let’s not forget the more modest option of doing it semi-local, as exemplified by one of our readers: https://monevator.com/fire-side-chat-domestic-geo-arbitrage-made-it-possible/ @Ermine — Thanks for chiming in, was hoping you would! You are indeed UK personal finance’s poster-man for starting late and getting out. 🙂 Absolutely, I’d talk to one of them to get the lowdown. Funnily enough my uncle is currently moored up in Portugal semi permanently. In a similar vein to my JSIPP comment I’m trying to talk my kids into marrying Norwegians. @Delta Hedge #6 Easiest way is geo arbitrage. The UK is a high cost of living location. It’s a relatively rich (but IMO still deeply dysfunctional) nation with a lot of poor people and a few rich ones. London is a HCOL location. Fixed that for you 😉 OK, fair enough, a few other UK cities, which tend to be peopled by highish paid young professionals, Oxbridge, Bristol. Those poor people ted to reduce the COL somewhat. Avoid the extremes, natch. I’m not knocking geo-arbitrage, but it should be said that it’s harder as you get older, and while barista-FIRE sucks ending up Billy-no-mates in an alien culture where you don’t really grasp the lingo probably sucks in a different way. It’s not just your personal finances where it’s harder to change things as you get older. I have been plugging away at Duolingo French for nearly a year, while there is some progress and I am probably ahead of my O level French progress is glacial. I can sort of follow the radio news, interviews with real people still sound like line noise to me. Sometimes you gotta do the best with what you have to hand, I agree, but life is about more than money, it is also about your setting. I’m sure Bosnia is charming, but geo-arbitrage works within the UK too – and particularly within the US. There’s some argument it’s worth moving after you retire, since proximity to high-paying work and/or good transport connections to it do raise the cost of living massively. Also high population densities and work opportunities are usually detrimental to natural beauty. I agree wholeheartedly with the theory of “Do you really think we just happen to be born into the best overall retirement location we could have been born into? I doubt it.” , it’s just that in practice you are also shaped across your lifetime by where you live. Arguably the best time to deploy geo-arbitrage is in your twenties when you have least baggage. Reminds me of the book, ‘the almost nearly perfect people’ by Michael Booth. Synopsis is that the scandi countries regularly top the bill in happiness surveys and quality of life etc. but this is from the perspective of the native population, with the ex-pat experience being somewhat different and not so rosy. It’s worth a read actually. FIRE blogs also peppered with failed emigration experiments – grass is generally greener type fallacies. I get the feeling successful geo arbitrage is quite a tough one to pull off in practice, especially, as ermine notes, for those of more advanced years. Would agree, domestic geo arbitrage a much simpler trick. @ermine – I suspect that Duolingo will turn out to be the Sinclair C5 to Tesla’s Model S. What the UK’s many language barrier challenged potential geo arbitrageurs are waiting for is a fusion of Google Translate with the successor to Google Glass and the Apple Vision Pro. Imagine a fully wearable and weatherproof rechargeable device which takes spoken words and written characters in any language and translates them immediately, seamlessly and automatically into any other. And it needs to retail for below £1,000. This is far more near term likely I think than Tesla’s level 5 FSD EV ‘robotaxi’, yet alone Musk’s mad Mars’ plans. The Babel Fish of Douglas Adams’ lore may be near to hand: https://youtu.be/iuumnjJWFO4?si=0TFOkETmWgqTfHSN @Delta Hedge Imagine a fully wearable and weatherproof rechargeable device which takes spoken words and written characters in any language and translates them immediately, seamlessly and automatically into any other. No thanks. I don’t routinely carry a mobile phone with me, never mind a full-body robo-suit. All Watched Over By machines Of Loving Grace. Curtis, not Brautigan > And it needs to retail for below £1,000 Yup. For that price it’ll whisper advertising sweet nothings to you all the time, I’m sure, wraparound Facebook. A metaverse, indeed. Each to their own. I am so old I remember what the term IRL means 😉 And I read Asimov’s The Feeling of Power in my teens. You are more than welcome to say OK Boomer but if that’s the price of entry I think it illustrates the problem of geo-arbitrage for those at the RE end of the journey. @ermine: ideally it’ll all fit neatly inside a jacket pocket and comprise a) wireless ear buds with microphones to take the foreign spoken words and play it to you in English, b) glasses with LED sized cameras embedded to OCR scan foreign written words and display the English translation on the inside of the lenses and c) your mobile phone which you’ll just speak into and its speaker will then translate into the foreign language, in your own voice should you chose. It might sound far fetched but the only piece of Star Trek tech which came to pass (only more so) was the Communicator, which became the mobile phone, and now the smart phone. And on the subject of wrap around Facebook, this from Investing.com only today: “Meta climbed Wednesday after debuting its first augmented reality glasses at its annual connect event”. The future is closer than you think. As Dylan said back in day, ‘the times they are a changin’. @DH (13) I wouldn’t be too quick to knock Duolingo. I have studied German slowly and painfully the old-fashioned way over the years. I am involved in a German conversation group and have been impressed on more than one occasion by the competence of newcomers who have only learned via Duolingo. @DavidV: These investors think Duolingo could be one of the best investments out there: https://open.substack.com/pub/atmosinvest/p/top-4-favorite-stocks-to-own-forever Then again, since subscribing to the free tier for a score of investment Substacks, I’m now daily bombarded with ‘the 25 best companies to hold forever’ type lists, which if I added them up probably more or less make up the investment universe and thereby inadvertently make the case for index tracking 😉 You need to frighten people into saving for their old age. Just ask them “Do you want to reach your sixties still dependent on other people paying for your clothes?” That should do the trick. On taking on more risk, leverage + active investing, this is double edged: – Using volatility and permanent loss of capital as metrics here, moving up the risk scale from index tracking equities to say single name stocks or sectors and regional bets usually doesn’t work or more pros would do it and more retail investors would lag less. – But Consumer Staples and Low Volatility stocks as groups do benefit it seems from more return per unit of risk, defying the efficient frontier. Historically Private Equity has outperformed on this measure but that seems not to be the case now. – Leveraging a low risk asset can deliver better risk to return than moving to invest in a higher risk asset. You really need cost of carry to be low to negative – i.e. the cost of finance is less than the net (post any tax payable) paid out yield on the assets brought. – Contrarianism tends to be a fail but sometimes it wins. But you have both to be right when others are wrong and in a way where you get an additional net return. This is harder than it sounds. For every successful contrarian you do hear about there are so many more who failed who you never hear from. – Then again there are always contrarian opportunities. From the Daily Telegraph’s money pages just this morning “Had you invested £100 in an index of emerging market shares in September 2009, you would have £121 today. The same amount focused on China itself would be worth just £95. Had you instead put your faith in a global stock market recovery over the next decade and a half you would have grown your £100 to £324. And if you had simply bet that America would bounce back to regain its economic leadership, your £100 investment would today be worth £539.” And, for balance here, our own @TI in the MV piece “A buying opportunity has emerged in Emerging Markets” said (back on 11 December 2013): “The S&P 500 has beaten the iShares emerging markets ETF by more than 30% in the year to-date.Will that stellar level of outperformance continue? Maybe. Will it be replayed every year for the rest of the decade? I’ll go out on a limb and say: Not on your nelly”. Back then 11 years ago I nodded to myself in agreement with that as how could the US just keep outperforming year after year after year? But it did. In and around 2012 there were actually a couple of pieces out there saying that US tech was quite cheap compared to then recent (1995-2000 and 2004-7) historical valuations and its growth prospects. If you’d gone with that sentiment; then, from 30th December 2011 through to 3rd January 2022 (buying the NASDAQ index on the last trading day of the earlier year, and selling on the first trading day of the latter), you would have made 19.79% annually in dollar terms, and more still in sterling. So, being a contrarian (in that example case, a tech uber bull) can pay off, it’s just statistically that it tends not to at the aggregate level. @ermine (#3) “For the love of God, if you must eat pet food in your dotage, go with dog food, not cat food. Have you seen what they put in cat food?” Why pet food at all? Even buying in bulk, the dog food we get (just to be completely clear – for our dog) is just over a £1 a tin, whereas Aldi baked beans are 41p, tinned soups 61p, and a jacket potato 24p. OK, Aldi’s dog food is a bit cheaper than what we buy (~50p in multipacks), but our dog’s innards have become a bit fussy as he has aged. Not wanting to take away from your point about jumping ship to a better paid job, but I’m not convinced that the poor public sector, prosperous private sector schtick is still true. Thanks to outsourcing the line between the two has become very murky. The people delivering services are often agency staff while the office staff are permies on gold plated DB pensions. To boost your pension it might make more sense to move from private to public. RE: Emerging markets versus the US, oof, yes, but I’d take that side again. Especially as I didn’t forecast the US market wouldn’t beat EM, I just didn’t think it’d continue to thrash it. Which was wrong, but rational — then and now I’d argue. I’ve mentioned before that I published elsewhere on the Internet in 2011 or 2012 a two-part series on why investors shouldn’t write-off the US stock market, especially tech shares. It is a massive ongoing gripe for me that these articles (along with most others on that site) are no longer available. Not just for bragging rights (though there is that) but because I’d love to link to it to show that — hard as it is to believe theser days — there was a time when the mighty US market was out of fashion, and it wasn’t even that long ago! I look at markets today and I too struggle to see the tech-lite Rest of World keeping up with US exceptionalism. But then I struggle even more to imagine another near-15 year winning streak for the US. Doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen of course — there are underlying reasons why the US has done so well, especially in tech — but as we’ve discussed before there’s usually a medium-term Ying and Yang to US versus the rest of the world’s equities (albeit with the US outpacing the field long-term). Re: DuoLingo, another shareholder here! I have a small position that’s better than doubled and every week I chant the name ‘Bessembinder ‘ three times and will myself to hold onto it. 😉 Nice new interview with the CEO here: https://sherwood.news/business/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-q-and-a/ @Azamino – You could well be right — as I alluded to in the article I can hardly get into even broad brush discussions for earning potential in different industry sectors, let along people’s specific careers. I think your helpful comment reinforces that people looking to catch-up need to take a holistic view of what they’re trying to achieve with their pension, and what the best opportunities are for *them* specifically. 🙂 @TI “…I published elsewhere on the Internet in 2011 or 2012 a two-part series on why investors shouldn’t write-off the US stock market, especially tech shares. It is a massive ongoing gripe for me that these articles (along with most others on that site) are no longer available.” Have you tried the Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/)? I find that site extremely useful for finding deleted material (or deleted domains). @DH accepting that one shouldn’t always infer the general from the particular, I am disturbed both by the capacity for AI to bullshit on all cylinders along with the tendency for AI fans to believe in its ability to transform the world. I have an installation of BirdnetPi in my back garden. It’s quite successfuly identified that there are birds in the garden, it has achieved 100% fail, confidently (> 80%) IDing this exotic crew, I’d have twitchers on the lawn by now 😉 I have put the real IDs in brackets, formed from listening to the recordings AI used to identify: Northern Slaty-Antshrike (robin alarm) Lark-like Bunting (robin alarm) Common Poorwill (some finch followed by magpie) Lark-like Bunting (robin song) Indian Roller (jackdaw) Two things are wrong here. One is these are acceptably clear recordings, some finch is my lack of detailed knowledge but the others are certs. This damn thing knows the lat/lon of where it lives, if I went to a pub with a bunch of people who had the slightest knowledge I’d be laughed out the door claiming the original list. I haven’t got the faintest idea of what Tensorflow Lite is which seems to be the AI guts of this, but the breathtaking confidence in total error is quite impressive, particularly given prior knowledge. I will piddle with this to see if it can be sharpened up, but the fundamental Dunning-Kruger problem is one I’ve seen in a lot of AI. It’s there in the AI ‘assistance’ Wordpress offers, which can totally change the meaning of a sentence with blithe assurance this is better. I used perplexity to try and see if two electric blanket controllers were equivalent. It hemmed and hawed, I read a page of random waffle and was none the wiser; its greatest service was locating a picture of the connectors from which I inferred it was worth a go, and it worked. So apart from the Isaac Asimov angle, I’ll stick with Duolingo, because from these experiences I infer using an AI babelfish is probably a great way to hurl vile abuse at random strangers in foreign countries, which you won’t realise until you get your face rearranged or a pantechnicon arrived with three tons of rice pudding when you thought you ordered a couple of bags of sugar. There’s a fundamental problem with whizzy tools in the hands of noobs. If you have at least some idea of what the result should look like, you have some change of switching it off if it’s chuntering out gibberish. I’m sure people will fix some of this in time, but in the meantime, emigrants/expats/whatever, learn the lingo to at least a serviceable degree. Similarly for the culture- if you are going to some Arab countries then cover up and lay off the hooch, in Thailand don’t insult the king etc etc. @Curlew — Yes, curiously the whole URL hasn’t been archived, which is odd because it wasn’t a small website. I wonder if the site’s owner somehow barred their site from being archived legally or via robots.txt or something. We’d also have the issue of my ‘coming out’ (which if it ever happens will be the biggest anti-climax since the Segway, but which I’d rather do deliberately versus a random link). Moot anyway as the link’s not there. :-\ @ermine: buggy AI is going to be a much bigger issue to begin with than the “Open the pod bay doors HAL” scenario and, even if and when that scenario arrives, it’s then bad human actors misusing AI that’ll be the bigger risk, and not the creation of a SkyNet. At the moment both chat bots and LLM assisted search are pretty crappy tbh. OTOH, there’s some impressive stuff going on with protein folding and with combining neural nets and LLMs. Google Deep Mind was able to crack International Maths Olympiad problems for example and win silver. Already some firms are firing human coders for machine written software. However, it’s not where things are now, but where they will be, that really matters. It’s overhyped now for sure, but writing off machine learning today would be like saying that the internet was going nowhere commercially in 1994. I suspect that there’s a big market for usable, portable, real time translate. It just has to integrate seamlessly with existing (mobile phone) and future (Meta / Apple / Google glasses and ear buds) consumer tech. @TI: I’ve got a feeling now that yours may be the articles which I was referring to above (“around 2012 there were actually a couple of pieces out there saying that US tech was quite cheap”)! Cheap growth beats cheap value and even cheap quality IMO. So you were prescient. EM and European underperformance is rather perplexing. EMs got bid up in the run up to 2008, but they had already taken a massive pummeling by 2013. Likewise, Europe was in the doldrums from the Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain (the ‘PIGS’) debt crisis, and Cyprus was in the frame. Those markets didn’t exactly look overvalued back then, and they really should have put in a much better performance from 2014 to date. It’s not just relative underperformance to the US generally and American Mega Cap Tech particularly, but a rather poor absolute level of return, especially from China. Small caps and small value has also underperformed by a historically unusual margin, and over an exceptionally long time frame. I don’t give financial advice. If (and thank God I’m not in this position) I were to be a late starter to investment then, for me, I guess that I’d be thinking then about taking more concentration risk and a contrarian active bet on mean reversion. That strategy could, of course, easily blow up. But if, counterfactually, I was to find myself that far behind and with so little time left until I expected to retired, then I suspect that I’d then feel compelled to try something radical. That’s not the best way to invest as fear and desperation cloud judgment as much as greed and hubris. @Alan S #20 I wasn’t advocating eating pet food – there was a novel Monevator once recommended that had ‘the dog food years’. It’s more TA we need to worry about, he used to favour dog food in times of fiscal distress but I fear he has a darker view of the financial future since he has cited eating cat food as the marker of epic fail in a portfolio 😉 @DeltaHedge #26 But if, counterfactually, I was to find myself that far behind and with so little time left until I expected to retired, then I suspect that I’d then feel compelled to try something radical. That’s not the best way to invest as fear and desperation cloud judgment as much as greed and hubris. Worked for me 😉 I read this dark transmission on here and at the end of that month had a meeting with a line manager and saw the writing on the wall. I was not the Right Stuff and was wasn’t prepared to do what was necessary to become it. Had I know that line manager was desperate because he had a new baby with his new second wife I would have used that against him, it explained the intensity of the discussion since he needed bodies. Later line managers were puzzled as to exactly why I inferred a one-way ticket. But once you emotionally decide the only way out is to pull the big red ejector handle, you can’t stop the hand reaching for that sucker. I exited the middle class and lived on almost minimum wage for three years, a damn sight eaiser if you own your house with a vestigial mortgage. The difference not spent attracted 40%/32% tax win which is more than that percentage on the amount foregone. It’s not the greatest amount of fun I’ve ever had. But as we observed in a Skype call with some ex-Imperial guys, the privilege of owning your own time and deciding what you will do with this day never gets old, even after a decade. Never underestimate the financial firepower of a desperate old git in the endgame at the peak of his earning power. I have been cynical about the value of compound interest, yes, I’ve seen it but only a decade after retiring. CI plus passive investment expected returns is ion drive, not Saturn V. I did have luck on my side inasmuch as the reason my job went bad was partly because the markets had been shot up in the global financial crisis. That is a terribly good time to start investing, market timing with knobs on. You didn’t have to get much right then, but you did need to start, and I did. I didn’t really expect it to work, but I could recognise a chance worth taking Your FIRE journey was an inspiration to us all @ermine 🙂 Ion drives beat chemical rockets every time. Investing Saturn V’s can blow up on the launch pad like Putin’s recent failed Sarmat ICBM test. Late to the game invesors who are looking to try and play catch up before their retirement beckons should first check out the outcome of the 1969-70 Australian mining bubble or the fate of once all conquering, and much pumped and dumped, alt-coins like Verge/XVG, whose rollercoaster ride Coindesk summaries thus: “On Dec. 23, 2017, the coin hit highs of 30 cents, a staggering 1,384,300% increase from its all-time low…on Feb. 5, 2015. In the wake of the crypto winter of 2018 and 2019, the coin fell to as low as just under 1 cent in March 2020. It wasn’t until 2021, when Bitcoin skyrocketed again, that XVG reached 6 cents in May. The crypto market crashed shortly after… The coin never fully recovered, and by June 2022 had fallen to $0.004. Yet, even that low price marks a staggering 188,149% increase from XVG’s all-time low of $0.000002 on Feb. 5, 2015.” It’s still at $0.004 today, now nearly 7 years on from, and 98.7% down from, its 2017 peak. And in the crypto winter of 2018-19 it was actually at one point down 99.4% from the All Time Highs. It was at that peak that it first attracted attention and then drew in the newbies, as if attracted to a naked flame. The results thereafter were all too predictable, and indeed predicted at the time. I visited a beet sugar refinery once and discovered a fact that took my interest. What do you think they do with the protein from the beets? Goldfish food! Bugger cat or dog food, eat vegan goldfish food. [Correction: Spotted that Coindesk have messed up their maths. The lowest (2015) XVG price was actually $0.00002167 (so they’ve erroneously added an extra 0), which in turn means that the 188,149% figure should be 18,814.9%. The cycle low is $0.001427, which is more than 99.4% off the ATH, which elsewhere is more accurately given as $0.29725. The point remains, crypto is nuts, and alt-coins are a no touch for most (/sensible) investors]. Great article as always 🙂 I started actively investing when I was around 45, after taking a closer look at my work pension and then wondering what I was going to when I retire and it looked scary to me. I started with increasing my pension contributions and sorted out my monthly budget, which then started me looking at ISAs & passive investing with the help of this great blog and a more active portfolio using Investment Trusts. I’m 51 now with no debt other than what’s left of my Mortgage, I can at least see a path now and feel a lot more confident in taking a little more risk I still think I’ll be working when I’m 63 ish I think with a view to working part time. Hopefully by then I’ll have paid off the house When I see examples like the Captain Sensible one I kick myself for having missed out. Then I remember that I did do some moderately stashing of things away around about 29-30 but the problem was gains were eaten up by crap adviser charges (I think you had to go with a broker to buy a S&S PEP at the time) and mediocre funds so got nothing like the 8% example. Plus life was happening so I didn’t do it consistently and did the usual getting spooked by poor sequence of returns when it came to putting more in. The folly of yoof and all that. Only in my more reccent & more focused years been able to access almost nil cost platforms and the real low OCF funds/ETFs to plump up returns and really get past the worry aspect. Only started seriously investing late in day, unfortunately, a few years ago due to getting fingers burnt some 30 -40 years ago so consequently put me off Long story but medical conditions forced me to finish work early around 50 – had started in my earlier 40’s I think many people over estimate what they’ll need, how well they are likely to be – regardless of any healthy lifestyle and how long they’ve got left – which is likely better than not enough but puts you under major stress at times, many think they’ll be running around at 90 or 100 when actually not that many are – and if still alive certainly not spending much (unless paying for your care home costs) or getting out much. Holidays/cars likely a distant memory – that’s if you still have a memory at all I know they are investing focussed but many finance blogs I have read on this subject make light of, and seem to suggest, an early death is quite the advantage in that the portfolio won’t run out (regardless of withdrawal rate) Once you are faced with that prospect I can assure you that your pot isn’t your main concern and you would much rather live longer with not so much rather than vice versa As some others said I don’t find geo arbitrage (or in plain english “moving to somewhere cheaper to live”) always much of a good option either for most -tends to be those in later life or at least middle aged that would consider it and more often those looking to do an “escape to the country” type thing as generally by then had enough of cities and prefer a quieter existence But this is also when medical conditions tend to crop up, as mine and many others I know did – then you need to have medical facilities/main hospitals with A&E at hand Not always a period of your life when you want to be uprooting to miles away – which can often be the case if you require a large decrease in property costs – and having to start again, maybe no family around Also you can only achieve a large saving on property cost if you are already living in a fairly highly priced area but if you live in north then good luck with making much from that (unless you are also downsizing by a lot) I’ve known many come back as well after moving to Aus/NZ/other parts of UK – as the grass is not always greener as they believed it was – especially if you don’t really know anybody there Also when older you tend to delight in moving house with all it’s hassle and ramifications about as much as going to Glastonbury every year I agree with others divorce is a big risk and sometimes don’t even have to be married – the number of people suggesting to invest monies in partner’s ISA/pension if used all your allowances to save tax seems quite ludicrous to me, no matter how safe you think your relationship is – people can change markedly over time and even the safest can and do go sour. Also what about if they die first and not married and maybe no will – that would go to their family – not to you but some do it – presumably think it won’t happen to them – is that the “not me gov” bias? ^ @dearieme 30 Was it Wissington Sugar Factory? Great article. One piece of advice is focus on where you are investing as much as how much do you put into a pension. Too many workplace pensions have a ‘default’ allocation which typically are not the best for performance. Invest passively, diversity your portfolio, keep charges low and that should put you in good stead. Don’t try to chase todays winners (which are tomorrows losers).

Title: Sam Altman believes wars will be fought over AI unless there's massive spending on infrastructure. But that comes with a cost.

In a Monday blog post, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman argued that massive investment in AI infrastructure is key to market dominance — and avoiding global conflict. "If we want to put AI into the hands of as many people as possible, we need to drive down the cost of compute and make it abundant (which requires lots of energy and chips)," Altman wrote. "If we don't build enough infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over, and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people." While promoting the development of AI infrastructure is the new focus of industry leaders like Altman, researchers on the technology's social, environmental, and economic impacts told Business Insider that the development of the data centers and hardware systems needed to achieve artificial general intelligence or superintelligence will cost far more than money. Representatives for OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The new hot topic in artificial intelligence is infrastructure — investing in it, planning a massive expansion of computing power, and creating the data centers needed to develop the technology at scale. Last week, Microsoft and BlackRock announced the launch of a $30 billion fund to "enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth." Earlier this month, the White House hosted a roundtable with AI infrastructure leaders from around the country — including Altman and executives from Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Anthropic, among others — to "discuss steps to ensure the United States continues to lead the world in AI" and ensure the tech's development is aligned with "national security, economic, and environmental goals." While some experts are cautiously optimistic about AI, others pointed to pitfalls in the rapid build-up of infrastructure. Alex de Vries, an economist and the founder of Digiconomist, a platform dedicated to exposing the unintended consequences of digital trends, told Business Insider the current conversation on AI infrastructure is focused on the development of large-scale data centers, with industry insiders trying to convince national governments to greenlight expansion — despite unclear benefits. "It costs a whole lot of resources, while data centers don't generate that many benefits for the local economy — not too many jobs, very little other business activity because no one has to be near a data center," de Vries said. "So for now, the trade-off is really bad." The return on investment in artificial intelligence is increasingly murky. With companies like OpenAI and others preparing to spend over $1 trillion on artificial intelligence in the coming years, a June Goldman Sachs report asked the question: "Are we spending too much for too little reward?" Proponents of the technology argue it could eventually help save lives by revolutionizing the healthcare industry or, as the United Nations climate technology website suggests, "scaling up transformative climate solutions for mitigation and adaptation action in developing countries." However, chatbots and image generators have been the most publicly celebrated advancements in AI from the major Big Tech players — and errors created by AI-generated content have been well documented. In recent earnings calls, executives from Microsoft and Alphabet have repeatedly fended off investors' questions about when to expect a return on their AI expenditures. Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside, told Business Insider that, despite Altman's prediction in his blog post that we could be "a few thousand days" from an AI superintelligence, he's not optimistic that we're as close as Altman says we are — and he argued OpenAI's reliance on large language models is not the right path to get there. Rather than a single model that can do it all, Ren said he believes the industry needs to focus on smaller, more specialized models that require fewer resources and can be built to handle more precise tasks. "I think we need to shift the way we build AI, not just rely on bigger and bigger models," Ren said. "This is not really sustainable or scalable." Both de Vries and Ren said that beyond the financial costs, ensuring AI infrastructure is developed at the scale industry players like Altman seek comes with massive environmental costs. "If you're talking about large-scale data centers, they are going to be consuming a huge amount of power and a huge amount of water," de Vries said. He noted that data centers consume tons of water for their cooling systems — some of which evaporates, so it cannot be reused. Electricity consumption also skyrockets, driving up demand and increasing reliance on fossil fuels despite the industry's use of renewable energy certificates (RECs). Wind and solar companies generate RECs for each unit of energy they create and then sell them. Buyers of RECs can then say they source renewable energy, even if they're using power from nonrenewable sources. "The environmental consequences of a big surge in power demand are typically very, very bad — way, way worse than is being acknowledged by the Big Tech companies," de Vries said. That's not to mention what Cary Coglianese, a professor of law and political science and the director of an interdisciplinary program focused on research on effective regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, describes as AI's impact on "social ordering." While Coglianese describes himself as "cautiously optimistic" about the benefits of artificial intelligence, he said even if we achieve advanced uses for the tech, the feat will come with "trade-offs." "Any human endeavor that involves an optimization challenge can be made more efficient through artificial intelligence," Coglianese said. "Some of those uses can be good, like finding malignancies on MRI scans — a great use of AI technology — but we'll also be making much more efficient weapon systems, or automating weapon systems, or creating tools that can oppress people that can be made more, quote-unquote, 'efficient.'" In his blog post, Altman writes that the dawn of what he calls the Intelligence Age comes "with very complex and extremely high-stakes challenges." "It will not be an entirely positive story," Altman wrote. "But the upside is so tremendous that we owe it to ourselves, and the future, to figure out how to navigate the risks in front of us." Altman didn't mention the current negative social impacts AI is already causing — such as deepfakes infiltrating our political system, a proliferation of AI-generated revenge porn, and workers being replaced as companies increasingly invest in the tech. "There's a real disconnect between where the world is today socially and where it is technologically — and that's something that the technologists and the techno-optimists can often overlook," Coglianese told Business Insider. "I'm cautiously optimistic too, but we have to recognize that until we have a social ordering that's different than it is, a new technology won't be some magic elixir that will transform the globe into a utopia."

Title: Could The Newly Launched Bitcoin ETF Options Propel BTC Price To The Moon? Bitwise’s Exec Thinks So

One of the exciting developments from last Friday was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) greenlight for listing and trading of physically settled options tied to BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Bitwise’s head of alpha strategies has suggested that these products could set the stage for enormous upside volatility in the BTC price. On Sept. 20, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave its regulatory blessing to the Nasdaq exchange to list options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) — marking the first time the top Wall Street financial cop has greenlighted options tied to spot Bitcoin funds for U.S. customers. Listing spot BTC options on regulated US exchanges, where the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) protects traders against counterparty risk, represents “the most monumental advancement possible” for cryptocurrency markets, Jeff Park, Bitwise Asset Management’s head of alpha strategies, observed in a Friday tweet. “For the first time, Bitcoin will have a regulated market where the OCC protects clearing members from counterparty risks,” Park explained. “This means Bitcoin’s synthetic notional exposure can grow exponentially without the [default] risks that have kept investors at bay.” Notably, Park argued that Bitcoin’s unique attributes combined with options could deliver massive potential for upside volatility. The first is Bitcoin’s “volatility smile,” depicting the willingness of derivatives traders to pay high premiums for both exposure to and protection from heavy upside or downside price volatility. This gives Bitcoin options “negative Vanna,” meaning the asset’s volatility soars alongside its spot price, making Bitcoin’s upside “explosively recursive.” “A negative Vanna gamma squeeze acts like a refueling rocket,” the expert added. The other Bitcoin characteristic is its capped supply. As fresh leverage flows into the market, new coins cannot be printed to accommodate it — an anomaly that has typically limited the peak of explosive meme stocks such as Gamestop (GME). While there are markets for other commodities like oil and natural gas, the Bitwise executive said they trade more closely with the futures market because they have expiration dates. They’re also vulnerable to supply manipulation by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other bodies.“Bitcoin ETF options are the first time the financial world will see regulated leverage on a perpetual commodity that is truly supply constrained,” he summarized. “Things will likely get wild. In such scenarios, regulated markets may shut down.” Remarkably, Bitcoin is completely decentralized and can’t be shut down, which he believes “will add even more fuel to the fire.” “It’s going to be unbelievably fantastic.” Meanwhile, other top analysts expect the SEC to approve options trading on other spot Bitcoin ETFs “in short order.”

Title: Meet the ex-Goldman wealth advisor who quit to solve Britain’s £567 billion gender investment gap
URL: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/ex-goldman-director-quit-to-solve-uks-gender-investment-gap-.html
Time Published: 2024-09-25T07:08:20Z
Full Content:
Ayesha Ofori is a former Goldman Sachs wealth advisor who quit her high-profile job to resolve Britain's gender wealth gap, after realizing she had spent her career making rich men even richer. Ofori is the 40-year-old founder and CEO of female-focused financial investment platform, Propelle, which launched on Wednesday. The app-based platform offers various investment options like funds from Vanguard, Blackrock and HSBC. Propelle has raised over £1.2 million (around $1.6 million) in pre-seed funding and is backed by Google, which invested $100,000 into the platform, Ofori told CNBC Make It in an interview. Other investors range from Stefan Bollinger, Julius Baer CEO and former Goldman executive, to Lucy Demery, managing director of fintech investments at Barclays. Ofori, who had worked at Goldman for six years, and handled just over £500 million in client money, said she typically worked with entrepreneurs and first-time founders who built highly profitable businesses and sold them for a lot of money. However, despite breaking the glass ceiling as a Black woman in finance, she wasn't satisfied. "I had gotten to a point in my career where things were going amazingly well," Ofori said. "I was promoted to executive director, and I started to bring in lots of money. I hit that half a billion threshold. That's the threshold they tell you to aim for. I passed that." Ofori recalled sitting in a meeting with one of her bosses and reflecting on what the next six to 10 years looked like for her. "I realized it's just more of the same ... I'd lost my sense of purpose every day. It was almost getting monotonous," she said. "It really shouldn't have taken six years to hit me, but I remember one day I woke up and I was just like 'I make incredibly rich men richer, that's what I do, day in, day out,'" she added. Ofori said she began questioning the dearth of women in investing. "I found that across the board, women, overwhelmingly, were not investing anywhere near the levels men were." Despite women living on average longer than men, "we have less money that isn't being put to work in the way that it should," she said. Britain's gender investment gap currently stands at £567 billion — an increase of £54 billion between January 2023 and January 2024 — according to data from British financial research company Boring Money which surveyed over 6,000 adults in the U.K. It found that men have £1.01 trillion invested compared with £450 billion for women. Additionally, the latest data from Prospect, a British union representing 157,000 professionals across industries like tech, education, transport and legal, found that the gender pensions gap stood at 37.9% between 2021 and 2022 — more than double the gender pay gap, which was reported as 14.9% in 2022. The gender pensions gap refers to the differences in retirement income or retirement wealth between men and women. Ofori said she was stunned by the statistics she found, and this led her on a path to quitting her well-paid executive role at Goldman in 2018, and embarking on a mission to empower women financially. Ofori said that the women she spoke to were more inclined towards saving, and mistakenly believed that placing their money in a cash Individual Savings Account (ISA) was a form of investing. An ISA is a high-interest, tax free, individual savings account in the U.K. which has an annual allowance of £20,000. "Saving and investing are not the same thing, and the two words are used interchangeably often. That annoys me, because they're not the same, and women naturally default to saving and they save thinking they're investing," Ofori said. She added: "With all the best will in the world, you may think you've invested because you've put your money in a cash ISA, but you are not going to hit your goal." Research shows that women are more hesitant about investing. Almost half of women globally feel that investing in the stock market via an individual security or a fund is too risky, a 2022 BNY Mellon Investment Management report that surveyed 8,000 men and women across 16 countries found. And only 28% of women felt confident about investing their money. There are two key reasons that women are locked out of the investing bubble, according to Ofori: a lack of time and confidence. "The first thing is a lot of women tell us they don't know where to start. There's too much information. It's too overwhelming and they don't have time to sit there and figure it out," she said. "So rather than make a mistake, they just don't do anything." Before she left Goldman, Ofori started throwing events for women in London in order to share her story of building wealth for herself and clients — and, within a few months, 2,000 women were signing up to attend. "I realized that I was onto something," she said. "Just because women haven't been investing doesn't mean they don't want to invest. They clearly do." Ofori noticed that attendees to her events were put off by regular investing platforms and didn't know where to start. "The way that the platforms portrayed information and the way that the investments were structured didn't relate with how women think about investing and building their wealth," Ofori said. That's when she decided that she was going to build an FCA regulated multi-asset class investment platform for women. "I know that now my purpose is to help women build wealth," Ofori said. Women who spoke with Ofori about their investing journey often complained about regular investing platforms typically being male-centric. Factors that are off-putting for women include the language used, a lack of transparency about the different levels of investment risks and the funds not relating to their personal goals. "Most, if not all of those platforms were run by men, and their teams were overwhelmingly men so when you're thinking about the teams who are designing products, there are going to be natural inherent things in them that they're building them with men in mind ... the data speaks for itself, if you look at the customers of these companies, they're majority men," Ofori said. In contrast, Propelle is rolling out features in the coming weeks such as a risk assessment tool which explains the different types of risks involved, as well as measuring users' personal risk tolerances. Its smart goal setting feature will allow users to invest in funds with different risk levels based on whether those goals are long-term or short-term. Propelle also has investing options that are based on users' personal values from sustainability to Shariah-compliant funds. It eventually plans to add alternative investments such as fractionalized real estate, startup investing and wine and art investing. "I didn't want to build a platform where women were just investing in things just because it's there and it's not working for them. We really made an effort to make sure that it's suitable for the woman based on whatever background that she has," Ofori said. "Just because, you might have a smaller amount of money, why should you be excluded to asset classes that the rich have been investing in for years, making tons of money? It's obvious why the rich keep getting richer." Get Make It newsletters delivered to your inbox Learn more about the world of CNBC Make It © 2024 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved.

By: Temidayo Omoniyi | Updated: 2024-09-25 | Comments | Related: > Cloud Strategy With the ever-growing demand for data to power Large Language models (LLM), the need for streaming data is on the rise. The influx of data coming in real-time needs to be stored and made useful for prediction or descriptive use cases. Microsoft Azure has tools to achieve this use case with its many resources for data professionals. We can achieve predictive and descriptive models by introducing resources like Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Machine Learning, and Power BI services. To better understand this article, it is advised to read the previous article titled "Data Streaming Micro-Service Architecture with Azure Technology". This article is a continuation, with a few resources being provisioned. Project Architecture Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics is a cloud-based service designed to process and analyze large volumes of data from a variety of sources, including applications, social media feeds, and sensors, in real-time. The following steps should be taken to provide an Azures Stream Analytics job. Step 1: Basic Settings. In your Azure portal, fill in the following information, as seen in the image below. Step 2: Storage Account (Optional). This is optional. You can add a storage account to Azure Stream Analytics by setting up your container in Azure Data Lake. This is also used to sort the ingested data in real-time in the Azure storage account. Leave all other settings at default and click Review + create to provision the Azure Stream Analytics Job. Now that we have successfully provisioned the Azure Stream Analytics Job, we need to read and analyze the data. Set Input. This refers to the source at which the data will be ingested in Azure Stream Analytics. This is obtained from Azure Event Hub. From Azure Stream Analytics, expand Job topology, then select Inputs. This should open a new window, where you click Add input and select Event Hub. In the new window, fill in the following from the image below and click Save. Note: Leave the rest at default. Test Input Connection. After successfully creating the Azure Event Hub input, test the connection by clicking the test connection icon (not shown). If all is done appropriately, you should receive a Successful connection test message. Set Output. From the Project Architecture, we plan to move aggregated data from Azure Stream Analytics to the Power BI Streaming Dataset. The next steps should be followed to achieve the output dataset: Step 1: Create Power BI Workspace. A workspace is a collaborative area containing datasets (semantic models), reports, dashboards, etc., where colleagues develop and share business intelligence reports. You can learn more about the Power BI Service workspace by reading one of our previous articles. In your Power BI Service, click on Workspaces and select New | Workspace. This should open a new window where you need to fill in the following information and click Apply. Step 2: Assign Stream Analytic Output to Power BI Workspace. Now that you have created the Power BI workspace, head back to your Azure Stream Analytics in your Stream Analytics. In your Stream Analytics, select Outputs, Add Output, and choose Power BI. In the new window, fill in the following information from the image below. Click Save. Step 3: Query Stream Data. In your Stream Analytics, click on Query. This will open a new window where you are expected to fill in the following. From the query below, you will notice the data is being read from Stream Analytics and pushed into the Power BI workspace streamyahoofinance we created earlier. If you are satisfied with the query, start the Stream Analytics job by clicking the Start job button. This automatically starts Steam Analytics and pushes the data to the Power BI Service dataset. Now that your Stream Analytics job is running, head to the Power BI Service workspace created to confirm the dataset. If you notice the dataset is not appearing, try refreshing the web browser and run again. In your Semantic model, click the 3 dots and select Create report. This will open Power BI Design Canvas. In Power BI Report Canvas, you can create simple reports of your choice. The report below might have a limited amount of insight because it was done on a weekend when most stock markets are closed for the week. Azure Machine Learning Studio is a web-based development environment for data professionals for building, testing, and deploying machine learning models on the Microsoft Azure Platform. The following steps should be taken to create Azure Machine Learning. Step 1: Basic Configuration. In your Azure Portal, search for Azure ML Studio and fill in the necessary settings. Click Review + create. Step 2: Launch Studio. After successfully provisioning Azure ML Studio, click Launch studio to start building your models. Step 3: Create Compute. Azure ML Compute refers to the computing resources you use to run your machine learning projects in Azure Machine Learning. These resources provide the processing power and memory needed to train your models, analyze data, and deploy them into production. There are different types of computing available in Azure Machine Learning. For this article, we will focus on the Compute Instance and Compute Cluster, their differences, and when best to use them. Create the Compute Instance: You can manually stop the cluster if you are not using it or set it to off after a certain inactive period. During real-world scenarios, it is best to develop your model in a test environment and then import it to Azure Machine Learning. This is for cost-saving purposes and other use cases. We will use the Jupyter Notebook to test and deploy the base to Azure ML for production use cases. The following steps will help to create a forecast model from Yahoo Finance: Step 1: Install All Necessary Libraries. Before starting the process, we need to install all necessary libraries for this project. Open your Windows terminal and paste the script below to install all the required Python Wheels. Step 2: Import All Needed Libraries. Here is a list of imported libraries needed for this project. Step 3: Get Historical Data. Note:Since we want to create a forecast model, we need historical data to train the model for prediction purposes. Data ingested from Yahoo Finance API with the Azure Function Timer trigger are in real-time; this means we don't have enough historical data to create a predictive model. Create a function that will help get the Nvidia stock data from the start date of 2010-01-01 till current date. This date range would provide enough historical data to train the model. Step 4: Visualization. Using the matplotlib library, we will create a line chart to provide a trend to understand the closing price of NVDA stock over the past couple of years. Step 5: Filter Closing Price Column. We need to create a new DataFrame with only the Close column. We plan to create a forecast model based on the Closing price column. Step 6: Standardize the Data. Scaling the data using the MinMaxScaler function is a method to slice the data to fit within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. The MinMaxScaler is part of the sklearn.preprocessing module. Step 7: Split Data to Train. Splitting the data will help prepare the training data for the machine learning model, specifically for our case, which is a time series prediction. Step 8: Convert x_train and y_train to Numpy Array. We need to convert the training data list into a numpy array and reshape the input data into the needed format for the forecast machine learning model, which is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Step 9: Create Model. Using the LSTM model for time prediction, the following lines of code are used in creating the needed model: The following specifies the number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset using the epoch number. Step 10: Split Data to Test. The code snippet below is used to split the data into both the x_test and y_test needed for the forecast model. Step 11: Create a Forecast Chart. With all the necessary information, we can create a forecast chart using the historical data. Looking at the image below, you will notice that the Predicted Trend and Validation trend are close to the train forecast. We can further improve the model's accuracy by performing hyper-parameter and model tuning. Now that we are satisfied with the model, we can import it to Azure Machine Learning. In your Azure Machine Learning Notebook tab, click the 3 dots (not shown), and then select Upload files. This will open another window. In the new window, click the + icon to upload the .ipynb file from your local machine, check all the boxes, and click Upload. With the file successfully uploaded, we can save the notebook, install all necessary libraries, and run the model. In this article, we have covered both descriptive and predictive models based on streaming data. We created a Power BI service workspace to ingest financial data from Yahoo Finance into the Power BI Stream Dataset Semantic model. The same process was repeated for the predictive model, where we created a model to forecast price prediction based on historical data. For the Forecast model, we could not use it in real-time as we needed historical data to first train the model before creating predictions. Subsequent articles on this project will be released to make further improvements to the predictive model.

This should open a new window, where you click Add input and select Event Hub. In the new window, fill in the following from the image below and click Save. Note: Leave the rest at default. Test Input Connection. After successfully creating the Azure Event Hub input, test the connection by clicking the test connection icon (not shown). If all is done appropriately, you should receive a Successful connection test message. Set Output. From the Project Architecture, we plan to move aggregated data from Azure Stream Analytics to the Power BI Streaming Dataset. The next steps should be followed to achieve the output dataset: Step 1: Create Power BI Workspace. A workspace is a collaborative area containing datasets (semantic models), reports, dashboards, etc., where colleagues develop and share business intelligence reports. You can learn more about the Power BI Service workspace by reading one of our previous articles. In your Power BI Service, click on Workspaces and select New | Workspace. This should open a new window where you need to fill in the following information and click Apply. Step 2: Assign Stream Analytic Output to Power BI Workspace. Now that you have created the Power BI workspace, head back to your Azure Stream Analytics in your Stream Analytics. In your Stream Analytics, select Outputs, Add Output, and choose Power BI. In the new window, fill in the following information from the image below. Click Save. Step 3: Query Stream Data. In your Stream Analytics, click on Query. This will open a new window where you are expected to fill in the following. From the query below, you will notice the data is being read from Stream Analytics and pushed into the Power BI workspace streamyahoofinance we created earlier. If you are satisfied with the query, start the Stream Analytics job by clicking the Start job button. This automatically starts Steam Analytics and pushes the data to the Power BI Service dataset. Now that your Stream Analytics job is running, head to the Power BI Service workspace created to confirm the dataset. If you notice the dataset is not appearing, try refreshing the web browser and run again. In your Semantic model, click the 3 dots and select Create report. This will open Power BI Design Canvas. In Power BI Report Canvas, you can create simple reports of your choice. The report below might have a limited amount of insight because it was done on a weekend when most stock markets are closed for the week. Azure Machine Learning Studio is a web-based development environment for data professionals for building, testing, and deploying machine learning models on the Microsoft Azure Platform. The following steps should be taken to create Azure Machine Learning. Step 1: Basic Configuration. In your Azure Portal, search for Azure ML Studio and fill in the necessary settings. Click Review + create. Step 2: Launch Studio. After successfully provisioning Azure ML Studio, click Launch studio to start building your models. Step 3: Create Compute. Azure ML Compute refers to the computing resources you use to run your machine learning projects in Azure Machine Learning. These resources provide the processing power and memory needed to train your models, analyze data, and deploy them into production. There are different types of computing available in Azure Machine Learning. For this article, we will focus on the Compute Instance and Compute Cluster, their differences, and when best to use them. Create the Compute Instance: You can manually stop the cluster if you are not using it or set it to off after a certain inactive period. During real-world scenarios, it is best to develop your model in a test environment and then import it to Azure Machine Learning. This is for cost-saving purposes and other use cases. We will use the Jupyter Notebook to test and deploy the base to Azure ML for production use cases. The following steps will help to create a forecast model from Yahoo Finance: Step 1: Install All Necessary Libraries. Before starting the process, we need to install all necessary libraries for this project. Open your Windows terminal and paste the script below to install all the required Python Wheels. Step 2: Import All Needed Libraries. Here is a list of imported libraries needed for this project. Step 3: Get Historical Data. Note:Since we want to create a forecast model, we need historical data to train the model for prediction purposes. Data ingested from Yahoo Finance API with the Azure Function Timer trigger are in real-time; this means we don't have enough historical data to create a predictive model. Create a function that will help get the Nvidia stock data from the start date of 2010-01-01 till current date. This date range would provide enough historical data to train the model. Step 4: Visualization. Using the matplotlib library, we will create a line chart to provide a trend to understand the closing price of NVDA stock over the past couple of years. Step 5: Filter Closing Price Column. We need to create a new DataFrame with only the Close column. We plan to create a forecast model based on the Closing price column. Step 6: Standardize the Data. Scaling the data using the MinMaxScaler function is a method to slice the data to fit within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. The MinMaxScaler is part of the sklearn.preprocessing module. Step 7: Split Data to Train. Splitting the data will help prepare the training data for the machine learning model, specifically for our case, which is a time series prediction. Step 8: Convert x_train and y_train to Numpy Array. We need to convert the training data list into a numpy array and reshape the input data into the needed format for the forecast machine learning model, which is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Step 9: Create Model. Using the LSTM model for time prediction, the following lines of code are used in creating the needed model: The following specifies the number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset using the epoch number. Step 10: Split Data to Test. The code snippet below is used to split the data into both the x_test and y_test needed for the forecast model. Step 11: Create a Forecast Chart. With all the necessary information, we can create a forecast chart using the historical data. Looking at the image below, you will notice that the Predicted Trend and Validation trend are close to the train forecast. We can further improve the model's accuracy by performing hyper-parameter and model tuning. Now that we are satisfied with the model, we can import it to Azure Machine Learning. In your Azure Machine Learning Notebook tab, click the 3 dots (not shown), and then select Upload files. This will open another window. In the new window, click the + icon to upload the .ipynb file from your local machine, check all the boxes, and click Upload. With the file successfully uploaded, we can save the notebook, install all necessary libraries, and run the model. In this article, we have covered both descriptive and predictive models based on streaming data. We created a Power BI service workspace to ingest financial data from Yahoo Finance into the Power BI Stream Dataset Semantic model. The same process was repeated for the predictive model, where we created a model to forecast price prediction based on historical data. For the Forecast model, we could not use it in real-time as we needed historical data to first train the model before creating predictions. Subsequent articles on this project will be released to make further improvements to the predictive model.

Last chance: Secure your pass for the Digiday Media Buying Summit | Oct. 15-17 Last chance: Secure your pass for the Digiday Media Buying Summit | Oct. 15-17 This Future of TV Briefing covers the latest in streaming and TV for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Wednesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → This week’s Future of TV Briefing looks at how Overtime and Vox Media are adapting their podcasts into long-form videos. Honestly, I thought video podcasts were just a fad. And obviously, I was wrong. Way wrong. More than 170 million people have watched a video podcast on Spotify, per the company, and YouTube has become the “most used” platform for consuming podcasts, according to a study by Cumulus Media and Signal Hill Insights. All of which is to say: Podcasts are becoming largely video productions. As a result, podcast publishers are having to sort out how to adapt podcasts into videos. Sure, they can just hook up a show’s RSS feed to YouTube and have the audio play over a static image of the podcast’s thumbnail image. But then that’s not really a video podcast. “There is a version of a video show that you could do, say, on YouTube that is a static image and just a long-form audio bed underneath it. That doesn’t feel as native to the platform, even though people do consume that way. And so as we think about podcasts as like a modern talk show – our chat podcasts at least – we are thinking about what’s native to the different platforms where they appear,” said Nishat Kurwa, svp and executive producer for podcasts at Vox Media, which has been producing video podcasts since The Verge’s Vergecast debuted in November 2011. Making video podcasts native to platforms like YouTube means making sure a video podcast is as much a video as a podcast. There are some basic elements, like filming the hosts and guests. But simply recording a Zoom session or setting up a single camera in a podcast studio doesn’t necessarily suffice. “It’s important for us to be cutting and changing the layout of the screen, just to keep the user engaged. That’s one thing that you never need to think about for audio, vs. on video, it’s like, ‘How is there some type of change every once in a while so that people are not just looking at the same type of image for too long?’” said Sam Gordon, editor-in-chief of Overtime, which started producing long-form video podcasts roughly six months ago and has accumulated 55 million views on YouTube for those podcasts in the past two months. Much of the answer to that question depends on how the podcast is recorded. If done entirely in person, then a best practice is to set up three cameras on set: one focused on the host, one focused on the guest(s) or cohost and one set at a wide angle to show all parties. “That way we always have two angles that we can pull from for any given person,” said Gordon. In-person recordings also open up production design opportunities to create visual interest on the set. For example, Sue Bird’s and Megan Rapinoe’s podcast with Vox Media, “A Touch More,” originated as an Instagram Live series recorded at home. So the video podcast is filmed in one of Vox Media’s studios on a set “that looks like a cozy room,” said Kurwa. If recorded remotely via Zoom or another video conferencing platform, creating visual interest can be trickier. Webcam-quality clips are often of lower resolution than what people are accustomed to watching on YouTube, especially as more of YouTube’s watch time takes place on TV screens. This is where graphics become the unsung workhorse of the video podcast. “You can add a lot of personality with graphics,” said Kurwa. Overtime, for example, has graphics packages for each of its shows recorded via Zoom. These graphics enable the Zoom recordings to be inset as opposed to scaled up to cover the entire screen and enlarge the lower image quality. Additionally, Overtime sometimes adds motion to the graphics that add depth and life to the shot. “We also have graphics where we can show multiple camera angles at once. If you go full screen, and it’s half one [clip] and half the other, it’s not visually engaging,” Gordon said. Vox Media similarly enlists its design team to create custom visuals and motion graphics for its video podcasts. “We map out what the segments are going to be in the show. We talk to the design team about some recurring templates that we think we’re going to use, whether that’s the segment title cards or recurring motion graphics that we think will be useful to have over time,” Kurwa said. Minding the visual as well as aural quality of podcasts is also reshaping the skillsets of those working on podcasts. Case in point: Production assistants on the Vox Media Podcast Network’s production team have historically been responsible for pulling archival audio clips and now are being asked to also pull b-roll video clips. “We are seeing the future of podcasts as multi-platform shows. I think that is a skillset that’s really beneficial for podcast producers to have, so that they can be more versatile in the jobs of now, the jobs of the future, and be more of an asset to more kinds of productions,” Kurwa said. “It’s: Speak out, but don’t speak out if you want to pay your rent, but speak out if you want to be a morally accepted creator, but don’t speak out if you want to be able to pay your bills.” Thanks to the Summer Olympics airing across traditional TV and streaming, people spent more time watching NBCUniversal properties on their TV screens in August than any other media company’s, according to Nielsen’s latest Media Distributor Gauge viewership report. NBCUniversal’s upswing didn’t necessarily come at a cost to all other companies’ watch time shares. YouTube and Roku’s The Roku Channel gained share in the month. 90%: Percentage share of Paramount Global’s planned layoffs that the company expects to have been completed after Tuesday. $100: Price of Roku’s new Ultra connected TV device.

Lionsgate’s AI deal: The movie and TV studio has signed a deal with generative AI company Runway that gives the latter access to its content library and the former access to an AI model trained on that content, seemingly without any money changing hands between the two, according to The Wall Street Journal. YouTube’s AI tools: A year after unveiling generative AI tools for creators, YouTube is adding to its lineup by formally rolling out products to let creators have generative AI come up with video concepts and even create actual videos (albeit only up to 6-second-long clips), according to The Verge.

Title: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM)’s Geopolitical Risks Could Weigh on Shares
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-limited-033440682.html

We recently published a list of 10 Best Foreign Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other best foreign stocks to buy now. The close of 2024 is resulting in a much needed paradigm shift for US and global equities. Ever since the coronavirus pandemic disrupted our way of living in 2020, investors have had to deal with one setback or another. While the immediate effect of the pandemic equities saw technology stocks soar, other sectors, such as energy and travel didn’t. Then, inflation rose in 2022 forcing central banks worldwide to rapidly hike interest rates, which naturally made equities much less attractive than before. Since then, rates have been high in Europe and the US as well as in the developing world. However, with the European Central Bank’s (ECB) and Bank of England’s (BOE) latest rate cut decision, things appear to be changing. The ECB got the ball rolling in June after it cut interest rates by 25 basis points and then followed up with another 25 point cut in September. These decisions have been influenced to some extent by economic growth concerns. During the press conference after she announced the rate cuts, ECB President Christine Lagarde commented that while her organization had initially expected European economic growth to pick up, this hadn’t been the case. As per Lagarde, “We have revised downwards the outlook for growth, because the consumption that we had anticipated for now, essentially, because net income has begun to increase, inflation has gone down significantly and we were expecting consumption to pick up, has not picked up. And I think that we will be looking at that carefully when we produce our next growth and GDP numbers.” During Q2 2024, the EU and broader Euro area’s GDP grew sequentially by 0.3%, which was similar to the Q1 figures. On an annual basis, the EU’s GDP marked a 0.8% growth while the Euro area’s growth was 0.6%. Lagarde’s comments were accompanied by the ECB’s updated growth estimates for 2024, 2025, and 2026. While it had expected these to sit at 0.9%, 1.4%, and 1.6%, respectively, the updated estimates reduced all of these by 0.1 percentage point. With the EU’s economic performance, one country’s under performance is relevant for the broader area as well as an analysis of foreign or exUSA economies. This country is Europe’s largest economy, Germany. The German economy was 2023’s worst performer among major economies as it contracted by 0.3%. In Q2, the GDP contracted by 0.1% sequentially and missed analyst estimates of 0.1%. This slowdown came at a time when inflation jumped by 2.6% in July and accelerated by 0.1 percentage point over June. The economic uncertainty has also affected German investors, as data from the ZEW economic research institute’s economic sentiment index shows that the index fell to a whopping 3.6 points from an earlier 19.2 points. Analysts had expected it to sit at 17 points. Additionally, investor perceptions of the economy fell to levels last seen just as the coronavirus had started to wreak havoc in May 2020 and sat at -84.5. Germany is struggling because the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has cut its supply of cheap Russian gas. While this has increased costs, on the demand side, Germany is suffering from a weak Chinese economy. Data from the Federal Statistical Office shows that Germany’s exports to China in May sat at €7.5 billion for a 14% annual drop. Between January to May, the exports were €40.3 billion, for a 10%+ drop over 2022. With German firms such as LVMH experiencing a 14% Chinese sales drop in Q2 and Swatch witnessing a 30% drop in H1, it’s clear that Chinese consumers are in no mood for discretionary spending. This has also led to Goldman recommending that investors sell European stocks with Chinese exposure as it is worried about its basket of European stocks. As per the bank, while “a great deal of earnings downgrades have already occurred year-to-date for our luxury basket, we worry that more could take place.” It adds that “Also, the valuation premium of the basket has deflated, but remains on the high side of its history.” Pessimism about China is evident in the data as well. During Q2, the economy grew by 4.7%, with retail sales whimpering through a 2% growth rate. This was the slowest since December 2022, when the Zero COVID lock downs were still making their impact across the country. In the aftermath of the disappointing data from the world’s second largest economy, Goldman and Citi, which had earlier expected the Chinese economy to grow by 4.9% and 4.8%, slashed their estimates to 4.7%. Goldman commented “We believe the risk that China will miss the ‘around 5%’ full-year GDP growth target is on the rise, and thus the urgency for more demand-side easing measures is also increasing,” while Citi stated, “We believe fiscal policy needs to step up to so as to break the austerity trap and timely deploy growth support.” Yet, while Germany and China have struggled, the world’s largest economy America has thrived. US GDP grew by 3.1% annually in Q2, lending credence to the argument of American exceptionalism. On a quarterly basis, it was up by 0.7%, despite the fact that interest rates remain at a 24 year high. This growth has created ample room for the Federal Reserve to keep rates high, and now, most expect that an interest rate cut is incoming. Due to America’s dominant role in global economic affairs, the Fed’s decisions have a global impact. For European stocks, it meant that the day before the rate cut decision, the index tracking Europe’s top 600 stocks gained 0.5% while the British stock market jumped by 0.7%. Our Methodology To make our list of the best foreign stocks to buy, we ranked the 40 most valuable exUS stocks in terms of market capitalization by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q2 2024. Out of these, the top stocks were chosen. Care was taken to ensure that stocks that were founded in America but are headquartered in Ireland or other jurisdictions were eliminated. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 156 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer which provides it with a wide moat in the industry. Some of its biggest and most lucrative customers include tech companies like Apple, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and AMD. Since chip designing is a complex process that takes years of development, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) benefits from long term customer partnerships. It also leads its primary rival Samsung when it comes to product quality which ensures that all of the world’s biggest companies continue to rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) to manufacture their chips. The firm is also currently competing with beleaguered US chip giant Intel, which plans to produce its 18A process in 2025. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) might see competition from Intel some years down the road if the latter can ramp up its products, and the only worries surrounding the firm is its operations base in Taiwan which is vulnerable to conflict with China. ClearBridge Investments mentioned Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said: “However, we added to our semiconductor positioning during the quarter with the purchase of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). TSM, an out-of-benchmark name, is the world’s fabrication production provider of choice. The criticality and sophistication of the company’s manufacturing footprint powers all of the leading edge fabless global semiconductor companies, including Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD and Broadcom. While AI has driven upside in data centers, PCs and handsets are at cycle lows, positioning half of the company’s business for a recovery.” Overall TSM ranks 1st on our list of best foreign stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

CrowdStrike’s senior vice-president for counter adversary operations, Adam Meyers, reiterated his company’s apology today during a House subcommittee hearing and went on to say that the company has launched a configuration update for its Falcon Sensor software system. Meyers was grilled Tuesday afternoon by lawmakers from the House’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection subcommittee over the company’s failure to properly address its faulty software update that led to a global IT outage in mid-July. Following the global outage, companies across the airlines, banking, telecommunications, and healthcare industries were deeply affected for weeks. The outage disrupted internet services, affecting about 8.5 million Microsoft (MSFT) Windows devices, per Reuters. “We are deeply sorry this happened, and we are determined to prevent this from happening again,” Meyers said at the hearing. “We have undertaken a full review of our systems and begun implementing plans to bolster our content update procedures so that we emerge from this experience as a stronger company.” During the grilling session, which was led by Republican Rep. Mark Green from Tennessee, Meyers said CrowdStrike (CRWD) takes “full responsibility” for the international system crashes. He also deemed that the issues were not the result of a cyberattack, nor was it induced by artificial intelligence. “The July 19 incident stemmed from a confluence of factors that ultimately resulted in the Falcon sensor attempting to follow a threat detection configuration for which there was no corresponding definition of what to do,” Meyers said. After the IT incident, CrowdStrike lost about $60 million in contract sales. The cybersecurity firm said that the incident scared off customers who were looking to close deals during the final weeks of the second quarter. Meyers announced during the hearing that the company had taken several steps to sharpen its system and would prevent another outage from happening at this level again. He stated that CrowdStrike will no longer unveil its software updates internationally to all customers in a single session. The company will also allow customers to select when they receive their updates. They have the option of waiting to be the second or third group of clients who will receive the update after it goes public. “Mistakes can happen,” Green said. “However, we cannot allow a mistake of this magnitude to happen again. A global IT outage that impacts every sector of the economy is a catastrophe that we would expect to see in a movie. It is something that we would expect to be carefully executed by a malicious and sophisticated nation-state actor.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) director John L. Hennessy has sold shares of the company's Class A common stock, according to a recent SEC filing. The transaction, dated September 23, involved the sale of 700 shares at a price of $165 each, totaling $115,500. Following the sale, Hennessy's direct and indirect holdings include 27,824 shares of Class A common stock and 6,416 shares of Class C capital stock, some of which are held by trusts. The transaction was executed under a pre-arranged trading plan known as Rule 10b5-1, which allows company insiders to sell shares over a predetermined period of time. This plan was adopted by the John L. Hennessy and Andrea J. Hennessy Revocable Trust on November 1, 2023. Hennessy's remaining Class C capital stock holdings reflect both direct and indirect ownership through trusts. His indirect holdings in Class C capital stock amount to 6,093 shares, while direct holdings are at 323 shares. Additionally, Hennessy has interests in several tranches of Class C Google Stock Units (GSUs), which are set to vest over time subject to continued service on Alphabet's Board. Investors often monitor insider transactions for insights into executive confidence in the company's prospects. Sales and purchases of company stock by insiders can be routine, but they are disclosed to the public to ensure transparency. Hennessy's recent transaction is part of regular financial planning and does not necessarily indicate a change in the company's outlook or management's view of its potential. In other recent news, Alphabet Inc.'s Google has been making significant strides in various sectors. In a collaborative effort with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Google is addressing competition concerns related to the management of third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. This partnership aims to develop a solution that addresses the CMA's competition concerns while considering the broader implications for user privacy and online services that rely on advertising revenue. In an innovative move, Google has teamed up with Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) to introduce an artificial intelligence assistant within a smartphone app for drivers. This assistant utilizes Google's Gemini large language models and cloud computing resources. The AI assistant is currently available to approximately 120,000 owners of Volkswagen’s Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) and Atlas Cross Sport models, with plans to expand its availability to other vehicles in the near future. Google has also engaged with the European Union to influence the upcoming enforcement of the AI Act, aiming to shape the rigor of this legislation that could impose significant fines for non-compliance. Google, along with other tech giants, has applied to join the working groups for the AI Act, seeking to contribute their perspective to the regulations. In a significant move into the carbon offset market, Google purchased 50,000 metric tons of nature-based carbon removal credits from a Brazilian startup named Mombak. This marks Google's first foray into carbon projects within Brazil and represents a commitment to achieve these credits by the year 2030. All these recent developments highlight Google's proactive approach towards addressing competition concerns, integrating advanced AI capabilities into consumer applications, influencing global AI regulations, and making significant commitments to environmental sustainability. As Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to make headlines with insider stock transactions, investors are keen to understand the company's financial standing. According to InvestingPro data, Alphabet boasts a robust market capitalization of approximately $2 trillion USD. This places the tech giant among the most valuable companies globally, reflecting its significant impact on the industry. Analyzing Alphabet's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is currently at 23.29, can provide investors with a clearer picture of the company's valuation. This metric is particularly interesting when considering the company's near-term earnings growth, as Alphabet is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to this growth. This suggests that the company's stock might be undervalued based on its earnings potential, an InvestingPro Tip that could indicate a favorable buying opportunity for investors. Furthermore, Alphabet's revenue growth over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 stands at 13.38%, demonstrating the company's ability to increase its earnings over time. This sustained growth is a testament to Alphabet's strong position in the Interactive Media & Services industry, another InvestingPro Tip that underscores the company's prominence in its sector. For those interested in exploring more about Alphabet's financial health and future prospects, additional InvestingPro Tips are available. In fact, there are 11 more tips listed on InvestingPro that could provide valuable insights for investors contemplating their next move with Alphabet's stock.

Title: Here's How Much Nvidia Stock CEO Jensen Huang Has Sold Lately

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang concluded a planned sale of more than $700 million worth of company stock, regulatory filings Tuesday showed. Huang had previously announced his intention to sell as many as 6 million shares of Nvidia by the first quarter of 2025 under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC's) 10b5-1 rule, which allows insiders to set up a trading plan for selling stocks. He reached that limit months ahead of the plan's expiration, with the sale of 120,000 shares worth nearly $14.3 million, according to an SEC filing. The CEO still holds 75.4 million Nvidia shares directly and another 786 million through various trusts and a partnership, according to another filing. Shares of Nvidia closed nearly 4% higher at $120.87 Tuesday. They've more than doubled in value since the start of the year amid booming demand for the company's chips to support artificial intelligence (AI).

Title: Nvidia stock's 20% drop is actually a good sign for the market, strategist says. Here's why

Tony Roth, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors (MTB), spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, below. ANDY MILLS (AM): Big tech names such as Nvidia and Microsoft have led the market higher over the last couple of years. Do you see that continuing in 2025? TONY ROTH (TR): Right now, we see a rotation trade into other areas of the market, but I think, longer term, we certainly expect to see those big names continue to grow earnings at a pretty rapid pace. One thing that’s important to keep in mind, though, is that it’s not a monolithic group. So there are some companies that are gonna do a lot better than others. Even within the Magnificent Seven, you’re probably going to see a rotation of some names out of that group and some names into that group. One of the aspects of what’s happening in the market today that I think is really quite notable is that we’re at new, all-time highs as we sit here. And Nvidia (NVDA) is probably about 20% off of its all-time high. Given what we experienced in the first half of the year — where it seemed to be a market driven by a single stock — to be able to say that at this point is pretty remarkable. I think most participants might have felt that it would be hard to get to these levels on the S&P without leadership from Nvidia. And not only have we not had leadership, but it’s actually been going in another direction. AM: Yeah. So AI is, I think, for most investors, a pretty obvious place where people have been investing. What other sectors are you guys looking at that people should try to get into this year? TR: Financials have worked pretty well this year — not all equally, again, but if you look, for example, at the big money center banks, they’ve done pretty well. Some of them have done extraordinarily well, like JP Morgan, which is priced at pretty lofty levels now. But overall, right now with rates coming down, if we don’t have a recession, which is our base-case view, that should certainly favor regional banks. And we think that, for example, also in the financial sector, we like insurance companies, which continue to benefit from these expanded premiums. And I think a lot of the costs are probably going to abate, but the premiums won’t come down as fast. So [insurance companies will] take advantage of that leverage. It’s almost like when oil prices come down but you don’t see the price at the pump come down quite as fast. So I think you’ll see that phenomenon with insurance companies. And then other areas that we like are discretionary companies within this economy, because we do think the consumer, particularly the higher-end consumer, is in good shape. And beyond that, we’re really focused across all sectors on quality companies — so companies that have attractive debt-to-equity ratios that are not too levered, that have low variability of earnings, that have good management teams, intellectual property, intellectual capital, et cetera. Those kinds of companies should do well in this type of environment. AM: Now, you mentioned that your firm doesn’t see a recession as a likely scenario going forward. What makes you guys believe that? TR: I would probably start with the labor market. The labor market is really the foundation for the consumer. So when you look at the labor market, what you see is that jobless claims are at an all-time low actually relative to the overall size of the labor market. And when you look at wages, real wages are not only positive, which we haven’t seen for a long time, but if you look at what we think of as (to get a little wonky) the second derivative, which is where a real wage is going, they’re actually increasing. They’re gaining ground. So when you look at that and you consider that the top three quartiles of the consumer still have excess savings and checking accounts, et cetera, that bodes really well for the economy. So the labor market is in pretty good shape. It’s not in great shape. It’s not in perfect shape. There are some concerning signals, as well, but that’s part of the normalization process. So the labor market’s in good shape, the consumer’s in good shape, CapEx continues to do well. And typically when you see a recession, there’s usually a catalyst. There’s usually excess investment, or there’s a bubble, a financial bubble, or there may even be an external, if you will, geopolitical or exogenous event. And so we don’t see any of those happening, necessarily. Sure, that could happen as a result of the election outcome, but there are so many levels of uncertainty with the election right now that we’re not investing for that. We’ll keep a very close eye on that, but right now we’re not tying the election to a recession. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

NerdWallet, Inc. does not offer advisory or brokerage services, nor does it recommend or advise investors to buy or sell particular stocks, securities or other investments. In the early hours of July 19, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (CRWD) published a faulty software update that temporarily disabled more than 8.5 million PCs that use its services. The outage caused chaos across banking, airlines, health care and several other industries, and it sent CrowdStrike shares plummeting more than 20% over the following two trading days. It also drew attention to the importance of reliable cybersecurity companies — and to the potential volatility of cybersecurity stocks. Cybersecurity stocks are shares of publicly-traded companies that protect computer systems from digital threats. Some, such as CrowdStrike, Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks, are completely focused on cybersecurity, while others, such as Datadog, Cisco, Broadcom and Dell, are diversified technology companies that provide cybersecurity services along with other offerings. According to Roosevelt Bowman, an investment strategist with Bernstein Private Wealth Management, the effect of major technical outages on cybersecurity companies is hard to predict. “It’s not often that you see a single event ‘doom’ a company,” Bowman says. However, he described two ways in which a bad-news event such as an outage can push down a stock’s price in the long term. The first is if the event in question pushes down a company’s expected future earnings to a point where it looks too expensive at its current price. The second way in which a scandal such as a technical outage can hurt the long-term trajectory of a stock, according to Bowman, is if there are “subsequent failures.” CrowdStrike’s software has been linked with minor computer outages before, although it has never experienced an outage on the scale of the July 19 incident. Only time will tell if it can rebuild its reputation from here.

Bowman says that his firm is “following” cybersecurity stocks, in light of the rising volume of consumer data that needs to be protected from threats. He notes that the shift from in-person shopping to online shopping over the last decade has created “opportunity” for the industry. You’ll need a brokerage account to buy cybersecurity stocks — and you’ll also need to choose between buying individual cybersecurity stocks, like the ones shown in the tables above, or cybersecurity exchange-traded funds (ETFs). There are four cybersecurity ETFs with at least $500 million in assets on the market today. They’re listed below in order of one-year performance.

All may not be going well for Bernard Arnault, who owns luxury brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, after a whopping $54 billion wipeout. LVMH’s Arnault was once considered to be the world’s richest man, but has now fallen to 5th place. With an aim to stay in his role longer, the founder of the Paris-based behemoth pushed to raise the retirement age from 75 to 80 in 2022. “I have five members of the family working in the group, he told Bloomberg in an interview this year. “Let’s see if one of them has the capacity to take over.” The 75-year-old boss had an estimated net worth of $231 billion in March, falling to $200 billion by June, before eventually plummeting to $177 billion on Monday. While he still remains wealthier than former Microsoft (MSFT) CEOs Bill Gates ($163 billion) and Steve Ballmer ($150 billion), he now ranks lower than Elon Musk ($265 billion), Jeff Bezos ($216 billion), Mark Zuckerberg ($200 billion) and Larry Ellison ($178 billion), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The drop in Arnault’s rank comes after the company’s stock price dipped 20%, wiping out $54 billion from his net worth. LVMH reported a fall in revenues, with its wine and spirits section being hit the hardest. According to its earnings report, Champagne sales declined 15% in the first half of the year compared to the same period a year ago. But LVMH is not alone. Analysts at Bank of America Securities (BAC) recently downgraded European luxury stocks, citing sectorial slowdown into the second half of 2024 and next year. While LVMH was downgraded from “buy” to “neutral, Germany’s Hugo Boss (BOSSY) was moved from “buy” to “underperform.” The bank analysts warn of falling demand for luxury brands among high-spending Chinese consumers. Across European luxury firms, the Bank of America analysts expect a 1% revenue decline in 2024, addressing challenges across the luxury sector. France remains a key exporter of luxury bags in China. According to a study by consultancy Asterès, LVMH’s fashion exports accounted for 4% of total French exports in 2023. But LVMH may face some headwinds. The ongoing tensions between China and Europe could also put LVMH in a tough spot. The challenge also comes at a time when there have been some leadership shifts in the organization, with all five of Arnault’s children in operational roles and four having board seats.

September 24, 2024 14:29 ET | Source: Portnoy Law Portnoy Law Investors can contact the law firm at no cost to learn more about recovering their losses LOS ANGELES, Sept. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises Ford Motor Company. ("Ford" or the "Company") (NYSE: F) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between October 28, 2021 and July 24, 2024, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Ford investors have until October 7, 2024 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford reported its second-quarter financial results for 2024, indicating that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” Consequently, Ford revised its full-year earnings outlook for its electric vehicle segment to account for “higher warranty costs than originally planned.” Reports from analysts and major news outlets, including The Associated Press and The Washington Post, noted that warranty and recall expenses reached $2.3 billion in the second quarter—$800 million more than in the first quarter and $700 million higher than the same period last year. As a result of this news, Ford’s stock price dropped by $2.51, or 18.36%, closing at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024, with unusually high trading volume. The class action complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, the Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose significant adverse information regarding the Company’s business and prospects. Specifically, it claims that the Defendants did not inform investors that: (1) there were deficiencies in the quality assurance of certain vehicle models; (2) these deficiencies were leading to increased warranty costs; (3) the Company’s warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues of the sold vehicles; (4) as a consequence, the Company’s profitability was likely to be negatively impacted; and (5) due to these issues, the Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business and future lacked a reasonable basis and were materially misleading.

Title: Novo Nordisk's CEO took the Washington hot seat over Ozempic prices. 3 takeaways from his testimony
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-novo-nordisk-wegovy-ceo-senate-testimony-1851656166
Time Published: 2024-09-24T17:50:00Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO) CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen agreed today, during a Senate committee hearing, to sit down with lawmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to look into the possibility of cutting list prices for the company’s popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs. Jørgensen was grilled Tuesday morning by the the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders, regarding what the company charges for its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy in the U.S. compared with other countries. Ozempic and Wegovy belong to a class of weight-loss and diabetes drugs known as GLP-1 medications. Recent trials have found these drugs have additional health benefits such as cutting heart risks and alleviating symptoms of sleep apnea. Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate the global market for this drug class will reach $105 billion by 2030. Soaring demand for these treatments have turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, due to high prices, insurers have been hesitant to cover these game-changing drugs, limiting patient access. This year, several politicians, including President Joe Biden, have called on pharma companies to slash the prices of GLP-1 drugs. In April, the HELP committee launched an investigation into Novo Nordisk’s high prices. Jørgensen agreed in June to testify in front of the committee, after Sen. Sanders called for a vote to subpoena the pharma executive. Here are the three main takeaways from today’s Senate committee hearing. In the U.S., the list price — a drug’s price without health insurance — for Ozempic is $968.52, while it’s just $59 in Germany. The list price of Wegovy in the U.S. is $1,349.02, despite being only $92 in the U.K. Novo Nordisk has made $50 billion in sales from Ozempic and Wegovy since 2018 — with 72% of that revenue coming from U.S. sales, Sen. Sanders said at today’s hearing. “In other words, the United States is Novo Nordisk’s cash cow for Ozempic and Wegovy,” Sen. Sanders said. Jørgensen pointed out that, at the pharmacy counter, the majority of patients with insurance pay $25 or less a month out-of-pocket for those medications. “Yes, millions of Americans with decent health insurance pay minimal amounts for their prescription drugs. That’s the good news,” Sen. Sanders responded. “The bad news is that they are paying a fortune in premiums, deductibles, and c0-payments for the insurance that covers those drugs.” Both sides agreed that PBMs, third-party administrators of prescription drug plans for health insurers, play a major role in keeping drug prices high. Jørgensen claimed Ozempic’s net price — the amount Novo Nordisk is actually paid by insurance companies after rebates and discounts are applied — has dropped about 40 percent in the U.S. since it launched in 2017. Wegovy, which launched in 2021, has seen its net price fall similarly. But those declines, which keep the price of these drugs hundreds of dollars more expensive in the U.S. than in other countries, have not been seen by patients. In the chief executive’s written testimony, Jørgensen claimed that “while PBMs negotiate low net prices for their corporate parents, those insurers design their plans such that nearly half of all patients’ out-of-pocket spending for brand medication is based on the full list price, with the insurer collecting the difference.” He also warned that lowering the drugs’ list prices could have unintended consequences, such as health insurers dropping them from their formularies. Sen. Sanders claimed he has received written agreements from major PBMs — including Express Scripts (CI), United Health Group (UNH), and CVS Caremark (CVS) — to not drop coverage of Ozempic and Wegovy if their list prices are drastically cut. Jørgensen agreed to work with PBMs and the committee to look into the possibility of price cuts, as long as they don’t affect patient access. “Anything that can help patients get access, I’m supportive of, and that also includes collaborating and negotiating with anyone who can help,” Jørgensen said. A Novo Nordisk spokesperson added, in a statement emailed to Quartz, “While no single company can fix the American healthcare system alone, we look forward to continuing to work with policymakers and other stakeholders toward meaningful solutions for the people who rely on our medicines.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s 2024 Election Plan: Make Facebook, Instagram Less Political

Time Published: 2024-09-24T16:43:43Z

Sports and celebrity news are now prioritized over election coverage on Meta’s social media platforms You may have noticed less political content on your Instagram and Facebook feeds this year — and that’s by design. Specifically, it’s the design of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who, according to The New York Times on Tuesday, wants his platforms to be less politically charged heading into the 2024 election. “On Facebook, Instagram and Threads, political content is less heavily featured,” the Times reported. “App settings have been automatically set to de-emphasize the posts that users see about campaigns and candidates.” Rather than political coverage, Meta’s apps are now more likely to recommend sports, cooking and celebrity news. That’s a stark change from four years ago, when Meta — then still under its original Facebook name — hit users with political news more frequently. The company, at the same time, actively policed content tied to the Trump-Biden election, as well as COVID-19. In mid-2020, Facebook started putting warning labels on posts from politicians and public figures that it deemed misinformation; the company also expanded its “hate speech” policy at the time. Zuckerberg, in the year leading up to the 2020 election, said he was “very focused on election security“; the company changed its rules around political ads, making it so American political advertisers had to have a U.S. address, for example. Facebook also had 40 teams, including an “election security” team, that partnered with Homeland Security, law enforcement and state and local election officials to oversee how the election was presented on Facebook and Instagram. That’s become less of a concern for Zuckerberg this time around. For instance, Zuckerberg no longer meets with his heads of election security on a weekly basis, the NYT reported, adding: “He has reduced the number of full-time employees working on the issue and disbanded the election integrity team … though the company says the election integrity workers were integrated into other teams.” Facebook was also active on the political front in the months after the 2020 election. Most notably, the company “indefinitely” banned Trump, saying the risk of having him on the platform was “simply too great” after the January 2021 Capitol Riot (Facebook and Instagram lifted all restrictions on Trump in July). One reason to expect Meta’s shift away from politics to continue: it hasn’t hurt business. The company’s stock price has nearly doubled since Election Day 2020, and is up 63% on the year to $564 per share. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Morgan Stanley: NVIDIA To Earn $10 Billion In Revenue From Blackwell Chips Alone In Q4 2024

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Wall Street is rapidly pivoting away from gnashing its proverbial teeth over NVIDIA's peaking margins just a few weeks back to now rushing to incorporate the Blackwell production ramp-up in its collective bullish thesis, replete with expectations of a phenomenal surge in revenue from the GPU manufacturer's latest flagship product. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the rumors of a Blackwell architecture design flaw had dominated the narrative around NVIDIA throughout the summer, with analysts contending that the flaw's rectification would relegate the Blackwell production ramp-up to a predominantly calendar year 2025 phenomenon. Then, while announcing its earnings for the June-ending quarter, NVIDIA confirmed the rumors of a minor design flaw but noted that the shortcomings were rectified by making a few minor changes to the photomask - a specific template that is used to create bespoke patterns on semiconductor wafers. Critically, the company announced at the time that it expected to start shipping Blackwell products in the December-ending quarter, with Hopper shipments also expected to increase. $NVDA Morgan Stanley says Hopper/Blackwell demand is strong - Nvidia’s Blackwell chips are now entering volume production, with demand from major customers driving significant growth potential for the company - The Hopper H200 chips are seeing increased demand from smaller… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) September 24, 2024 Now, Wall Street appears to be front-running NVIDIA's relatively cautious guidance by going a giant step forward. To wit, Morgan Stanley has now disclosed that it expects NVIDIA to ship 450,000 Blackwell chips in the December-ending quarter, earning ~$10 billion in revenue from this architecture alone: "Blackwell chips are expected to see 450,000 units produced in the fourth quarter of 2024, translating into a potential revenue opportunity exceeding $10 billion for NVIDIA." While Morgan Stanley concedes that NVIDIA is still in the process of resolving a few "technical challenges" with its GB200 server racks, the Wall Street titan posits a qualifier that such issues are a part of a "normal debugging process for new product launches." What's more, Morgan Stanley still sees a very healthy demand profile for NVIDIA's H200 chips, courtesy of sovereign AI projects and smaller cloud service providers continuing to expand their capacity.

Super League Gaming Inc. (NASDAQ:SLE) shares tumbled to a 52-week low this week, touching down at $0.52. The esports community and content platform has faced a challenging market environment, reflecting a broader downturn in tech and entertainment stocks. Over the past year, Super League Gaming has seen its stock price plummet, with a staggering 1-year change of -71.12%. This significant decline has brought the company's shares to their lowest point in the last year, underscoring the hurdles the company faces as it strives to pivot its strategy and regain investor confidence amidst a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In other recent news, Super League Gaming has released its Q2 2024 financial results, highlighting a strategic push toward profitability by Q4 2024. The company's operational progress is marked by a decrease in operating expenses and losses, and an expansion of partnerships and offerings. One significant collaboration is with Meta-Stadiums in the metaverse, aiming to create virtual stadiums. Despite flat revenues in Q2 2024 and delays in advertising campaigns due to inflation's impact on consumer spending, Super League Gaming has seen a decrease in operating expenses and losses. This indicates improved efficiency and a promising outlook for the company. The company has also launched immersive experiences with major brands such as the International Olympic Committee, Visa (NYSE:V), Maybelline, Claire's, Skechers, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Universal Pictures. These collaborations have led to high engagement and conversion rates. In further developments, Super League Gaming is focusing on transitioning repeat customers into long-term campaigns and setting annual booking records. The company's CEO, Ann Hand, expressed confidence in the company's strategy and its role in the future of immersive worlds as a media channel. Super League Gaming Inc. (SLE) has been navigating a turbulent period, as reflected in the company's recent market performance. According to InvestingPro data, the company's market capitalization stands at a modest 5.63 million USD, illustrating the scale of its financial footprint in the esports and entertainment industry. Despite the challenges, one of the InvestingPro Tips highlights that SLE holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide some financial flexibility in its strategic pivot. Additionally, the stock's recent movements suggest it is in oversold territory, based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), hinting at a potential undervaluation by the market. However, with a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of -0.08 and an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 at -0.23, investors are shown a company that is not currently generating profits relative to its share price. The revenue growth of 25.12% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 does provide a silver lining, indicating some level of business expansion despite the stock price's decline. It is also worth noting that the stock has been quite volatile, with a 1-week price total return of -22.3% and a 1-year price total return of -69.49%, which may deter risk-averse investors. For readers interested in a deeper analysis, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available on the platform, which could offer further insights into Super League Gaming's financial health and stock performance.

Title: 3 reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple stock – Needham
URL: https://macdailynews.com/2024/09/24/3-reasons-why-investors-should-remain-bullish-on-apple-stock-needham/

Update font size. Reset Needham & Company analysts have outlined three compelling reasons for investors to maintain a bullish outlook on Apple stock, even amidst concerns about the company’s reliance on the iPhone. These analysts believe that Apple’s strong “stable and liquid” fundamentals, huge share repurchase program, and the company’s strong cash position provide a solid foundation for continued growth and success. Sam Boughedda for Investing.com: ‎ The analysts note that while competitors like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are heavily investing in generative AI (GenAI) infrastructure with no immediate revenue boost, Apple stands out as a stable and liquid stock. Needham says Apple is actively reducing its equity base through share buybacks, which is expected to drive earnings per share (EPS) growth. The company’s $110 billion share repurchase authorization from May 2024 is projected to lead to 11% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025 and 12% in 2026, according to Needham estimates. Needham believes Apple’s commitment to achieving “net cash zero” from its current net cash position of about $50 billion, along with $91 billion in cash from operations reported in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, suggests accelerated share repurchases in the near future. ‎ MacDailyNews Note: Needham maintains a Buy rating on Apple with a target price of $260 per share, an upside of some 16% over the current price.

Title: The Quest 3 may undergo a significant pricing change
URL: https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/meta-could-discontinue-128gb-quest-3/
Time Published: 2024-09-24T15:46:40Z
Full Content:
Meta Connect 2024 is tomorrow, which means the much-leaked Meta Quest 3S is about to be revealed (we hope). Despite the event being only hours away, however, there are still more leaks to be had. The latest information, spotted by TechRadar, suggests that with the launch of the 3S, Meta will discount both Meta Quest 3 models and stop production of the 128GB model sometime in November. These leaks come from X (formerly Twitter) users CezaryXR, the editor-in-chief at XR Daily News, and Lunayian, who has posted multiple Quest 3S leaks before, including images of what appears to be marketing material for the 3S. Finally, later in March 2023 u/LuffySanKira on Reddit claims they were shown these &quot;Meta Quest 3s&quot; mockups in what was likely a User Research Zoom call. They were deleted shortly after. The account has an age of 3 years with little activity in VR, and is still active. 13/x 🧵 pic.twitter.com/kq0wTdDodz &mdash; Luna (@Lunayian) March 26, 2024 According to CezaryXR, there will be two models of the Quest 3S — a 128GB model priced at around $300 and a 256GB version for about $400. These prices are very similar to the Quest 2 and much lower than the Quest 3’s current $499 and $649 price tags. If the leak is accurate, Meta will also stop producing the 128GB Quest 3 model sometime in November, meaning it won’t be available to buy after stock runs out. At the same time, both Quest 3 models will get a discount — but we don’t know how low the prices will go. Exclusive Leak before Meta Connect: Meta will stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November, leaving only the 512GB variant. Both versions will be discounted until the 128GB stock runs out, after which only the 512GB model will be available. &mdash; Cezary Sobociński (@CezaryXR) September 23, 2024 Although a discount sounds like a good thing, in the long run, it could raise the price overall. Once 128GB stock runs out, people will have no choice but to buy the 512GB model — and with that much storage, it seems very unlikely that even its discounted price will be close to the cheaper model’s $499. Assuming the Quest 3S pricing estimates are accurate, that will leave buyers with three options: Our first thoughts in looking at these prices are that people would love the super affordable Quest 3S models, but sales for the Quest 3 would surely go down. It’s hard to believe that’s what Meta wants, so there’s definitely room for these leaks to be a little off. It’s all unofficial speculation anyway, so it’s always best to take it with skepticism The best part about this leak is that we only need to wait 24 hours to have the record set straight. Make sure to check our coverage of Meta Connect tomorrow for all the latest news on the Quest 3S and the fate of the Quest 3. An enhanced version of a Quest 3S leaked image reveals a possible design. LuffySanKira via Luna / Reddit via X Meta is expected to launch a new low-cost VR headset this year to replace the Meta Quest 2, the world's most popular VR headset. In what’s becoming a tradition for many electronic devices, we already have a good idea of what this new mixed reality headset will look like, its specifications, and more ahead of Meta's official announcement. Logitech has announced its first piece of hardware in the VR space, a stylus that lets you draw and paint in 3D on the Meta Quest 3. The MX Ink Stylus is a familiar-looking sketching tool that works hand in hand with the Quest controller to drastically expand the capabilities of the popular Quest 3 VR headset. The MX Ink also works with the Quest Pro and Quest 2 and supports several painting and sculpting Quest apps, including Gravity Sketch, PaintingVR, OpenBrush, ShapesXR, GestureVR, Arkio, and Engage XR. If you connect your Quest to a VR-ready PC, you can use the MX Ink Stylus with Adobe’s Substance Modeler and Elucis by Realize Medical. The Meta Quest 3 was already one of the best VR headsets for mixed reality, while keeping costs affordable. Soon Quest 3 owners will see a big upgrade that removes the distortion that sometimes broke the immersive feeling, simply by updating their headsets. Meta has announced the v66 software update that, among many things, comes with improvements to the Quest 3's passthrough cameras. Since the Quest 3’s passthrough cameras are located a couple of inches in front of your eyes, the headset must adjust the image to match your true perspective. Otherwise, everything would seem slightly zoomed in. Distant objects are easy, but nearby hands hide a portion of the background, presenting a challenge.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg is now in an exclusive club with only two other members: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos

It’s one thing to be a billionaire. Only 2,781 members of the world’s population, which is nearing 8 billion people, have reached that status. And even fewer people have a multibillion-dollar net worth, with a select few reaching the coveted $100 billion position. But now there’s an even more illustrious camp: the $200 billion club. And only three of tech’s biggest leaders have reached that summit: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and now, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, however, not only just broke into the $200 billion club—he’s also the biggest winner on the list having accumulated dozens of billions in wealth this year. Zuckerberg’s wealth has ballooned by an incredible $72.2 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, bringing his total net worth to $200 billion. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has had the second-biggest jump in net worth this year, gaining $58 billion in wealth. Growth aside, Musk has the highest net worth with $265 billion to his name, with Bezos tracking behind him at $216 billion. This places Zuckerberg ahead of other major tech executives including Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison and former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. “I define our strategy as if we can learn faster than every other company, we’re going to win,” Zuckerberg said during a taping of the Acquired podcast last week. “We’re going to build a better product than everyone else because we’re going to get it out first or early. You learn faster.” Read more from Fortune –Mark Zuckerberg says Europe needs more consistent AI regulation—and even his privacy nemesis agrees –In comments reigniting Tim Cook feud, Mark Zuckerberg declares Meta ‘the opposite’ of Apple –LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram are hoovering up your data to train their AI. Here’s how to stop it –Instagram unveils Teen Accounts with mandatory parental controls –Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla says AI will handle 80% of work in 80% of jobs While Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook 20 years ago, only takes a $1 salary, he makes up for it in “other compensation” and his massive stake in Meta. He’s the largest shareholder of Facebook’s parent company, owning about 345.5 million shares, according to Meta’s April proxy statement. Plus, he took home $24.4 million in “other compensation” this year. Much of that other compensation goes toward protecting Zuckerberg, much as with other high-profile CEOs. “We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg’s role puts him in a unique position: He is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” Meta wrote in the SEC filing. Meta did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment regarding Zuckerberg’s net worth. Meta, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, has performed well this year. Since the start of 2024, Meta’s stock is up a jarring 60%, and an even more impressive 85% year over year. It opened trade at more than $557 per share on Tuesday. Zuckerberg credits the company’s focus on AI for Meta’s strong performance this year. “Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,” Zuckerberg said in an earnings statement in July. Indeed, revenue rose 22% to $39.07 billion from $32 billion in Q2. While AI has been a boon for the company, Zuckerberg’s “Year of Efficiency” at Meta has been a challenge for many of its other workers and for some of its biggest projects, including augmented reality. This cost-cutting initiative started in February 2023 and has resulted in mass layoffs from the tech giant. “This decision is part of our larger efforts to prioritize the products we believe will best serve the future needs of our consumers and business customers alike,” Meta said in a statement. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Visa (V) shares fell Tuesday as the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued the payment processing giant over allegedly monopolistic behavior to protect its dominant position in the debit card market. "Visa has been the largest, most powerful debit network for over a decade," the DOJ wrote in the lawsuit, which was filed in Manhattan federal court. It alleged that the company's contracts with merchants "unlawfully inhibit competition and stifle innovation." An antitrust lawsuit led Visa and competing payment processor Plaid to abandon merger talks in January 2021. The DOJ said at the time that the planned $5.3 billion merger was an example of Visa's monopolistic behavior, as it looked to acquire a potential rival before it was large enough to effectively challenge it. "We are proud of the payments network we have built, the innovation we advance, and the economic opportunity we enable," said Visa General Counsel Julie Rottenberg in an email. "This lawsuit is meritless, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.” Bloomberg and The New York Times earlier reported a DOJ filing was imminent, causing Visa stock to trade lower throughout the session Tuesday. The shares closed down more than 5%. The lawsuit is the latest move from the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in recent years to use antitrust laws to block mergers and challenge dominant companies like Ticketmaster parent Live Nation (LYV), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL). Visa shares fell more than 5% to $273.76 soon before the closing bell Tuesday. They are up 5% this year. UPDATE: This story has been updated to note the filing of the lawsuit, add a statement from Visa, and update the share price.

Title: About 40% Of Jobs In U.S. Book Publishing Have Disappeared Since 1997
URL: https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/95996-over-30-years-40-of-publishing-jobs-disappeared-what-happened.html
Time Published: 2024-09-24T13:36:00Z

After a year when publishing industry layoffs have frequently been in the headlines, it will surprise no one that the total number of jobs in the industry is in decline. But in an era marked by corporate consolidation, increased competition for consumer attention, and the emergence of alternative publishing models, the most recent government data suggests the loss of publishing jobs over the past three decades has been dramatic. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of people employed in book publishing in the United States fell to 54,822 in 2023, down from 91,100 in 1997. If accurate, that represents a loss of about 40% of traditional publishing jobs in less than 30 years. The BLS stats are drawn from detailed employment data for book publishers, which, according to the agency, includes businesses that “carry out design, editing, and marketing activities necessary for producing and distributing books,” whether “in print, electronic, or audio form.” In 1990, the BLS recorded total book publishing employment at 85,800. Employment then peaked at 91,100 in June 1997, and was at 84,600 as late as December 2008. But the number of industry jobs appears not to have rebounded from the retooling that followed the Great Recession of 2007–2009. In 2012, employment had dropped to roughly 70,000, and in 2016 to approximately 60,000. The annual average bottomed out in 2021 at 51,161, down an eye-opening 44% from the BLS’s peak. In 2023—the most recent stats, released last month—employment has rebounded slightly, to 54,822. Notably, about 20% of publishing industry employment in 2016—10,269 jobs—was in New York City. In 2023, that number had slipped to 9,540, or about 17.4% of the publishing workforce. While government figures show that full-time employment in book publishing has been in decline since the 1990s, context is key. There have been significant shifts, including new technology and consolidation, that make it difficult to compare today’s publishing industry to the industry that existed three decades ago. For example, a 1992 report produced by Simba Information listed 20 companies across all publishing segments with sales of at least $200 million. Of those 20 publishers, 10 exist today, having swallowed up the other 10. And with every acquisition comes integration and a consequent net loss of jobs as companies improve their operating efficiencies. Indeed, publishing has become more efficient in the digital age. After all, despite the significant decline in publishing jobs, industry sales are still growing—although that growth is not keeping up with inflation, and even in absolute terms it appears to be slowing. During the 1990s, for example, sales growth in publishing exceeded 5% annually. By the early 2000s, it had slowed to about 1.5% per year and hit $25 billion in 2007, according to data from the Association of American Publishers. Meanwhile, the most recent AAP numbers show sales in 2023 were $29.9 billion. While publishing industry data is notoriously tricky to pin down given shifting accounting methods and data sources, the trend lines are nevertheless clear: book publishing employment has dropped by about a third, and sales have ticked up modestly. Certainly, profitability has improved. At the 2022 U.S. Book Show, Morgan Entrekin, longtime head of Grove Atlantic, pointed to the growing pressure on publishers—especially publicly traded ones—to deliver higher margins. “In 46 years, [trade book publishers have] never seen these levels of profitability,” he said, noting that historically, profit margins in the 5% range were seen as a healthy return. Today, the four of the Big Five trade publishers that report their financial results (next year it will be three with S&S now private) typically have margins above 10%. Traditional publishing has also ceded territory to new models. For example, digital self-publishing began to make its presence felt around 2007 with the launch of Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing. According to Bowker, in 2021 the number of self-published books—including e-books, print books, and digital audio—jumped to nearly three million, from just over 500,000 in 2011. Of course, self-publishing sales data is scarcer and more unreliable than data for the traditional publishing industry. Amazon recently revealed that in the 10 years Kindle Unlimited has been active, KDP authors have earned more than $3.5 billion in royalties, with more than $650 million of that coming in just the past 12 months. When you add in à la carte sales of self-published print and e-books by KDP authors as well as sales from other players in the self-publishing field, total self-publishing sales could be well north of $3 billion annually. But how many people would say they are employed in self-publishing? More to the point, where do they factor into publishing industry statistics? Few self-published authors are in the game full-time. And it is unlikely in any case that Amazon and the myriad other self-publishing companies (BookBaby, Draft2Digital, IngramSpark, and Lulu among them), which all run lean, have absorbed a significant number of the job losses reported by the BLS. Then there is the anecdotal evidence, which suggests that some of the “efficiency” realized by book publishers today has been achieved on the backs of staff: fewer full-time editors, designers, and production personnel, with more work shifted to the assistant level or outsourced to freelancers foreign and domestic—labor that would not be counted in the government’s statistics on publishing industry employment. With all the shifts of the past few decades, are the BLS stats an accurate portrait of the publishing industry job market? It’s hard to say. Surely no one in the industry would dispute that their ranks are shrinking, however. And what is certain is that the structure of employment in publishing has changed dramatically—a trend that is likely to continue. Loading...

Title: Novo Nordisk CEO blames drug 'middlemen' for high price of weight loss meds
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-congress-ceo-testimony-1851655576
Time Published: 2024-09-24T13:30:00Z

Novo Nordisk (NVO) CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen will shift the blame for the high prices of the company’s popular weight loss treatments to drug middlemen and the ‘complex’ U.S. health care system today during a committee hearing in Congress. Jørgensen is set to be grilled Tuesday morning by the the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP), chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders, over what the company charges for its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy in the U.S compared to other countries. “You have said that our amazing medicines can’t help patients if they can’t afford them. That is true,” Jørgensen plans to say during prepared opening remarks shared with Quartz. He adds, “it is clear that patients too often struggle to navigate the complex U.S. healthcare system. It is also clear that no single company can solve such vast and complicated policy changes.” In the chief executive’s written testimony, he goes on to specifically point the finger toward pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), third-party administrators of prescription drug plans for health insurers. Jørgensen wrote that the net price — the amount that Novo Nordisk is actually paid after manufacturer rebates and discounts are applied — of Ozepmic has dropped about 40 percent in the U.S., since it launched in 2017. Wegovy, which launched in 2021, has also seen its net price fall simlarily. However, “while PBMs negotiate low net prices for their corporate parents, those insurers design their plans such that nearly half of all patients’ out-of-pocket spending for brand medication is based on the full list price, with the insurer collecting the difference,” Jørgensen wrote. He warned that lowering the drugs’ list prices could have unintended consequences like health insurers dropping them from their formularies. The U.S. list price for Ozempic is $968.52 a month and $1,349.02 for Wegovy. In April, the HELP committee launched an investigation into the high prices the company charges for its blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs. The committee’s investigation found that the net cost of Ozempic in the U.S. is about $600 a month, well above the drug’s price in other countries. In Germany, for example, Ozempic costs just $59 for a month’s supply. Wegovy’s U.S. net price is $809, while it costs just $92 in the United Kingdom. Jørgensen agreed to testify in front of the committee in June, after Sen. Sanders called for a vote to subpoena the pharma executive. Last week, Sen. Sanders said that CEOs at major generic pharma companies have told him that they are willing to sell a generic version of Ozempic for less than $100.

Title: It's the 'year of the mandate' at offices, but hybrid and remote work aren't dying

Related Stories Amazon isn't the only major company cracking down on remote work — the tech giant joins other companies, including Citigroup, Walmart and UPS, in requiring workers to spend more time in offices in recent months. Even so, the share of people working remotely and hybrid has ticked up in the last year, while those working from an office full-time declined, according to a new report. Some 27% of workers say they work in a hybrid arrangement, up from 26% in 2023, according to a survey of 2,000 knowledge workers from Owl Labs, the video-conferencing technology maker. Another 11% say they work fully remotely, up from 7% in the last year, according to the report. The remaining 62% say they work from a physical office five days a week, down from 66% this time last year. It's "a surprise" to see remote and hybrid work increase slightly in what's shaping up to be "the year of the mandate," says Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Owl Labs. But hybrid workers continue to face challenges in what they want versus what their employers require. Most say they prefer to be in-office three days a week (33%) followed by two (20%), but the most common in-office schedules actually require three (41%) or four (32%) days a week. Companies are also increasing their efforts to track employees' attendance during the week. Nearly half of employees say their employer has added or increased the use of employee tracking software to gather activity data in the past year. And workers say their employers are stricter about enforcing attendance policies (like being fired for noncompliance) now, compared with 2022, according to data from WFH Research. However, "the issue with strict attendance policies is that they can become unenforceable," says Jose Maria Barrero, co-founder of WFH Research and assistant professor at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México Business School. "If employees work from home effectively, and there is no real reason for them to come into the office other than 'it is just the policy,' will managers really punish them?" he says. "Are you willing to piss off a good employee and potentially push them to find a different job if their work is otherwise up to standard?" Some business leaders may create strict office policies to get people to quit and avoid layoffs, he says, "but I'm skeptical that they would take a hard line if things are working well." On the employee side, there's been "a severe backlash" to many attendance and tracking efforts, says Deepali Vyas, the global head of fintech, payments and crypto practice at Korn Ferry. "Employees want autonomy and feeling like they're not being micromanaged." When set up effectively, tracking policies and tools can "enhance transparency and performance," Vyas says. "But I feel like it's a bit invasive. It can actually erode trust, which is something really crucial in any workplace." In fact, 73% of professionals say employee-tracking initiatives like monitoring badge swipes and computer activity are not necessary or helpful, according to a recent Glassdoor poll of 1,400 users. However, Weishaupt expects 2025 will see a continuation of more RTO mandates, tracking software and badging enforcement, despite Owl Labs' and other data indicating that "employees want flexibility," he says. "And I think that will create a trust barrier between employers and employees." Want to master your money this fall? Sign up for CNBC's new online course.

Title: Oppenheimer analysts initiate coverage of Pinterest with "Outperform" rating

Investing.com -- Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) has the smallest daily active user base among social media companies, but there is "upside" to the company stemming from engagement and advertising on the platform, according to analysts at Oppenheimer. In a note to clients on Tuesday, the analysts noted that Pinterest, which is known for its pinboards designed to spark ideas on everything from recipes to weddings, has the fastest-growing digital advertising offering outside of Instagram-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). "Pinterest operates a global discovery platform with high-intent users in search of products and inspiration, lending itself well to direct response advertising. Relevant ads improve the core user experience, like magazines, driving strong advertiser [return on investment]," the Oppenheimer analysts wrote. They initiated their coverage of the firm with an "Outperform" rating and a share price target of $45. "Ads drive increased engagement, which brings more advertisers, better data, more users, and higher ad pricing. More than half of users think of Pinterest as a place to shop, and 96% of searches are unbranded (e.g., “red dress”) further indicating access to unique inventory," the Oppenheimer analysts said. In July, Pinterest's stock price tumbled by around 15% after the company's third-quarter revenue guidance missed Wall Street expectations. The business said it now expects to post sales of $885 million to $900 million during the period, below estimates of roughly $907 million. However, Pinterest said it had 522 million global monthly active users in the second quarter, above analysts' forecasts, while quarterly average revenue per person of $1.64 met estimates. Speaking in a post-earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Julia Donnelly noted that Pinterest's "more sophisticated advertisers continue to lean into the platform," although she flagged "broader headwinds" are weighing on ad spending by food and beverage groups. In general, however, Pinterest executives said the market for advertising was "relatively stable" in the second quarter.

Title: Meta might soon cut the Meta Quest 3 price and discontinue the 128GB model

The Meta Quest 3S could shake things up more than we thought When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Update: It's confirmed, Meta has officially discontinued three of its VR headsets including the 128GB Meta Quest 3, though it is getting a price cut while it's still available. Original story continues below. As I’m writing this, Meta Connect 2024 is just a day away, which means we’re also just a day away from (hopefully) finally seeing the Meta Quest 3S in action – Connect is where many expect the much-leaked headset will make its debut. But its arrival could also be the end of one of the two Meta Quest 3 models, because leaks suggest the 128GB Quest 3 could be discontinued after the 3S launch. This comes from two sources, @CezaryXR – Editor-In-Chief at XRDailyNews – and @Lunayian – the source of most Quest 3S leaks, just ahead of Meta itself. CezaryXR claims that the Quest 3S will have two models: a 128GB variant at around $300 and a 256GB model at around $400; this matches the price in that supposed leaked Amazon ad, and aligns roughly with the Quest 2’s prices of $299 / £299 / AU$479 and $399 / £399 / AU$599 for its two models respectively. What’s more, Meta will also reportedly stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November – so when it sells out it won’t come back. Both current Quest 3 models (128GB and 512GB) will be discounted too. Exclusive Leak before Meta Connect:Meta will stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November, leaving only the 512GB variant.Both versions will be discounted until the 128GB stock runs out, after which only the 512GB model will be available.September 23, 2024 Lunayian shared the post adding they “heard similar whispers” – however neither source can confirm what prices the Meta Quest 3 headsets will fall to. In either case, it’s worth remembering to take these leaks with a pinch of salt, however they do support my one big piece of advice for anyone keen to buy a VR headset right now: wait. While I think a Quest 3 price drop makes sense (more on that below) whether it happens or not the Quest 3S looks set to be a headset at least worth considering – something you can’t do until it’s official. One question I’ve had about the Quest 3S is how its value proposition will stack up against the regular Quest 3. Yes the rumors say it’ll be bulkier, and have slightly worse specs in areas like its display and RAM – but still boast an identical processor – though as long as these downgrades don’t affect its performance too massively, the main deciding factor will be price. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. And here there’s a lot of room for error. Make the Quest 3S too pricey and the Quest 3 will remain a no-brainer upgrade killing the new model, make it too cheap and the regular Quest 3’s sales could tank – yes older models get replaced eventually, but VR headsets are not yet at the yearly refresh cycle of smartphones (and they shouldn’t be). This is why I was starting to convince myself the Quest 3S would start at around $350, or even $400 rather than being as cheap as the Quest 2 like many hoped. The strategy outlined in the leak above however is an alternative way to walk this pricing tightrope. Eliminating the cheaper Quest 3 helps to create more of a distinction between the Quest 3S models and the top of the line Quest 3, meaning we can have our super-affordable Quest 3S without as much risk of it cannibalizing its predecessor. Unfortunately, while the Meta Quest 3 will get a price drop according to the leaks, I suspect the 512GB model will land a little above the 128GB version’s current price of $499 / £479 / AU$799. If that’s the case, then when the 128GB model sells out the Quest 3 would get an effective price increase, which wouldn’t be ideal. We’ll have to wait and see what’s announced at Meta Connect 2024 and beyond, but if the leaks hold true I’d recommend trying to snatch up a 128GB Meta Quest 3 while you can as that’s looking like my pick for the best of the four Quest 3/3S models, and it might not be around for much longer.

China issued a series of stimulus measures to boost its hard-hit economy and housing market; U.S. stock futures are little changed after the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Monday at record highs; Boeing's (BA) "best and final" offer is rejected by its striking union workers; Novo Nordisk (NVO) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen faces a Senate hearing over the high cost of its weight-loss drugs; and Tesla (TSLA) shares are continuing to rise on Wall Street's optimism around its China and robotaxi operations. Here's what investors need to know today. China issued a broad stimulus package of monetary measures to boost a sluggish economy weighed down by a housing market slump and weak consumer sentiment. Beijing cut a key short-term interest rate, reduced rates on existing mortgages, lowered the amount banks need to set aside as reserves, and announced plans for at least 800 billion yuan ($114 billion) of liquidity to shore up the struggling stock market. Crude oil futures—under pressure from weak demand in the Asian nation—rose, while American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Chinese conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) are gaining 5% in premarket trading. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes closed up Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both finishing at fresh record highs. U.S. shares have been boosted in recent days by the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate cut in more than four years, and investors are now on watch for more Fed comments as officials say that upcoming economic data will determine the size of future rate cuts. Boeing (BA) offered what it called its "best and final" offer to workers who have been striking since mid-September, crippling the plane maker's operations. Boeing offered the striking members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union base wage increases of 30% over four years, up from its previous offer of a 25% increase. The union dismissed the offer in an X post, saying the contract "was thrown at us without any discussion." Novo Nordisk (NVO) ADRs are rising 1% in premarket trading ahead of a Senate hearing on the high costs of the Danish company's popular weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen is scheduled to testify today before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), which has accused the company of charging "outrageously high prices" for its treatments. Telsa (TSLA) shares are trading 1% higher in premarket trading after leading S&P 500 gainers Monday with an almost 5% jump, as analysts highlighted several potential catalysts that could provide a boost for the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer. Barclays analysts said that based on data points from China, Tesla could exceed expectations with its third-quarter vehicle deliveries, while analysts at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America also suggested Tesla could impress investors with its robotaxi event next month.

NVIDIA (NVDA) is experiencing strong demand for its Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. The investment bank said in a note Tuesday that Nvidia’s Blackwell chips are now entering volume production, with demand from major customers driving significant growth potential for the company. Morgan Stanley reports that Oracle recently announced plans to build a Zettascale AI supercluster powered by 131,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GPUs, delivering 2.4 ZettaFLOPS of AI performance. Oracle’s request for more GPU supply has provided a boost to Nvidia’s outlook, as well as to its suppliers in the semiconductor industry. "At a recent event, Oracle reportedly requested more GPU supply, which was upbeat news for the Asia AI semi/system supply chain," wrote the bank. Morgan Stanley now expects TSMC’s CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) capacity to increase to 80,000-90,000 wafers per month by 2025, up from a previous estimate of 70,000. In the near term, Nvidia’s Hopper GPU demand is said to remain strong, alleviating concerns about potential inventory risks. According to Morgan Stanley, the Hopper H200 chips are seeing increased demand from smaller cloud service providers and sovereign AI projects. Meanwhile, Blackwell chips are expected to see 450,000 units produced in the fourth quarter of 2024, translating into a potential revenue opportunity exceeding $10 billion for Nvidia. Morgan Stanley also notes that while Nvidia is still resolving some technical challenges with its GB200 server racks, these issues are part of the normal debugging process for new product launches. Hon Hai, Nvidia’s assembly partner, is reportedly on track to begin shipments of the GB200 server rack by late Q4 2024. Morgan Stanley maintains a bullish outlook on Nvidia’s AI supply chain, favoring it over memory, PC, and cloud segments as Nvidia continues to capitalize on the growing demand for AI semiconductors.

September 24, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Sept. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from three deep diamond drill holes completed at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. These results are part of Radisson’s ongoing and fully-funded 35,000 metre drill program, and represent the first deep drill holes of the current campaign. The three drill holes reported today represent an approximately 200 metre wide fence to the west, centre and east of the down-plunge extension of a high grade mineralization trend at the Project labeled “Trend 1.” The fence was located at a vertical depth of approximately 1,100 metres, 170 metres below the base of the existing Mineral Resource and below the level of the historic workings at the adjacent O’Brien mine. Of note, DDH OB-24-324, the central hole of the fence located directly below “Trend 1”, returned a wide intersection of high-grade mineralization with extensive visible gold (Figures 1, 2 & 3 and Tables 1 & 2). Results Highlights: Matt Manson, President & CEO, commented: “The results reported today represent a significant extension of high-grade mineralization at the O’Brien Project at depth. We have successfully intersected the down plunge extension of one of the principal high-grade gold trends at O’Brien. The 6-metre core interval of almost an ounce per tonne gold in OB-24-324, well mineralized throughout and with extensive visible gold, was achieved in the location predicted by our deposit model at a vertical depth of approximately 1,100 metres, a full 170 metres below previous drilling. For context, approximately 75% of our existing Mineral Resource is defined at depths above 600 metres. The two other deep holes reported today also intersected vein mineralization within alteration zones at the same depth, confirming the lateral continuity of the O’Brien mineralizing system generally and with noteworthy high-grade intercepts in OB-24-322 in particular. Taken together, this deep drilling is demonstrating the significant upside potential of the Project below the existing Mineral Resource. Two rigs are currently active, one targeting shallower targets within the existing Mineral Resource model, and one continuing to target deeper, down-plunge step-outs. We will be reporting additional drill results as they become available.” Figure 1: Long Section and Plan View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with DDH OB-24-321, 322 and 324 illustrated. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring adjacent to the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the Historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on the modern drilling, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.62 million tonnes at 8.64 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trends 0 to 5”, Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2). Table 1: Summary Assay Results from DDH OB-24-321, 322 and 324 Notes on Calculation of Drill InterceptsThe O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 3.00 g/t Au bottom cut-off, representing the lower limit of cut-off sensitivity presented in the March 2023 MRE. This methodology differs from previous Radisson disclosure, and intercepts reported in this release may not be directly comparable to historical published intercepts. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 40-80% of core length. Table 2 presents additional drill intercepts calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. Drill Hole OB-24-321 did not return any intercepts averaging above 3.00 g/t Au based on unofficial assays received to date (official assay certificates for three samples in OB-24-321, covering the interval italicised in Table 2, are pending). Lithology Codes: PON-S3: Pontiac Sediments; V3-S, V3-N, V3-CEN: Basalt-South, North, Central; S1P: Piché conglomerate; S3P: Piché sediments; POR-S, POR-N: Porphyry South, North. Today’s Drill Results Today’s results are from three drill holes over 3,660 metres in Trend 1. Visible gold was observed in each hole. Holes were drilled on northerly declinations at initial inclinations of between -77 and -85 degrees, providing a high angle of incidence with the southerly dip of the Piché Group rocks and the vein mineralization. Estimated true widths of drill intercepts at the point of contact with mineralization is estimated to be between 40 and 80% of core length.

Title: Costco shares downgraded to Hold at Truist amid valuation concerns

On Tuesday, Truist Securities adjusted its stance on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), moving from a Buy rating to Hold. The firm has set a price target for Costco at $873.00. The downgrade reflects a cautious view on the stock's current valuation despite the company's strong market position and its success in gaining market share across various retail segments. According to Truist Securities, Costco has established significant barriers to entry in the retail sector and continues to exhibit robust business performance. "However, some changes like the shift towards scanning IDs on entry and packaging changes to their chickens could add some sls headwinds, key catalysts are in the rearview mirror and the stock's valuation leaves little room for error," said Truist analysts in a note to cients. Additionally, Truist Securities notes that while Costco's stock has seen substantial growth, increasing by approximately 60% over the past 12 months compared to the S&P 500's 30% gain, the stock is now trading at around 54 times forward twelve-month earnings per share (EPS), which is considered a multi-decade high. The analysts from Truist Securities stated, "The business remains strong, it is gaining share vs. virtually all classes of trade and likely has the highest barriers to entry in all of retail, in our view." Despite this, the firm suggests that the major catalysts for Costco's stock performance have already occurred. In other recent news, Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) has made significant updates to its bylaws, introducing a cure process for shareholder director nominations. This move is part of a larger effort to refine the company's corporate governance practices and enhance communication with shareholders. Costco has seen considerable analyst activity and strong sales growth. Redburn-Atlantic revised its rating from "Buy" to "Neutral," citing concerns over the stock's valuation, despite raising the price target to $890. Oppenheimer, Stifel, and Baird maintained positive ratings, with Oppenheimer and Stifel raising their price targets to $955 and $915 respectively, due to robust sales growth and positive earnings estimates. Costco reported a 6.7% rise in U.S. comparable sales and a significant 23.3% growth in consolidated e-commerce sales. The company's non-foods category experienced a low double-digit increase, contributing to the robust performance. Baird maintained an Outperform rating with a consistent price target of $975, emphasizing Costco's steady global core comparable sales and a slight increase in its fourth-quarter earnings per share forecast. As investors digest the cautious stance from Truist Securities on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), a glance at the real-time data from InvestingPro provides additional context for the stock's current valuation. Costco holds a significant market capitalization of $406.57 billion, with a high Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 56.7, which aligns with Truist's concerns about the stock trading at a multi-decade high earnings multiple. Despite the high valuation, Costco's revenue growth remains robust, with a 7.75% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024. From an operational standpoint, Costco's gross profit margin stands at 12.5%, a figure that may raise some eyebrows considering the InvestingPro Tip that highlights the company's weak gross profit margins. However, investors might find solace in the company's ability to maintain dividend payments for 21 consecutive years, coupled with a strong return over the last year, which could signal a continued commitment to shareholder returns despite the high valuation metrics. For those seeking more detailed analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips, including insights on Costco's cash flow capabilities and its position within the Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail industry.

Title: 3 reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple stock: Needham

Investing.com -- Needham & Company analysts provided three key reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock despite concerns about its dependence on the iPhone. The firm maintained a Buy rating on the stock in a note Tuesday, with a target price of $260 per share, representing a 16% upside. A Liquid Stock During Uncertainty: The analysts note that while competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are heavily investing in generative AI (GenAI) infrastructure with no immediate revenue boost, Apple stands out as a stable and liquid stock. In a volatile market, they argue that investors need a reliable stock to "hide in" during 2025, making Apple an attractive option. Share Repurchases Driving EPS Growth: Needham says Apple is actively reducing its equity base through share buybacks, which is expected to drive earnings per share (EPS) growth. The company's $110 billion share repurchase authorization from May 2024 is projected to lead to 11% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025 and 12% in 2026, according to Needham estimates. This continued buyback strategy is expected to support the bullish outlook for Apple. Strong Cash Position Enables Further Buybacks: Needham believes Apple's commitment to achieving "net cash zero" from its current net cash position of about $50 billion, along with $91 billion in cash from operations reported in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, suggests accelerated share repurchases in the near future. This financial strategy is expected to further enhance shareholder returns. Despite concerns about Apple's reliance on the iPhone and its slower pace of GenAI adoption compared to peers, Needham & Company believes Apple's financial discipline and stock buyback strategy make it a strong investment opportunity.

Title: A Rebound To $200 For Roku Stock?

Time Published: 2024-09-24T10:00:00Z

SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 18: Roku's company logo is seen in front of Roku headquarters on ... [+] November 18, 2022 in San Jose, California. Roku announced plans to lay off 200 employees in the United States, or nearly 7 percent of its workforce. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Roku stock (NASDAQ: ROKU), a company that sells streaming media players, digital content, and advertising, has seen its stock decline by close to 17% this year, trading at levels of about $76 per share. This compares to Netflix stock, (NASDAQ: NFLX), which has gained about 44% over the same period. Roku has been weighed down by a mixed advertising market and slowing growth of its platform business. Roku stock currently trades at just about 2.8x forward revenues and 3.2x trailing revenues. Roku remains in the red, with profits likely to remain elusive this year. Does this make the stock expensive? Probably not. In fact, we think Roku stock has the potential to rise close to 3x in the next few years. Now the decrease in ROKU stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were -31% in 2021, -82% in 2022, and 125% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. But how could Roku possibly regain its footing and rise again? Let’s delve into the company’s revenue prospects to begin with. Roku’s revenue growth is expected to remain modest this year, rising by about 14%, from $3.5 billion in 2023 to $4 billion in 2024. This reflects challenges in the digital advertising market and a shift toward more affordable streaming plans, which has impacted Roku’s platform revenue. However, growth could accelerate to around 25% between 2024 and 2027, touching $7 billion levels. So why the potential rebound in revenue growth? Roku’s platform monetization could improve significantly. Engagement on Roku devices has remained strong, with total streaming hours up 20% in the latest quarter. The Roku Channel, its proprietary streaming service, has also seen a 75% year-over-year jump in streaming hours, becoming one of the leading free, ad-supported platforms in the U.S. This channel is poised to boost higher-margin advertising revenue. Additionally, Roku has been enhancing its ad capabilities by partnering with major ad-tech players like The Trade Desk, enabling more precise targeting and optimization. Additionally, with the recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, U.S. consumer spending could pick up and this could drive a revival in their advertising expenditure in the coming quarters, thus helping Roku’s top line. Roku Could Turn Profitable Roku has been continuously loss-making in recent years, and the company is looking to cut costs aggressively. Over the first six months of this year, the company’s operating costs fell by about 10% driven by workforce and office space reductions in 2023. Roku is also generating more cash. Free cash flow stood at over $300 million for the trailing 12 months. As the company’s past investments in R&D and product development start paying off and as Roku’s business gains scale, it can boost margins meaningfully. For perspective, other companies in the advertising and media space such as the Trade Desk and Netflix had net margins of approximately 10% to 18% respectively, in recent quarters. If we assume that Roku can boost margins to about 10%, and factor in our revenue projections of roughly $7 billion by 2027, a net income of $700 million is possible by 2027. Roku’s Multiple Could Expand Now if Roku’s revenues grow 2x by 2027, the P/S multiple will shrink to half of its current level, assuming the stock price stays the same, correct? But that’s exactly what Roku investors are betting will not happen! If revenues expand 2x over the next few years, instead of the P/S shrinking from around 3x presently to less than 1.5x, a scenario where the P/S actually rises is possible. Why? Netflix trades at a P/S of about 8x, while The Trade Desk trades at about 20x. Moreover, Roku stock itself traded at levels of over 30x revenue during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now if we assume that Roku’s P/S multiple expands to about 5x, considering higher revenue growth and profitability, this would mean that revenue would grow about 2x, while the P/S multiple would rise by about 1.66x. This in turn could 3x the stock from levels of about $76 presently to over $220. What about the time horizon for this positive-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2027 timeline, in practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or four. If the turnaround takes hold, we could see meaningful gains in the stock. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Title: Bernard Arnault plummets down the list of world’s richest men after a $54 billion collapse
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/bernard-arnault-richest-man/
Time Published: 2024-09-24T09:00:00Z

“As long as I’m not the richest man in the world, I won’t really be happy,” Bernard Arnault once said. The day has come. Arnault, the founder and CEO of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, went from being the richest person in the world to the fifth-most after a 20% drop in his company’s stock price, resulting in a $54 billion cut of his net worth. Arnault, who oversees dozens of prestigious brands including Moët Hennessy, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, and Fendi, was worth an estimated $231 billion in late March, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That placed him ahead of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. As of Monday, Arnault was worth an estimated $177 billion. Now, Arnault ranks lower than each of those executives, plus Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. In the past year, LVMH stock has dropped over 16%, and is currently trading at about $132 per share; Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate. Since the start of 2024, Arnault’s net worth is down $30 billion, making him the biggest loser on the list year-to-date. LVMH did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment. During the first half of 2024, LVMH reported a modest dip in revenues, but its wine and spirits divisions fared even worse. “Maybe the current global situation, be it geopolitical or macroeconomic, doesn’t lead people to cheer up and open bottles of champagne,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s chief financial officer, said during the company’s earnings call in late July. “I don’t really know. The matter of fact is, is that our volumes are down double digits.” But it’s not just LVMH that’s had a tough time in today’s market. Other major luxury brands and holding houses have reported losses this year. In fact, luxury revenues were flat during Q2 2024, the slowest growth in 15 quarters, according to a Bank of America note about luxury goods released Monday. Demand deteriorated during July, and August and September have also slowed. Michael Kors, housed under Capri Holdings, saw its first quarter revenue drop more than 14% year-over-year, according to Capri’s first quarter fiscal 2025 results posted Aug. 8. “Sometimes you’ll be the hottest thing on the block,” Michael Kors said in his testimony during an $8.5 billion antitrust trial involving Capri Holdings and Tapestry. “Sometimes you’ll be lukewarm. Sometimes you’ll be cold.” While Arnault has lost a tremendous amount of wealth this year as the result of the struggling luxury market, with a net worth of $177 billion, he’s still wealthier than former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, as well as Warren Buffett, Michael Dell, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Plus, Arnault has stayed active in investing this year. His family office has invested in five AI-focused startups this year amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. Plus, in July, he joined the chase to acquire Venice’s iconic Hotel Bauer for $305 million—but got outbid. Arnault, 75, isn’t ready to leave his post: He forced his board to extend the retirement age for its chairman and CEO from 75 to 80 so he could stay longer. But he received a letter from 93-year-old Warren Buffett saying he should’ve made the age limit higher, according to Bloomberg. Still, Arnault says he’s working 12-hour days. “Every morning I have fun when I arrive,” Arnault told Bloomberg. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Kazakhstan Says Second-Largest Lender Is Compliant With Sanctions Despite Critical Report
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/kazakh/2024/kazakh-240923-rferl01.htm
Time Published: 2024-09-24T07:10:40Z

By Chris Rickleton September 23, 2024 ALMATY -- Kazakhstan has defended the country's second-largest lender as being "fully" compliant with sanctions against Russia after a scathing report saw around 20 percent wiped off the Nasdaq-listed Kaspi.kz's stock price. A September 19 report published by Culper Research poured doubt on the claim by fintech giant Kaspi that it lacks exposure to sanctions-struck Russia and raised concerns about the group's past affiliations to a relative of former President Nursultan Nazarbaev who was convicted by a Kazakh court of major embezzlement in 2022. In a September 19 statement, Kaspi.kz called Culper's report "misleading" and "inaccurate." The report, Kaspi.kz (KSPI): The NASDAQ-Listed Fintech Moving Money For Criminals And Kleptocrats, focused on Kaspi.kz's issuance of bank cards to Russians, tens of thousands of whom arrived in Kazakhstan in the wake of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. "As the U.S. and other nations continue to broaden sanctions against those found to be aiding Russia's wartime economy, we believe Kaspi now risks secondary sanctions," the report warned, justifying its "short" position on the company. Kaspi.kz is widely viewed as a success story in Kazakhstan, going from a relatively obscure bank to the country's leader in mobile payments and online marketplace services in some 20 years. In a September 23 statement, Kazakhstan's Agency for Regulation and Development of Financial Markets called Kaspi "one of the country's systemically important and steadily developing banks, demonstrating sustainable growth and a high level of transparency." "The bank fully complies with the sanctions regime of the U.S., the European Union, and other foreign countries," the agency said, referring to the sanctions imposed on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The main shareholders in Kaspi.kz are Kazakh billionaire Vyacheslav Kim, Georgia-born Mikhail Lomtadze, and Baring Funds, part of a Commonwealth of Independent States-focused private equity investor. Kaspi.kz listed in 2020 on the London Stock Exchange to become the its largest international tech public offering that year. In January it joined the Nasdaq in an initial public offering that saw the business valued at $17.5 billion. "Being the first company from Kazakhstan to successfully list on Nasdaq has obviously raised our profile amongst short sellers," Kaspi.kz said in its statement. Nazarbaev's nephew, Kairat Satybaldy, who once held a stake of around 30 percent in Kaspi, exited the company prior to the successful listings. In August, Lomtadze, who is CEO of Kaspi.kz, declared the company's intention to compete in the forthcoming privatization of Humo, neighboring Uzbekistan's state-backed payment system. In May, Lomtadze was revealed as the new owner of Wycombe Wanderers, a third-tier English soccer club.

A report by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) is calling out some of the world’s biggest companies, saying they undermine democracy worldwide. The ITUC says its mission is “the promotion and defence of workers’ rights and interests, through international cooperation between trade unions, global campaigning and advocacy within the major global institutions.” Tune in: How Major U.S. Firms Got Branded as Undermining Democracy! The ITUC has published a list calling out the top seven “emblematic companies that benefit financially by continuing to violate trade union and human rights, monopolise media and technology, exacerbate climate catastrophe, and privatise public services. They represent a wider corporate world that protects and expands its own profits by undermining democracy.” The list includes: The organization then goes on to describe why each company made it on to the list. ITUC calls out Amazon for its repeated privacy violations, worker endangerment, and opposition to labor laws. The world’s largest online retailer and cloud computing service, and its fifth-largest employer, there is no industry or community Amazon and its subsidiaries have not adversely impacted. The company has become notorious for its union busting and low wages on multiple continents, monopoly in e-commerce, egregious carbon emissions through its AWS data centres, corporate tax evasion, and lobbying at national and international level. In the United States alone, where Amazon’s worker injury rate is twice as high as similar companies, the company has racked up more than US$250 million in fines for privacy, occupational health and safety, wage, and environmental violation cases filed by workers across sectors. Attempts to hold Amazon accountable to labour rights have led the company to challenge the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board in the U.S. In Canada, the company is trying to overturn provincial labour law. In Europe, Amazon was barred this year from lobbying within the European Parliament for its refusal to attend hearings on violations of worker rights in its warehouses, becoming only the second company in history to face such a sanction. Its refusal to negotiate with unions in Germany has resulted in a decade of strikes. In India, the company has admitted to breaching workplace safety standards in its warehouses. Blackstone Group makes the list for opposition to violations of consumer protection laws, violating employment laws, employing child labor, and harming the environment, including deforestation of the Amazon. Blackstone is well-known by climate justice advocates for its role in the rapid deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and huge investments in fossil fuel projects. In the UK, Blackstone reaped huge profits while saddling one of the country’s largest long-term care providers with insurmountable debt. Blackstone infamously profited from housing market speculation after the 2008 financial crisis and aggressively evicted workers after the Covid-19 pandemic. Blackstone and its subsidiaries have been penalised for competition, contracting, employment, financial and consumer protection violations to the tune of nearly US$300 million in one country alone. It was also the face of child labour in meatpacking, is known for its exorbitant fees to manage worker pensions, and has so far failed to sign up to a coalition-designed Private Equity Labor Rights Platform. In Brazil, it has been criticised for helping to privatise public infrastructure and corporatise agricultural land. Blackstone seems to believe that it – not voters – should determine public policy. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on housing has accused Blackstone of, “using its significant resources and political leverage to undermine domestic laws and policies that would in fact improve access to adequate housing.” ExxonMobil’s inclusion on the list should come as a surprise to no one, given the company’s long history of hiding its finding about the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Perhaps the greatest example of Exxon’s disinterest in democratic deliberation was its corporate commitment of nearly four decades to conceal from the public its own internal evidence that climate change was real, accelerating, and driven by fossil fuel use while simultaneously financing far-right think tanks in the US and Europe to inject climate scepticism and denialism into the public discourse. While it altered its public position on climate change years ago, Exxon continues to lobby against meaningful climate policy and still promotes fossil fuel and plastics use to the detriment of communities around the world. It benefits from another entry on our list, Meta, by spreading right-wing propaganda in favour of fossil fuels. It finances the Republican Attorneys General Association, which has led efforts to pressure the US Supreme Court to throw out climate change lawsuits seeking damages from Exxon and its competitors. Glencore has a track record of flaunting the law, pleading guilty to various charges in a number of countries. The largest trader of commodities and the largest mining company in the world by revenue, Glencore controls or produces huge portions of the global supply of coal, zinc, cobalt, and other minerals, metals, fuels and foods. The company’s undermining of democracy is not in dispute, as it has in recent years pled guilty to committing bribery, corruption, and market manipulation in countries as varied as Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and South Sudan. The scale of Glencore’s global lobbying lays bare the organisational conviction that it, rather than the voting public, should determine policy. While it publicly shows itself to support measures such as the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, for years it has made use of right-wing consultants to spend “millions bankrolling a secret, globally coordinated campaign to prop up coal demand by undermining environmental activists, influencing politicians and spreading sophisticated pro-coal messaging on social media.” This self-serving posture is also exhibited in its efforts to undermine popular climate policy in the European Union, the United States, and South Africa. Meta’s role in politics and its ability to influence people, including its users falling victim to misinformation, has long made the company the target of critics and led to its inclusion on the list. The world’s largest social media company, Meta is the parent of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger. Combined, these products have nearly four billion users – the same number of people estimated to be voting worldwide in 2024. The company’s scale, and its corporate behaviour, have led some to call it “a foreign state, populated by people without sovereignty, ruled by a leader with absolute power.” Meta’s algorithms can quite literally alter humanity’s perceptions of reality. Its revenue model exploits trillions of personalised data points to deliver highly effective advertising to its users. That has made it a perfect target for data breaches seized on by authoritarians and an ideal vessel for right-wing political parties to spread propaganda around the world. Violent, far-right militias in the US use Facebook to recruit new members. In Germany, the far-right AfD used Facebook to stoke anti-immigrant hatred and position itself for unprecedented success in June’s European parliamentary elections. While Tesla may be the world’s leading EV maker, that standing has come at the expense of workers rights, with the company engaging in a long history of combating unionization efforts. In Germany, Sweden, and the US, Tesla has aggressively violated the right to organise, refused to engage in collective bargaining, and provoked unprecedented strike action for its subversion of social dialogue, a pillar of industrial democracy in many European economies. Tesla’s hostility toward unions earned it a place on a list of Worst Union-Busters of 2023. Tesla’s factories have “reported ten times more safety violations than Nissan … despite the fact that Nissan built almost ten times as many cars over the same period.” But Tesla does not limit its efforts to weaken democratic norms in highly industrialised economies. Its supply chain relies on nickel mining companies that undermine consultation standards with local Indonesian communities and are deforesting so rapidly that flooding and water pollution threaten neighbourhoods. The company’s supply chain relies on another corporation on our list, Glencore, to mine copper and cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where child labour has allegedly been employed. The Vanguard Group makes the list for concentrating its power to such a degree that even its founder was worried about where the company was headed. One of the “Big Four” institutional investors in the world alongside BlackRock, Fidelity, and State Street, Vanguard’s holdings put it “into an extreme position of power” at many of the companies it funds and makes it “the voice that matters most among investors.” This concentration of power troubled even Vanguard’s late founder, John Bogle, who wrote in 2018 that “If historical trends continue, a handful of giant institutional investors will one day hold voting control of virtually every large US corporation.” Despite holding billions of dollars in worker money, Vanguard recently abandoned one of its most public commitments to environmental and social governance. After signing on to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2021, it left in 2022, bowing to pressure from its far-right friends and provoking a backlash from more than 1,000 of its more climate-friendly clients. The ITUC’s list, and the cases it makes, is a damning indictment of the included companies. The ITUC minces no words in calling out the seven companies for their actions. These companies deploy complex lobbying operations to undermine popular will and disrupt existing or nascent global policy that could hold them accountable. They are invariably led by ultra-wealthy individuals that support and finance far-right politicians and parties to further their own interests. When the far-right wins power, it discredits and defunds democratic global institutions; reduces taxes on the wealthy and on corporations; undercuts living wages; favours bilateral aid financing over multilateralism; and cracks down on human, trade union, and democratic rights, as evidenced by the ITUC’s Global Rights Index. If more organizations continue to shine a spotlight on the actions of the companies on the list, public perception could eventually force them to change how they do business.

Title: Amazon, ExxonMobile, Meta, Tesla, Others Labeled ‘Underminers of Democracy’
URL: https://www.webpronews.com/amazon-exxonmobile-meta-tesla-others-labeled-underminers-of-democracy/
Time Published: 2024-09-24T03:47:04Z
Full Content:
A report by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) is calling out some of the world’s biggest companies, saying they undermine democracy worldwide. The ITUC says its mission is “the promotion and defence of workers’ rights and interests, through international cooperation between trade unions, global campaigning and advocacy within the major global institutions.” Tune in: How Major U.S. Firms Got Branded as Undermining Democracy! The ITUC has published a list calling out the top seven “emblematic companies that benefit financially by continuing to violate trade union and human rights, monopolise media and technology, exacerbate climate catastrophe, and privatise public services. They represent a wider corporate world that protects and expands its own profits by undermining democracy.” The list includes: The organization then goes on to describe why each company made it on to the list. ITUC calls out Amazon for its repeated privacy violations, worker endangerment, and opposition to labor laws. The world’s largest online retailer and cloud computing service, and its fifth-largest employer, there is no industry or community Amazon and its subsidiaries have not adversely impacted. The company has become notorious for its union busting and low wages on multiple continents, monopoly in e-commerce, egregious carbon emissions through its AWS data centres, corporate tax evasion, and lobbying at national and international level. In the United States alone, where Amazon’s worker injury rate is twice as high as similar companies, the company has racked up more than US$250 million in fines for privacy, occupational health and safety, wage, and environmental violation cases filed by workers across sectors. Attempts to hold Amazon accountable to labour rights have led the company to challenge the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board in the U.S. In Canada, the company is trying to overturn provincial labour law. In Europe, Amazon was barred this year from lobbying within the European Parliament for its refusal to attend hearings on violations of worker rights in its warehouses, becoming only the second company in history to face such a sanction. Its refusal to negotiate with unions in Germany has resulted in a decade of strikes. In India, the company has admitted to breaching workplace safety standards in its warehouses. Blackstone Group makes the list for opposition to violations of consumer protection laws, violating employment laws, employing child labor, and harming the environment, including deforestation of the Amazon. Blackstone is well-known by climate justice advocates for its role in the rapid deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and huge investments in fossil fuel projects. In the UK, Blackstone reaped huge profits while saddling one of the country’s largest long-term care providers with insurmountable debt. Blackstone infamously profited from housing market speculation after the 2008 financial crisis and aggressively evicted workers after the Covid-19 pandemic. Blackstone and its subsidiaries have been penalised for competition, contracting, employment, financial and consumer protection violations to the tune of nearly US$300 million in one country alone. It was also the face of child labour in meatpacking, is known for its exorbitant fees to manage worker pensions, and has so far failed to sign up to a coalition-designed Private Equity Labor Rights Platform. In Brazil, it has been criticised for helping to privatise public infrastructure and corporatise agricultural land. Blackstone seems to believe that it – not voters – should determine public policy. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on housing has accused Blackstone of, “using its significant resources and political leverage to undermine domestic laws and policies that would in fact improve access to adequate housing.” ExxonMobil’s inclusion on the list should come as a surprise to no one, given the company’s long history of hiding its finding about the impact of fossil fuels on the environment.

Title: What You Need to Know About Super Micro's 10-for-1 Stock Split
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-you-need-to-know-super-micro-computer-stock-split-8716990
Time Published: 2024-09-23T20:54:05Z

Server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) announced a 10-for-1 stock split last month that will take effect after the closing bell on Sept. 30. Here's what you need to know about the split. Shareholders will receive nine new Super Micro shares for every one they already own. Their overall stake in the company won’t change, but the stock will subsequently trade for 10% of its previous price. In other words, if Super Micro shares were trading at $1,000 before the split, an investor holding one share before the split would hold 10 shares priced at $100 each after the split. (Companies can also hold reverse splits, as some have done lately.) Super Micro shares skyrocketed early in 2024 to a high of nearly $1,200 due to surging demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. They traded closer to $600 when the split was announced, and closed Monday at about $465. The shares have lost more than half their value over the past six months, thanks in part to disappointing recent results. Even so, the stock is still roughly 65% higher year-to-date. The move would be the latest split by a high-flying tech stock, with Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) having already split their shares 10-for-1 this year.

Title: Why Some Analysts Say Qualcomm's Potential Takeover of Intel is 'Impractical'
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/qualcomm-reportedly-approached-intel-about-a-takeover-analysts-are-skeptical-8716846
Time Published: 2024-09-23T20:47:06Z

Intel (INTC) shares have gained ground as investors reacted to a Wall Street Journal report late Friday that said Qualcomm (QCOM) had made a “takeover approach” to the beleaguered chipmaker. However, securities analysts are less keen on the idea, with those at Bank of America calling it “intriguing but perhaps impractical.” A Qualcomm takeover could offer Intel a lifeline for its struggling foundry business, which produces chips for outside customers, the firm noted in a research note released on Saturday. Intel could fill its manufacturing facilities with Qualcomm products, and Qualcomm could become a significant customer for Intel’s silicon wafers. That said, Intel is saddled with more than $50 billion in debt, and Qaulcomm has just $13 billion in cash on its balance sheet, making a takeover deal difficult, the BofA analysts said. In addition, the move could “create confusion given potential for headcount and roadmap disruptions,” making such a merger a potential boon for rivals such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). For a Qualcomm-Intel deal to go through, it likely would require a level of buy-in from the U.S. and Chinese governments, analysts at JPMorgan wrote over the weekend. Qualcomm could look for the U.S. government to provide a capital commitment to the foundry business, the success of which is important to domestic semiconductor production. Then there’s regulatory approval from China, which analysts acknowledge would be a major obstacle for such a move. The country "historically has taken years to even consider medium sized transactions," the BofA analysts said. Over the weekend, Apollo Global Management offered to invest as much as $5 billion in Intel, according to a Bloomberg report. Intel previously agreed to sell Apollo a 49% stake in a chipmaking site in Ireland in June. Shares of Intel gained 3.3% on Monday, while Qualcomm stock was down 1.8%.

Title: Mastercard CMO sells over $2.2m in company stock

Full Content:
Venkata R Madabhushi, the Chief Marketing Officer of Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), has recently engaged in significant trading activity involving the company's stock. According to a recent filing, Madabhushi sold a total of 4,685 shares of Mastercard's Class A Common Stock at an average price of approximately $489.86, resulting in a transaction value of over $2.2 million. The sale took place on September 20, 2024, and was executed in multiple trades with prices ranging from $489.18 to $490.00. The reported average sales price represents a weighted average, reflecting the various prices at which the stock was sold. Following this transaction, Madabhushi's direct ownership in the company decreased to 15,030.79 shares. In a separate transaction on the same day, Madabhushi also exercised options to acquire 2,598 shares of Mastercard stock at a price of $344.48 per share, totaling nearly $895,000. This transaction was carried out under a pre-planned trading plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allows company insiders to set up a predetermined plan to buy or sell company stock. The plan was adopted on June 14, 2024, for personal financial management purposes. The filing also disclosed details about Madabhushi's employee stock options. As of the reporting date, he was awarded 8,054 employee stock options on March 1, 2022. Of those, 299 have vested and the remaining 2,685 are set to vest on March 1, 2025. These transactions provide insight into the trading behavior of one of Mastercard's top executives and are disclosed to the public as part of the company's commitment to transparency regarding the ownership and dealings of its insiders. Interested parties can request detailed information on the number of shares sold and the specific prices from the SEC, the issuer, or a security holder of the issuer, as the reporting person has undertaken to provide full information upon request. In other recent news, Mastercard has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 66 cents per share and announced a strategic acquisition of Recorded Future, a global leader in threat intelligence, for $2.65 billion. This acquisition, expected to contribute to Mastercard's revenue growth and diversification of services, has received positive outlooks from analyst firms Baird, BMO Capital Markets, and TD Cowen, while Compass Point has given Mastercard a Neutral rating. Simultaneously, Mastercard has priced new note issuances, including a $750 million note due in 2028 at 4.10%, a $1.15 billion note due in 2032 at 4.35%, and a $1.10 billion note due in 2035 at 4.55%. Baird suggests these issuances will likely have a negligible or neutral effect on the company's earnings per share. In a separate development, Safaricom, Kenya's leading telecommunications company, has partnered with Mastercard to enhance payment acceptance and cross-border remittance services in Kenya. This partnership is expected to leverage Safaricom's M-PESA's extensive merchant network and Mastercard's international payment infrastructure, potentially boosting Kenya’s payment acceptance market growth. The first initiatives of this partnership are expected to be rolled out in the coming months. These are the recent developments in Mastercard's strategic and financial landscape. Amidst the insider trading activity at Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), it's important for investors to consider the broader financial landscape of the company. Mastercard, a prominent player in the Financial Services industry, is not only known for its operational success but also for its consistent shareholder returns. The company has raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years, showcasing a strong commitment to returning value to its investors. InvestingPro Data reveals that Mastercard boasts a market capitalization of $459.17 billion, reflecting its substantial presence in the market. Despite recent insider sales, the company's stock has been trading near its 52-week high, with a price percentage of 99.04% of that peak. This indicates a robust performance in the stock market and investor confidence in the company's prospects. However, it's worth noting that Mastercard is trading at a high earnings multiple, with a P/E ratio of 37.85 and an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 sitting at 36.21. This high valuation could suggest that the stock is priced optimistically relative to its near-term earnings growth. Moreover, the company's Price/Book multiple during the same period is at 61.89, which is considered high and might raise valuation concerns for value-focused investors. For those looking to delve deeper into Mastercard's financial health and future prospects, the InvestingPro platform offers numerous additional tips. Currently, there are 11 more InvestingPro Tips available, which could further inform investment decisions.

Title: Intel needs Qualcomm, but it's not a two-way street, analysts say

Time Published: 2024-09-23T18:42:00Z

After missing second-quarter earnings expectations and seeing its stock fall over 50% so far this year, Intel (INTC) is still attracting interest worth billions of dollars. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) is reportedly interested in taking over the chip pioneer in a deal that could be worth $90 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. And alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) has also offered an equity-like investment that could be worth as much as $5 billion, according to Bloomberg. By taking over Intel, Qualcomm could potentially scale, gain leadership in the market for mobile, PC, and server core processor units, or CPUs, and have access to Intel’s sprawling chip fabrication plants, analysts at Bank of America (BAC) Global Research said in a note. They added that combining Qualcomm’s chip revenue of $33 billion with Intel’s $52 billion revenue would make Qualcomm the largest semiconductor company in the world. However, the analysts said regulatory and financial challenges from a potential deal would outweigh those benefits, and added they are skeptical of a proposed takeover, and believe confusion over the deal could end up benefitting Intel’s rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), and Arm. Here are three reasons Bank of America and other analysts say Qualcomm wouldn’t benefit much from an Intel takeover. A deal between a chip designer and a company with the factories to make those chips looks sensible from above, Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note — but it doesn’t actually “fit so well.” While Qualcomm uses British chip firm Arm’s architecture for its PC chips, Intel’s x86 processors, which are used in a lot of computer and server hardware, are designed differently. Bank of America analysts also noted the difference, saying Qualcomm’s “existing established relationships” on the Arm architecture make “it tougher to bring product” to Intel’s mostly x86-based fabs. Meanwhile, Windsor said Intel’s x86 processors are “under assault on all fronts from Arm and accelerated computing,” and that Qualcomm has already spent two decades competing against Intel’s chips in the mobile and PC market. “Consequently, it makes no sense to become the owner of a fading titan when one is in a good position to partially or completely displace it from the market,” Windsor said. And Qualcomm already has a relationship with other chipmakers such as TSMC (TSM) and Samsung, Windsor said, meaning it already knows “how to design its chips to be optimally manufactured on these processes.” Therefore, having to redesign its chips to be manufactured by Intel, which has already slipped behind with cutting edge chips, “sounds like a risky proposition to me,” he said. If Qualcomm does go through with an acquisition, it would come at a premium to Intel’s current expected value of $87 billion, Bank of America analysts said, adding that Intel also has about $53 billion in debt. Meanwhile, Qualcomm has $13 billion in cash on its balance sheet, analysts said. Intel is also planning to spend billions to support a growing fab network, including a five-year, $100 billion expansion plan for plants in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. While the chipmaker is expecting to receive almost $20 billion in direct federal funding and loans from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act to support the effort, it makes up a small portion of how much the expansion plan is expected to cost. Meanwhile, the chipmaker recently saw its shares close on a high after the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Commerce announced that it is eligible for a separate $3 billion in CHIPS Act funding under the Secure Enclave program. Windsor also said in his note that “Qualcomm would almost certainly pay for Intel with shares” which would lead to “dilution for existing holders of Qualcomm’s stock” (which includes Windsor). And while Intel’s shares have fallen this year, Windsor said it’s still “not cheap” due to the chipmaker’s falling revenue. Bank of America analysts said the potential deal faces a “tough regulatory environment, specifically in China,” where medium sized deals have, in the past, “taken years to even consider.” Therefore, analysts said, the potential to dominate the CPU market would actually work against a takeover, because it could face regulatory challenges. For example, the analysts noted Qualcomm’s failed acquisition of Dutch semiconductor company NXP (NXPI) in 2018, after it did not receive approval from China’s antitrust regulator.

Title: Nvidia Versus AMD: Which AI Stock Is The Better Buy Right Now?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/nvidia-vs-amd-which-ai-stock-better-buy-now/
Time Published: 2024-09-23T18:36:08Z

getty A year ago, there was only Nvidia (NVDA) in the AI race. But now investors are looking at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as a potential competitor. Which AI stock should have a place in your portfolio? Let's lay out the details so you can decide. Nvidia designs semiconductors for use in AI, gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 5G networks and data centers. While chip sales drive revenue, the company also supports a full platform of related offerings that developers use to create, deploy, run and scale enterprise applications on Nvidia's hardware. Nvidia established itself in the late 1990s by creating the graphics processing unit (GPU), primarily for use in gaming applications. In 2013, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saw a bigger picture for his company. He saw artificial intelligence as the future of computing—and believed Nvidia could lead that future. The company then began working on programmable GPUs to support complex computing operations. Today, Nvidia is the recognized leader in AI infrastructure, selling far more AI chips than any competitor. The chip designer also maintains a customer list that includes the best tech stocks in the world. AMD has historically battled with Intel for market share in central processing units (CPUs). Intel remains dominant, but AMD has been a formidable competitor—at least since CEO Lisa Su spearheaded the launch of the company's high-performance Zen architecture in 2017. Five years later, AMD's market capitalization passed Intel's for the first time. AMD is now targeting the AI market and Su has made some key moves to compete with Nvidia. She quadrupled the company's R&D budget and acquired Xilinx, Nod.ai and ZT Systems. Xilinx makes programmable processors, Nod.ai develops open-source AI software and ZT Systems' designs and manufactures servers and related infrastructure for data centers. AMD does not yet compete meaningfully with Nvidia. For the most recent quarter, AMD's data center revenues were less than 10% of Nvidia's. But as Intel struggles, AMD is positioning itself to secure a double-digit share in AI chips—which should be a sizable opportunity going forward. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Nvidia and AMD won't necessarily compete head-to-head for AI-related revenue. Let's look at their go-to-market strategies to understand why. Nvidia's original AI strategy was to be first and best. And the company has capitalized on this approach. Huang's strategic vision combined with a proven product development process provides some insulation from even the best AI stocks. As well, Nvidia doesn't just make AI chips. The company maintains an entire platform around those chips, including optimized software and libraries, to support application development from start to finish. This platform approach is another competitive advantage that could make customers reluctant to switch to another provider. AMD has played catch-up with Intel for years, and the company will likely use similar tactics to take a piece of the AI market from Nvidia. Providing better value is the crux of the strategy. AMD can do that by offering more performance for the price. That could mean similar performance at a lower price or slightly lower performance with a much smaller price tag. Providing and pitching a comprehensive AI computing platform has been a lesser focus for AMD. However, the company has taken steps to broaden its offering. The recent acquisition of ZT Systems, for example, enables AMD to deliver a full set of computing and storage resources required to power AI data centers. Nvidia's trailing 12-month revenues sum to about $96 billion, which is nearly four times more than AMD's $23 billion. The earnings comparison isn't quite as lopsided, with Nvidia delivering diluted EPS of $2.13 to AMD's $0.84. Both companies report AI-related revenues within their data center divisions. Nvidia's data center revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter was $26.3 billion, up 154% from the prior year. AMD produced data center revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115% year over year. The table below shows market capitalization, forward P/E ratio, price/book ratio, PEG and stock price upside for Nvidia and AMD. Table data sources: Yahoo Finance, Market Beat. As you can see, Nvidia is a much bigger enterprise. Its market cap of $2.89 trillion makes it the world's third-largest public company, ahead of Alphabet and Amazon. Nvidia's valuation metrics, particularly the price/book ratio, are also well higher than AMD's. However, the upside according to analyst price targets is comparable. You may also want to see what we think Nvidia will look like in five years. Nvidia has a dominant market share position plus a reputation as the AI chip leader. AMD is working to establish itself as a solid second option. Fortunately for AMD, the AI chip market is predicted to be large enough to be lucrative for two companies. Su has predicted global spending on AI accelerators to reach $400 billion by 2027. If AMD could capture 20% to 30% of that, the company's data center revenues could increase sevenfold. It's also likely that the tech companies investing in AI infrastructure will want more than one supplier and more than one software stack. AMD's development software, ROCm is an open-source solution, while Nvidia's CUDA is proprietary. CUDA has a strong reputation, but some projects may require the flexibility of AMD's open-source solution.

Multiple research companies and AMD's CEO have predicted strong double-digit annual growth for AI infrastructure spending over the next several years. The growth opportunity is somewhat different for our two companies, however. In short, Nvidia will be playing defense, while AMD plays offense. With a running start in the AI space, Nvidia now owns an estimated 80% market share. The quick rise to the top created extreme growth in revenues and profits, as tech companies rushed to build out their AI capabilities. Unfortunately for Nvidia, the spending may moderate just as competitors come to market with viable alternatives. Nvidia can find growth, however, by doing what it does best: pushing the limits of what high-performance computing can do in terms of speed and efficiency. Improving its platform to bring AI computing to a wider market could be another source of growth. The company won't be complacent under Huang's direction. Nvidia has recently shortened its product refresh cycle from two years to one year—presumably to keep pace with AMD's update cadence. AMD has more to gain and less to lose than Nvidia, which is the more interesting position to hold. AMD chips are currently cheaper and about 80% as powerful as Nvidia's according to AI software firm MosiacML. After testing AMD MI250 alongside Nvidia A100 last year, MosiacML CTO Hanlin Tang believes AMD can close the performance gap. That will be AMD's path to solid market share and revenue gains, especially if the company stays competitive on price and can produce enough to meet demand. Both companies will have to manage supply constraints, regulations that limit the revenue opportunity in China as well as rising competition. But they also face specific challenges related to where each stands in its AI growth trajectory. Nvidia's biggest challenge will be defending its position. The sheer size of the market ensures fierce competition as GPU makers position themselves for a piece of AI spending. To keep from losing market share, Nvidia will need to innovate and execute product rollouts flawlessly. Ongoing improvements in speed and efficiency will support higher spending even as the initial AI buildout slows. In the absence of impressive product upgrades, Nvidia could face share losses as spending moderates. That would be a revenue headwind, which likely won't sit well with Nvidia investors. AMD's primary challenge is establishing itself as the best second option in AI, while integrating four acquisitions made in the last two years. The acquisitions should support a more favorable competitive position, but it won't be enough to overtake Nvidia's dominance. So, the big risk for AMD is missing its target and ending up competing for the third or fourth position in the industry. Supply constraints or strategic, product or execution errors could open the door for another player like Intel to win market share. For more information, see Nvidia vs. Intel. Analysts are optimistic about Nvidia stock and AMD stock. Both companies have an average rating of strong buy. With 40 analysts reporting on Nvidia, there are 20 strong buys, 17 buys and three holds. No one is recommending investors sell their NVDA positions. The 30 ratings for AMD include 15 strong buys, 11 buys and four holds. As with NVDA, analysts don't see a case for selling AMD currently. To evaluate market sentiment, we can look at NVDA and AMD stock price trends relative to the broader market. NVDA has outperformed AMD and the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the last six months. Nvidia is up nearly 30%, the S&P 500 grew 10% and AMD has fallen 14%. Performance in the last month, however, shows Nvidia as the loser. The company lost 10%, while AMD and the S&P 500 made slight gains. This is partly a function of Nvidia's high valuation, which makes it more reactive to economic news. AMD is the better AI stock in terms of value and upside. Yes, the company is an underdog that's unlikely to replace Nvidia as the recognized AI leader. But, AMD has operated from second place before and thrived under its current leader Su. Plus, the addressable market is so large that a smaller share position still means massive growth for AMD. Nvidia already has a huge growth record going for it, but the company is quickly lapping the big AI-related gains it has generated to date. Comparisons will get harder from here on out and that could create more volatility for the NVDA stock price. Nvidia has the advantage of being the first to market a comprehensive solution set for AI computing. AMD has a smaller offering which it has been growing through internal product development and acquisitions. Nvidia is estimated to have 70% or more market share in AI chips. AMD's market share is probably closer to 10%. AMD is a safer bet than Nvidia stock as a long-term play, though both companies are poised for bright futures. AMD's valuations are more reasonable, and Nvidia may be closer to seeing its growth level off. Both companies provide high-performance, AI-capable processors and related products and services including software for application development. Nvidia's platform CUDA is proprietary, while AMD's ROCm is open source. Open-source applications are more flexible but can also be more cumbersome.

(“CrowdStrike” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: CRWD) and certain of its officers. Class Definition This lawsuit seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired CrowdStrike securities between November 29, 2023, and July 29, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: bgandg.com/CRWD. Case Details The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants repeatedly touted the efficacy of the Falcon platform while assuring investors that CrowdStrike’s technology was “validated, tested, and certified.” The Complaint alleges that these statements were false and misleading because Defendants had failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the Company’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period.

Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares lost ground Monday, a day before a Senate hearing on the costs of the company's popular weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen is scheduled to testify Tuesday from the company’s home in Denmark before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The committee accused the company of charging "outrageously high prices" for its treatments. The committee said Americans with Type 2 diabetes pay $969 a month for Ozempic, compared to $155 in Canada, $122 in Denmark, and $59 in Germany. It added that Americans are charged $1,349 a month for Wegovy, more than the $186 in Denmark, $140 in Germany, and $92 in the United Kingdom. In an interview with NBC News last month, Jorgensen defended the company’s pricing, saying that insurance coverage varies from country to country, and that most Americans with health insurance pay $25 a month for Wegovy. Novo Nordisk shares were down 3.3% at $123.55 in intraday trading Monday, extending Friday's losses after the company reported disappointing results from a study of an experimental weight-loss treatment. Still, they are up about 19% from the start of the year. TradingView

Title: Danish PM shrugs off risks of Ozempic maker’s economic dominance

Time Published: 2024-09-23T16:29:00Z

Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen downplayed concerns that Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO), the Scandinavian nation’s largest corporation, could someday drag down its economy the way the once-dominant Nokia (NOK) did to Finland in the 2000s. With a market value of $570 billion, Novo Nordisk has surpassed Denmark’s annual GDP. However, Frederiksen told Bloomberg on Monday that she didn’t see any risk associated with the size of Novo Nordisk. “I am extremely proud that we have big, now global, companies coming from Denmark. I don’t see a lot of risks with even the size of some of the companies, because we have a very strong economy also in other sectors,” Frederiksen said. “But we have of course to watch it.” Unrelenting demand for Novo Nordisk’s diabetes and weight loss drugs has made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe, surpassing luxury conglomerate LVMH last year. The Danish pharma giant helped boost the nation’s GDP in 2023 and is expected to do so again in 2024. The Nordic country’s largest bank, Danske Bank, forecast earlier this year that Denmark’s GDP will grow 2.1% in 2024, due primarily to Novo Nordisk. In 2023, Denmark’s GDP grew 1.8% — and much of its boost is owed to the pharmaceutical industry. Without pharmaceuticals, the agency says, the country’s GDP would have instead fallen 0.1%. Leading that growth is Novo Nordisk, with analysts expecting continued sales increases. Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate that the global market for GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic will reach $105 billion by 2030. The company reported in January that its 2023 sales jumped 31% to 232.3 billion Danish kroner ($33.8 billion), compared with 177 billion Danish kroner ($25 billion) in 2022. It also projects sales will increase by up to 22% to 28% in 2024. The situation is beginning to resemble Finland’s past reliance on Nokia, the once-dominant telecommunications company. According to estimates from the Finnish Economic Research Institute, Nokia accounted for 25% of Finland’s GDP growth between 1998 and 2007. But when rising competition from Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), and Samsung in the smartphone market led to Nokia’s rapid decline in the early 2010s, Finland faced significant economic challenges. This downturn, combined with the effects of the Great Recession, resulted in widespread job losses and ushered in over a decade of economic difficulties for the country. Addressing concerns that Denmark could face similar challenges with its reliance on Novo Nordisk, Frederiksen emphasized the country’s economic diversity. “A good thing is that our export portfolio is spread across several areas that are less sensitive to the business cycle than in other places,” she said. Denmark is also home to other major companies like Carlsberg, AP Moller-Maersk (AMKBY), Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY), and Lego.

Title: Qualcomm has good reasons to bid for Intel — but a takeover probably won't happen

If Qualcomm sees it through, its takeover of Intel would likely be the biggest in Silicon Valley history. While it has good reasons to go after the storied chip giant, a lot is working against it. The possibility of Intel handing its 56-year history over to a younger rival emerged last week after several reports said that the California semiconductor firm Qualcomm had approached it for a takeover. Qualcomm is no newbie in Silicon Valley. It was founded in 1985, 39 years ago. Since then, it has grown into a company worth over $188 billion, specializing in areas such as wireless networks, smartphone processors, and modems. But recent trouble brewing at Intel, a longtime chip designer and manufacturer, has apparently given Qualcomm reason to consider acquiring a company that has lost more than half its value this year and dropped to a market capitalization of just over $93 billion. While some of its top competitors, like Nvidia, have soared to new heights as a result of the generative-AI boom, Intel has struggled to capitalize on investor interest in the technology. It has also grappled with production and strategy challenges. The company took a serious tumble in August — a month in which it lost almost $30 billion in market value — after announcing the layoffs of 15,000 employees and a suspension of its dividend from the fourth quarter of this year. It's worth noting that Qualcomm's talks to take over this troubled business are very early stage and exploratory. A person close to Qualcomm told the Financial Times that the company "would only pursue a friendly deal." For some, the logic to pursue the deal is apparent. Speaking on CNBC last week, Patrick Moorhead, an industry analyst, said Intel's exposure to key areas like data centers and the PC market, as well as its chip-manufacturing capabilities — which Qualcomm lacks as it outsources that process to Taiwan's TSMC — meant there were "synergies in this." The company has also taken steps that seem to make it a more attractive purchase. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced a set of drastic measures last week to bring change to the company that could set it on a brighter path. He said these included a "multi-year, multi-billion-dollar" deal to work on custom chip designs with the tech heavyweight Amazon Web Services, a pause on plans to build plants in Europe, and the separation of its manufacturing unit, Intel Foundry, into its own entity. That said, not everyone is convinced that Qualcomm needs Intel — or that a buyout would be a good idea for either company. Richard Windsor, an equity-research analyst and the founder of Radio Free Mobile, thinks that while "it is possible to see how Qualcomm and Intel could fit together" — one company designs chips and the other has factories — a lot of Intel's bits wouldn't fit so well. "The vultures are hovering around Intel and while Intel will make a tasty and nutritious meal for some, I think Intel would end up sticking in Qualcomm's crop and give it a bad case of indigestion," he wrote in a note on Monday. He points to a few key reasons. Intel's x86 processors lag behind Qualcomm's and its rival firm Arm's offerings. Redesigning chips to be made by Intel "sounds like a risky proposition," he said, given Qualcomm's "already established excellent relationships" with manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ming-Chi Kuo, a Taiwan market analyst at the financial-services firm TF International Securities, went a step further, saying in a post over the weekend that a takeover of Intel could be "disastrous" for Qualcomm. My industry survey also indicates that Qualcomm is currently in takeover talks with Intel. However, if this acquisition were to go through, it could prove disastrous for Qualcommhttps://t.co/fJ7EozISve His rationale was that Qualcomm's "most critical focus should be on establishing competitiveness in AI chips" for segments like smartphones and that he didn't see an acquisition of Intel helping. It could boost its position in the market for artificial-intelligence PCs, but the analyst said he thought Qualcomm already had a strong standing in that area, with its processors used in Microsoft's Windows on Arm platform — a version of Windows running on Arm technology that Microsoft is committed to. "While the acquisition of Intel could rapidly increase Qualcomm's PC market share, it comes at a significant cost," he wrote. "Qualcomm can grow in the AI PC market even without the acquisition." It's also unclear how Qualcomm would find the cash to buy Intel. The company's cash on hand is $13 billion, but even with its free cash flow, it still falls far short of Intel's price. And the impact on competition would likely spark alarm among regulators. A Qualcomm bid for Intel could face similar regulatory obstacles to Nvidia's takeover attempt for Arm in 2020, which it abandoned in 2022. Intel will, of course, want to consider its options. Bloomberg reported on Sunday that a new option was on the table after the investment giant Apollo offered to make a "multibillion-dollar investment" in the company. That could offer the chip firm vital capital for its new plans and help it stand on its own two feet. Jump to

Alaska Airlines (ALK) said an IT issue was behind an issue with its system that caused flights to be delayed and a ground stop to be issued in Seattle Sunday night. The airline said the issue was resolved around 1 a.m. ET Monday, and told users flight operations and the airline's website should be back to normal. A total of 249 flights from Alaska Airlines were delayed Sunday, about 30% of their total schedule, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. "Last night, we experienced an IT issue that caused significant disruption to our operation—including delayed flights," the airline said in a statement. "The issue has been resolved, but we expect residual impacts to our operation. We sincerely apologize to our guests who are impacted and are working to get all our guests to their destinations." The company also told Reuters that the incident was not the result of a hack or any malicious activity. Earlier this month, the airline lifted its revenue and profit projections for the current quarter, in part thanks to the struggles of competing airlines during this summer's CrowdStrike (CRWD) outage that delayed or canceled thousands of flights. Alaska Air Group shares were up 2.5% to $41 in early trading Monday and have gained close to 5% since the start of the year.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Samsung Electronics reportedly have been considering building large new chip-making factories in the United Arab Emirates amid surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing. According to The Wall Street Journal, the projects being discussed "involve complexes that could contain numerous factories and cost over $100 billion in aggregate," but "government officials and industry executives say substantial technical and political hurdles remain." Among the hurdles on the technical side: The need for "super-clean water" to rinse silicon wafers—an issue when most of the UAE's water is produced via desalination—and "concerns about the availability of engineering talent to staff major new factories far from the companies' home bases." The report also said that the two companies have had talks with U.S. officials worried that the advanced AI chips produced would make their way to China, a key trading partner of the UAE. Government subsidies globally have been helping the chip industry expand in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. In the U.S., the government has been doling out billions in grants as part of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 to ensure production is done domestically. TSMC's American depositary receipts (ADRs), which edged higher as markets opened Monday, are up almost 70% this year.

Title: What Is The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Really?

Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg You probably hear about the Dow Jones Industrial Average every day, but how much do you really know about it? Q. What is the Dow Jones Industrial Average anyway? A. It’s a venerable U.S. stock-market index, that Charles Dow invented in 1896. It comprises 30 stocks, which the selection committee at Dow Jones & Co. (now part of News Corp.) considers to be leaders in their industries. Q. Was it always 30 stocks? A. When Charles Dow invented the index, it contained only 12 stocks. Some of the original stocks were American Cotton Oil Co., American Sugar Refining Co., Chicago Gas Co., National Lead Co. and United States Leather Co. Many of the original 12 merged into other companies and none of them are still in the index. Q. Are the stocks equal-weighted in the index? A. Not at all. They are weighted according to each stock’s price. That’s because the index was created before there were computers. Charles Dow added up the 12 prices and divided by 12. As a result of this quaint weighting system, Goldman Sachs (GS), with a stock price of $498.93 as of September 21, has about ten times the weight of Verizon (VZ), with a stock price of $44.33. Unscientific? You bet. Most modern stocks indices, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500, are weighted according to each stock’s market value. Q. Then why do people still pay attention to the Dow industrials? A. Professionals mostly use the S&P 500. But the Dow carries an aura of familiarity, history and tradition. Also, it’s nice to be able to research stocks (even if in a crude fashion) before 1923 when Standard & Poor’s started to publish an index. Q. What’s the highest weighted stock in the Dow? A. At the moment, it is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), with a stock price of $575, giving it an 8.9% weight in the average. Q. What’s the most lightly weighted stock? A. Intel Corp. (INTC), priced at $21.84, for a 0.34% weight. Q. What’s your favorite stock among the 30? A. I think highly of JPMorgan Chase and Co. (JPM). The nation’s largest bank, headed by the capable and charismatic Jamie Dimon, should benefit as the Federal Reserve cuts short-term interest rates. Q. What’s your least favorite? A. Probably Boeing Co. (BA). The strike by its machinists will get resolved, but I’m more worried about the long-term fallout from the company’s recent safety failures (most notably, a fuselage panel falling off in flight). To shore up quality and prevent future accidents, I believe Boeing will have to slow production. It will also be burdened with more federal regulatory oversight. Q. Is the word “industrial” in the index’s title misleading? A. A bit. For Dow index purposes, if a stock isn’t a utility or transportation stock, it’s an industrial. Q. What is Dow Theory? A. The theory postulates that a market advance is sustainable if, and only if, the Dow Jones transportation average (which Charles Dow invented in 1884) “confirms” a rise in the Dow Industrials. I’m a bit skeptical of the theory. Services are now a big part of the economy, reducing the importance of transportation. Q. How often do the components of the industrial average change? A. In 130 years, the Dow Jones selection committee has changed the components of the average 58 times. In most cases, more than one stock was replaced. Thus, the average has 30 current members and (if my count is correct) 111 former members. Q. What are the most recent changes? A. This year, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) was added and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) was dropped. In 2020, the selection committee added Amgen Inc. (AMGN), Honeywell International Inc. (HON) and Salesforce Inc. (CRM) to the average, eliminating Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Raytheon Technologies Corp. (RTX). Q. Do stocks dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average usually flop? A. Not at all. In fact, during the past 25 years, stocks kicked out of the average has outperformed their replacements. General Electric Co., which was one of the index’s original members, has revived its fortunes (and split into three successor companies) since it was booted in June 2018. GE was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, which has fallen 84% in the past five years and was itself kicked out in February 2024. Disclosure: Personally and for clients, I own shares in Pfizer. Some of my clients own Exxon Mobil, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. A hedge fund I run has call options on Intel, RTX and Walgreens, and put options on Boeing. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: What's Happening With FMC Stock?

UKRAINE - 2021/05/31: In this photo illustration the FMC Corporation (Food Machinery and Chemical ... [+] Corporation) logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) FMC Corporation stock (NYSE: FMC), an agricultural science company focused on products to improve crop yield and quality, currently trades around $64 per share, roughly 51% below its pre-inflation shock highs of around $131 seen in April 2022. FMC has fared much worse than its peer – CF Industries stock (NYSE: CF) – down 10% over this period. FMC stock has been weighed down after falling sales volume and destocking dampened its financial performance over the last year or so. Its business in Latin America also took a massive hit, with sales down 33% y-o-y in 2023. FMC saw its stock trading at around $101 in June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and it’s still trading 36% below those levels. This compares with 51% gains for the S&P 500 index over this period. The decrease in FMC stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could FMC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a recovery? Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $130 implies that FMC stock will have to gain around 2x from here, and we don’t think that will materialize anytime soon. We do think FMC stock has a some room for growth. It currently trades at 2x trailing revenues, compared to its average P/S ratio of 2.3x seen over the last three years. Notably, the $72 average of analysts price estimate reflects around 12% upside from here. Our detailed analysis of FMC Corporation’s upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company’s stock during the turbulent market conditions seen since 2022. It compares these trends to the stock’s performance during the 2008 recession. 2022 Inflation Shock Timeline of Inflation Shock So Far: In contrast, here’s how FMC stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis. Timeline of 2007-08 Crisis FMC and S&P 500 Performance During 2007-08 Crisis FMC stock declined 20% from nearly $18 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak for the markets) to $14 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out). It bounced after the 2008 crisis to levels of around $20 in early 2010, rising nearly 40% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124. FMC’s Fundamentals Over Recent Years FMC Corporation’s revenue declined from $5.0 billion in 2021 to $4.1 billion in the last twelve months. This can be attributed to lower sales volumes amid destocking of its products. A drought in Brazil last year also weighed on its sales. Not only did the company see its sales decline, its operating margin contracted from 22.5% in 2021 to 13.9% now. However, there has been some recovery this year. The company’s Q2 sales were up 4% -y-o-y on an organic basis. The North America region led this growth with sales rising 24% y-o-y. Its adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share were up 26% y-o-y. Looking forward, FMC expects its revenue to be in the range of $4.30 billion to $4.50 billion in 2024, reflecting a 2% decline at the midpoint versus 2023. It expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.02 to $3.64 per share, reflecting a decline of 12% at the midpoint versus 2023. Does FMC Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock? FMC’s total debt increased from $3.3 billion in 2021 to $4.2 billion now, while its cash decreased from $517 million to $472 million over this period. The company also garnered $481 million in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. Given that FMC’s market capitalization is $8 billion, a debt level of $4 billion implies a high debt to equity ratio of around 50%. Its cash as a percentage of assets of under 4% is low. This implies that the company’s financial position isn’t great. Conclusion With the Fed’s efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiments, we believe FMC Corporation stock has the potential for some gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, the pressure on the company’s sales volume and a large debt obligation, remains a significant risk factor to realizing these gains.

Intel (INTC) shares are surging in premarket trading as Apollo Global Management reportedly mulls an investment, days after another report of a Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover approach; Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Dell Technologies (DELL) become members of the S&P 500 today; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Samsung Electronics reportedly have been considering building UAE chip megafactories; AstraZeneca (AZN) shares are falling as its breast cancer drug misses its target; and China's sudden call for a press briefing tomorrow is raising expectations of a massive stimulus plan by regulators. U.S. stock futures are edging higher after the Federal Reserve's jumbo-sized interest-rate cut last week. Here's what investors need to know today. Intel (INTC) shares are jumping 4% in premarket trading after Bloomberg reported on Sunday that asset manager Apollo Global Management has offered to invest as much as $5 billion in the struggling chipmaker. The news came after The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday afternoon that Qualcomm (QCOM) has approached Intel about a potential acquisition. Intel shares have lost more than half their value this year. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) stock is slipping 1% and Dell Technologies (DELL) is edging lower in premarket trading as the two companies join insurer Erie Indemnity (ERIE) in becoming members of the S&P 500 today. However, the data-analytics firm and the PC maker have both seen their shares gain in the runup to today's benchmark index entry. The companies will be replacing American Airlines Group (AAL), Etsy (ETSY), and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO). Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Samsung Electronics reportedly have been considering building large new factories in the United Arab Emirates to meet surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing. According to The Wall Street Journal, the projects being discussed "involve complexes that could contain numerous factories and cost over $100 billion in aggregate," but "government officials and industry executives say substantial technical and political hurdles remain." AstraZeneca's (AZN) American depositary receipts (ADRs) are falling about 2% after the pharma giant said its experimental cancer drug datopotamab deruxtecan, jointly developed with Japan's Daiichi Sankyo, failed to meet goals in a Phase 3 breast cancer trial. The news comes just weeks after the Anglo-Swedish firm said a late-stage trial of the same drug didn't significantly improve patients' overall lung cancer survival rates. China announced plans for an ad-hoc press briefing tomorrow on the economy by its financial regulators, including its top central banker—fueling investor hopes that Beijing is planning to issue large stimulus measures to boost the hard-hit economy. Bloomberg reported that some economists are expecting the regulators to cut policy rates or the amount banks need to set aside as reserves, and also measures to support the country's troubled housing market. The People's Bank of China also lowered its 14-day reverse repurchase rate Monday.

Title: Oracle's Stock is Red Hot. So Why Is Wall Street Divided?

Could Oracle (ORCL) be this year’s next big AI-fueled hypergrowth story? It's already had a blockbuster 2024. After a recent runup powered by an upbeat AI-fueled outlook, the database giant has become the second best-performing tech stock in the S&P 500 of the year—trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). The surge has thrilled shareholders and enriched founder Larry Ellison, who is in a nip-and-tuck race with Amazon's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos to be the world’s second-richest person. But while some hot stocks get the full backing of Wall Street, analysts are divided about what's next for Oracle. The mean price target on Oracle's shares is currently $174.67, according to Visible Alpha, only a modest 4% above Friday's close. Oracle, with a client base that includes Fortune 500 companies as well as governments, remains one of the world’s leading database enterprise companies, though it faces rising competition from newer rivals in an increasingly cloud-centric environment. And there is plenty of support for Oracle out there, with more than half of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha currently sporting "buy" ratings on the shares. Jefferies analysts said they believe Oracle could be "getting its mojo back” after attending the company’s recent CloudWorld event, where the tech stalwart said it expects sales to nearly double in the next five years on AI-driven demand for cloud services. Bernstein called Oracle their “top investment idea” after the event, citing Oracle’s cloud services growth, AI vision, and the shift of its flagship database business to the cloud, writing that “the sun shines in the Oracle Cloud.” Recent agreements with Big Three cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, as well as its "AI-first cloud architecture" could also play a role in helping Oracle support growth, according to Melius analysts, who see those partnerships as a signal that those companies "need to work with Oracle to keep driving their own Cloud segment growth to please investors." Bernstein analysts said the partnerships could also give Oracle opportunities to introduce its services to new customers, as well as sell existing customers on a wider range of offerings. “Now that the train has left the station, we believe investors will continue to reward Oracle for faster revenue growth,” Melius analysts wrote. Some analysts, however, expressed skepticism about Oracle's ability to deliver on its new growth targets and suggested they could leave the company little room for error. At Oracle's annual briefing for financial analysts, the company said it expects its revenue will rise to at least $104 billion by fiscal 2029, nearly doubling the $53 billion Oracle reported in June for fiscal 2024. The company also raised its sales projection for fiscal 2026 to at least $66 billion, up from an earlier $65 billion. Both of those figures were well ahead of the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts called the new targets "aggressive" and said Oracle could be “reaching for the sky" with its projections. "It's hard for us to underwrite," they wrote. "We're comfortable on the sidelines.”

Title: Twin Insurgency, Irregular War, and Oil Theft in Nigeria and Brazil: An Overview

Twin Insurgency, Irregular War, and Oil Theft in Nigeria and Brazil: An Overview Zachary Z. Horsington This article reviews the concept of twin insurgency and its constituent components of criminal insurgency and plutocratic insurgency in order to illuminate case studies of oil theft in Nigeria and Brazil. Gilman’s concept of twin insurgency represents a fusion of Sullivan’s concept of criminal insurgency, and Bunker’s concept of plutocratic insurgency.[1] Mutually, these concepts are essential to perceiving the threat environment associated with Nigerian and Brazilian oil theft, as both cases feature blurred criminality and politics conducted by a range of networked twin insurgent threat actors and their accomplices. As such, Gilman, Sullivan, and Bunker’s concepts concerning the criminal-plutocratic insurgent nexus will be examined, as well as a number of other corresponding irregular warfare theories, before the Nigerian and Brazilian oil theft case studies are investigated in detail. Crude Oil Barrells, Niger Delta, Stakeholder Democracy, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Twin Insurgency Sullivan’s theory of criminal insurgency describes a threat spectrum of criminal evolution between first generation ‘turf’ gangs, and third generation insurgent criminals, differentiated by their politicization, internationalization, and sophistication.[2] First generation gangs are highly territorial, localized, and limited in political scope, though they nonetheless “undermine the ability of the state to perform its legitimizing security and public service functions” through their low-level unlawfulness.[3] They are typically confined to neighborhoods, where their activities are not highly sophisticated, as compared to subsequent generations.[4] Second generation criminal organizations, on the other hand, attempt to coopt “bureaucrats and elected officials of a targeted political or security entity,” for profit motivated reasons.[5] “They may embrace a broader political agenda (albeit market focused), operate in a broader (sometimes multi-state) context, and conduct more sophisticated operations,” as they typically leverage emerging net-warrior capabilities.[6] As compared to first generation gangs, there is more expanded territorial and international reach, more complex internal self-organization, more diversified criminal activity, and typically an increase in violence and/or threats of violence against non-aligned individuals.[7] Finally, third generation entities seek exclusive zones of autonomy, to “de facto (in fact, whether legally or not) transform [themselves] into states-within-a-state,” which are able to leverage “authoritative allocation of values [and resources] in that social or physical terrain”.[8] Thus, “third generation gangs are mercenary/political gangs able to exert a combination of market and political influence to control territory”.[9] Their “evolved political and economic aims” contest, if necessary “the state monopoly of violence in a particular geographic space,” exploiting warlordism, “corruption, privatization of public goods and relativism of all kinds”.[10] Sophisticated criminal insurgents may also leverage near full-spectrum, all-domain capabilities to support their activities when required.[11] Gilman argues criminal insurgents are often fashioned from “the global disenfranchised,” and concurs with Sullivan that they espouse micro-sovereignties beyond mere profit motivation.[12] Such entities “resist, coopt, and route around states as they seek ways to empower and enrich themselves in the shadows of the global economy”.[13] Simultaneously they “deploy their resources to corrupt, coopt, or challenge incumbent political actors,” although the distinction between criminal and political violence is certainly blurred.[14] Conversely, Bunker describes plutocratic insurgents as “high net worth globalized elites,” who seek to insulate themselves from “public spaces and obligations—including taxation—and to maximize their ability to generate profits transnationally”.[15] Through predatory capitalism, corruption, public looting, the privatization of public spaces, stateless tax avoidance, and lobbied tax cuts, plutocratic insurgents evade both the law and accountability in luxurious techno-palaces.[16] Often in consort with criminal insurgents, such threat actors also seek to consolidate favorable transnational micro-sovereign enclaves.[17] Gilman observes that transnational plutocrats increasingly disassociate their personal accomplishments “from the success of the national societies in which they reside”.[18] While some individuals continue to perceive a “debt of obligation to the societies in which they have enriched themselves,” this is a scant and shrinking minority.[19] This has resulted in self-reinforcing positive feedback loops whereby: “plutocratic insurgents increasingly see no reason to contribute anything to their host societies and, indeed, actively contest the idea that citizenship comes with economic responsibilities”.[20] Thus, many are highly open to engaging in corruption, as they see no reflective value or responsibility in influencing efficacious and equitable state functions. Criminal and plutocratic insurgents “thrive in (and indeed try to foster) weak-state environments,” while at the same time their operations reinforce conditions of weakness.[21] They may migrate and attempt to reshape their environment to exclude competitors and insulate themselves from legal and public accountability. Plutocrats have insurgent potential to exploit transnational systems and local grievances overseas to expand their operations. The intersection, overlap, and symbiosis between criminal and plutocratic insurgency is a polycephaly Gilman describes through the concept of “twin insurgency”.[22] Both insurgents frequently cooperate and compete with each other to carve out de facto micro-sovereignties and zones of autonomy by disemboweling and decimating anyone’s capacities to constrain their activities. The final landscape consists of “diverse enclaves of heterogeneous political authority and of non-standardized social-service provisioning arrangements”.[23] As these non-standard arrangements materialize, “national and local authorities proliferate a variety of increasingly one-off exceptions to the general rules, incrementally traducing the liberal notion of equality before the law”.[24] The subsequent “proliferation of exceptional and unique micro sovereignties” enables further “jurisdictional arbitrage,” and non-state demands for “sovereign exceptions”.[25] The twin insurgency may also privately run select services and security traditionally provided by the state, and the civilians who live in these pseudo/semi-autonomous sectors of insurgent control “increasingly recognize the insurgents rather than the hollowed-out state as the real source of local power and authority”.[26] Ucko and Marks argue there may be merit in applying irregular warfare/counterinsurgency approaches to respond to sophisticated organized crime.[27] “The point is not to militarize further the response to organized crime. Instead, counterinsurgency in its theory is a political activity. Its contribution to consideration of organized crime is to cast the phenomenon as fueled by specific political and social drivers which must, alongside the criminal actors, also be addressed”.[28] While Ucko and Marks do not explicitly delineate the threshold whereby a criminal threat actor should be responded to with irregular war/fare approaches beyond traditional law enforcement, Sullivan, Bunker and Gilman’s arguments regarding criminal sovereignty interests transcending greed befittingly provide more clarity on this.[29] This demands the population be considered the center of gravity regarding warfare aspects, and sovereign dysfunction concerning the war itself.[30] Nonetheless, Ucko and Marks highlight how traditional organized crime responses have a “tendency to view the state unquestioningly as a provider, and its enemies as the threat,” which ignores “the very heart of the problem: a lack of government legitimacy and split loyalties among the population”.[31] They emphasize how legitimacy is not static, and instead “subjective, fluid, contextual, and contested; nothing can be taken for granted”.[32] Thus, “the state cannot in any way assume to hold legitimacy merely because it is duly constituted or has legal status”.[33] Ucko and Marks argue that political elites oftentimes are “more interested in retaining power and privilege than addressing the reasons for strife” when tackling irregular war/fare threats.[34] They note tendencies “to militarize even ‘whole-of-government’ endeavors,” and resource allocations in favor of kinetic operations in such situations, both of which realize actions disconnected from any “viable political process that gives military activity strategic meaning”.[35] Legitimacy can be shaped through coercion, although “sustaining cooperation is made easier if co-option also plays a role. Either way, gaining legitimacy means more than emotive affinity; it also involves a self-interested calculation that such loyalty is likely to pay off”.[36] Their arguments reflect “the artificiality of the state in many insurgency-threatened contexts,” and highlight how “in such contexts, the attempted imposition of the state can be deeply counterproductive”.[37] Ucko and Marks advise instead interfacing with “local structures that regulate life away from the state, so that they may be co-opted to benefit both center and periphery within the context of a loosely unified national compact,” as these “local institutions are often seen as more legitimate by the local population”.[38] Ucko and Marks champion “the state underwriting and empowering informal variations on the periphery, thereby satisfying local needs, empowering local political allies, and contributing to a desire to be part of, rather than resist, the state at the heart of it all”.[39] This is – of course – easier to write than realize. However, their arguments provide nuance in perceiving organized crime as “not an extension of a foreign body to the existing system, country or infrastructure,” but instead as a “product of a country’s history, its social conditions, its economic system, its political elite and its law enforcement regime”.[40] They remark that “this is not an invitation to moral relativism”.[41] Instead, their arguments offer a kaleidoscope to consider “why social contracts and political settlements are fueling organized crime,” in order to better “distinguish between crime as a coping mechanism and crime as exploitation,” while – of course – scrutinizing “the state’s role in enabling either”.[42] Doing so may enable better differentiation “between foot-soldiers, who in dysfunctional conditions can readily be replaced, and the organizers of criminal activity, who are more inaccessible and may even enjoy some level of state protection”.[43] Hackett argues that sovereignty defines irregular war.[44] While the population may be considered the center of gravity regarding the warfare, the dynamic construct of sovereignty should be considered the center of gravity for the war itself.[45] Previous discussions surrounding the motivations behind Irregular Warfare are highly dichotomous: there is ‘our’ political will and ‘theirs’.[46] Thus, Hackett’s arguments go beyond and consider dis/functional sovereignty as publicly dynamic and intersocial.[47] Hackett defines irregular war as: “the apotheosis of conflict between the people and the state, a violent dialectic between a faction and a sovereign expressed outside existing political institutions”.[48] He argues that the “intervening factor is sovereign dysfunction, and its presence in the conflict leads to irregular wars in which insurgents, conventional forces, and ­third-party interventions seek to preserve, destroy, or transform the state through organized political violence”.[49] Hackett describes sovereign dysfunction as “the disconnect between a state’s de jure (legally recognized) structure and its de facto behaviour, especially in the liminal space between what the people demand, what the state promises, and what is delivered”.[50] Counterinsurgency understands that there is no military solution, but instead a “military component to a larger strategy that is framed in political ends, flanked by all instruments of national power, working in concert through the direction of a single, unified leadership and grand strategy”.[51] While this seems a basic understanding, Hackett observes throughout the Cold War and the Global War on Terror that thought, practice, and disconnection expose enduring institutional gaps associated with reconciling and interfacing ‘sovereignty’ and public opinion to extinguish irregular threat actors.[52] It is how McChrystal’s Task Force 714 were able to defeat al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) highly efficiently, but could not comprehend the genesis of Islamic State.[53] It is why Afghanistan is governed by the Taliban again today, and how Islamic State and al-Qaeda continue to gain territory across Africa and Asia. This discussion related to sovereignty and irregular war is all the more significant considering climate change and the climate-conflict nexus.[54] Schmidt’s concept of Discursive Institutionalism is particularly relevant here, as is Däniker’s concept of The Guardian Solider.[55] If state security apparatuses seriously want to better understand Irregular War/fare, in identifying the population and sovereignty as its center of gravity, they must function as more dynamic, socially discursive institutions. Lythgoe (2020) argues against hyper-decentralized command: it is not so much how centralized or decentralized your system is, but how dynamic it is in fluidly interpreting the right state, at the right time, for the right context.[56] The same elasticity is required to inform dialogic interactions in the public domain. However, this is all highly counterintuitive for state security apparatuses, which typically consider secrecy/transparency as binary, see public exposure negatively, and seek minimal partnership.[57] It is understood that the Information Revolution has transformed state/non-state capacities into self-organized, leveraged instruments of power in novel, efficient ways. The fields of Netwar and Chaoplexic Warfare examine this potential.[58] General Stanley McChrystal’s concepts of a ‘Team of Teams’ and F3EAD (i.e., find, fix, finish, exploit, analyze, disseminate) represent applications of these ideas at the most sophisticated and classified level.[59] These theories accentuate complex adaptivity and decentralized operations, although they do not explain how the system should best treat independent feedback in the public domain and public partnership. Indeed, a critical short-coming concerning Information Operations (IO) identified by Lieutenant Colonel Norman E. Emery, of the US Army, is that it “neglects a key target of irregular warfare: the relevant population not categorized as adversarial”.[60] Security apparatus-public affairs currently function as a one-way street: operations are coordinated through public channels to either support ‘friendly’ forces or disadvantage ‘adversary’.[61] It is clear that the global threat environment has changed dramatically in the last 25 years. While many of the components of twin insurgency have existed long before Gilman, Sullivan and Bunker, their nexus, hybridization, and capacities today manifest in novel ways that challenge current institutional understanding, jurisdiction, and best practice.[62] As highlighted by Ucko and Marks and Hackett, institutional gaps concerning these threats are not unique to the past or any one nation: more clarity is needed and more discursive methods need to be tested.[63] All these theories are highly relevant to consider when examining Nigerian and Brazilian oil theft, as state responses have been, and continue to largely be, highly securitized/militarized. Nigeria functions as a mono-economy, depending on oil for over 95% of its export revenue, 6-9% of its GDP, and 70% of its total budget expenditure.[64] More than 90% of its oil production occurs in the Niger Delta Region and offshore.[65] The magnitude of oil theft in Nigeria is astronomical. Between 2009-2020, the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) found that 619.7m barrels of crude were lost due to theft and sabotage, valued at ₦16.25t (USD46.16b).[66] Security, repairs, and maintenance of damaged assets cost the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) ₦136b (USD91.48m) in 2023.[67] This is slightly less than the ₦147b (USD98.88m) they spent in 2022.[68] Unprecedented revenue losses were observed between 2019-2022 (USD2.1b, USD1.9b, USD7.2b and USD22.4b respectively).[69] In 2022, losses to theft were upwards of 700,000 barrels per day (bpd).[70] In 2023, National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu cited loses of 400,000bpd to thieves.[71] Losses for this year are estimated at 470,000bpd, although many speculate the figures are much higher.[72] This equates to roughly USD700m lost to theft and vandalism each month.[73] In January 2023, Nigeria’s national oil production rate was 1.4m bpd (condensate and crude) [74] – 1.5m bpd was reported in February, falling to 1.2m bpd in March.[75] For the same three-month period this year (2024), the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) reported: 1.6m bpd, 1.5m bpd, and 1.4m bpd respectively (condensate and crude).[76] However, separating crude from condensate reveals: 1.32m bpd in February, 1.23m bpd in March, and 1.28m bpd in April.[77] While the situation may be slightly improving, Nigeria is nonetheless tight-rope walking its OPEC quota of 1.5m barrels per day, and clearly relying on condensate to veneer its production.[78] The state of Nigeria’s oil facilities is also dire. The Federal Government owns four refineries, although none are currently operational.[79] Two may be online by the end of this year.[80] Likewise, out of 57 Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPL) displayed by the NUPRC, about 33 are non-producing oil blocs.[81] Government security efforts offshore have been successful, although they have arguably displaced and entrenched threats onshore. The International Maritime Bureau indicates a decline in offshore criminality within the Gulf of Guinea since 2021.[82] Nigeria accounted for 17% of reported incidents in 2021, compared to 42% in 2020.[83] While no incidents were reported offshore in 2022, onshore oil theft that year was the worst Nigeria has ever experienced. Indeed, most incidents offshore in 2021 occurred in anchorages, ports and harbors, which should have signaled signs of threat displacement.[84] Considering Nigeria’s oil is produced mainly in the Niger Delta, it is here where the majority of oil theft occurs. The displacement of the pirates closer to the coastline and back ashore since 2022 has only magnified onshore oil theft and the diversity of threat actors involved. The graph below shows NNPC reported weekly cases of theft for the first few months of 2024.[85] Igbintade finds monthly case numbers oscillate around 1,337.[86] Udi (2024) finds the majority of reported theft cases occur in the Central and Eastern regions of the Niger Delta, with less and less occurring offshore in deep water.[87] Figure 1: NNPC Weekly Reported Theft Cases [85] The situation is so bad that Shell recently decided to completely divest its onshore assets and exclusively operate offshore.[88] While the Federal Government recently announced that Shell, Total Energies, and Exxon Mobil have committed to invest USD13.5b over the next two years to increase Nigerian oil output overall, a number of significant challenges need to be overcome before any robust security can be realized.[89] The 1966 anti-Igbo pogrom contributed to the outbreak of Nigeria’s Civil War, although Biafra’s oil wealth and Federal Government opportunism should not be understated as causes as well.[90] As argued by Okwelum, “Biafra’s independence would certainly have cut the nation’s [potential] oil wealth production in half,” which they argue influenced the Federal Government to extinguish any chance at Biafra secessionism.[91] Niger Delta communities continue to experience ethnic disenfranchisement, external exploitation, and livelihood insecurity. Niger Delta underdevelopment and persistent pollution is not merely a product of local criminality and oil theft: persistent federal mismanagement, corruption, and greed define national resource allocation and economic activity.[92] It has been estimated that more than 80% of Nigeria’s oil and gas revenues benefit just 1% of the populous.[93] Simultaneously, 50% of Nigeria has been designated impoverished by the World Bank, and 40% of those under age 25 in the Niger Delta Region are unemployed.[94] The recent removal of government fuel subsidies has not helped to remedy the situation.[95] In 2007, Nigeria’s unemployment rate was 6%; in 2019, it was 30%.[96] More generally, the Nigerian Federal Government has not harmonized economic development and reinvestment into the country’s surging population.[97] Currently at 200m, Nigeria’s population is set to double by 2050.[98] Current policy and practice cannot accommodate such growth. Recent protests highlight how government disenfranchisement is fervent nationwide. Nigerian food inflation stands at 40%, and according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the country already has the highest number of food insecure people on the planet (31.8 million).[99] The naira (currency) has lost 70% of its value against the US dollar over the past two years, following two devaluations.[100] Petrol prices are rising sharply, and electricity droughts continue to plague large swaths of the population.[101] National food, economic, and power insecurity will continue to magnify instability across the Niger Delta, unless more substantive internal transformation occurs. As such, Niger Delta grievances are likely to persist and deepen. Animosity is also directed against foreign oil corporations, who are perceived to be a neo-colonial presence in-country. They have long been considered by many Nigerians to be dishonest, exploitative, and/or ethnically/religiously prejudiced. In 1993, Shell operations were affected by over 100 communal disturbances, which contributed to the loss of approximately 12m barrels of oil, worth around ₦369b (USD248m).[102] Shell’s recent decision to move exclusively offshore reveals the company’s reduced risk appetite, although the decision is perhaps also influenced by the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in favor of Shell regarding a USD878m oil spill case, which had previously halted the sale of its onshore assets.[103] Local apathy towards foreign oil conglomerates also stems from their reputation (whether warranted or not) for environmental degradation. Corporate community development initiatives have also been lackluster and at times outright counterproductive. They have willing called for harsh security responses against demonstrators, and have paid out millions to co-opt local chiefs.[104] The formal authority of chiefs is still not officially constitutionally defined, and is currently being reviewed.[105] Conflict has spiked before, and will continue to do so, until underlying dysfunctional sovereignty and the Niger Delta’s underdevelopment are addressed. Hundreds of oil facilities were vandalized between 1998-2003, and ethnic militias escalated between 2005-2010 to taking hostages, detonating cars, and attacking installations on-land and at-sea.[106] Losses in revenue related to direct attacks against Nigerian oil infrastructure cost the Federal Government USD6.8b between 1999-2004, and losses sharply increased again around 2006/7.[107] Bish et al. highlight that, while amnesty programs were introduced after the 2008 surge in Niger Delta violence, persistent low intensity conflict since 2012 indicates unaddressed and simmering grievances and tensions.[108] Indeed, the amnesty program itself has been scrutinized for its inconsistent Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) principles, lack of supplementary employment for many militants, sporadic salaries, discrimination, and generous stipends to select militant leadership.[109] The failure of demobilization and youth movements has further augmented the influence of cults, militia, and street gangs.[110] Thus, as argued by Okwelum, the disenfranchised communities of the Niger Delta region perceive oil theft to be a “display of local expertise and an entrepreneurial free market response to local economic dysfunction, chronic energy shortages, and government’s failure to deliver on basic public services,” rather than a criminal activity.[111] Historical legacy, underdevelopment, external exploitation and environmental devastation continue to fuel local resentments which transliterate into criminality, namely oil theft, in an attempt to alleviate “their impoverished condition”.[112] While many Nigerian Criminal Armed Groups (CAGs) espouse separatism or flaunt ethnic and religious sentiments, considering the dire economic situation in the Niger Delta, significant scrutiny is required to decipher and distinguish socio-political interests from financial motivations. Such distinction is necessary to discriminate criminal insurgents from organized criminals. While it is clear that dysfunctional sovereignty is apparent in the Niger Delta Region, clearer differentiation between these threat actors is necessary to better tailor state response. As argued by Okwelum: “The face of the jerry-can-wielding-rural-poor is not the face of oil theft.” Considering the flagrant and widespread corruption, “they are [merely] the foot soldiers paraded before the public as a decoy and deceit”.[113] As argued by Katsina, and Moliki, Nkwede, and Dauda, structural, socio-economic, and political imbalances predominantly fuel Nigeria’s national security threats.[114] Until such factors are adequately addressed, twin insurgency will continue to thrive in Nigeria. Nigerian oil theft is not technologically sophisticated. Basic hot and cold tapping and scooping practices are widespread. Tanker interdiction occurs in littoral waters, and so-called artisanal refineries are pervasive across the Niger Delta Region. A spokesperson for Tantita Security Services Nigeria Limited, a Nigerian private security company led by former militant leader Government Ekpemupolo (a.k.a. Tompolo), recently said that: “Most of the [stolen] oil is locally refined from the Niger Delta. A vessel can bring 10,000tons from Europe, take 60,000tons from Niger Delta, and falsify the documents, claiming it is from Europe”.[115] Trucks are also used to transport stolen oil to “neighboring Cameroon, Niger Republic, Chad and so on. Nigerian oil goes everywhere”.[116] Oil is stored in sacks for handling purposes and camouflage.[117] To pass through the abundance of road blocks in Nigeria, a single number plate will be legitimately registered for transit, and forgeries of the relevant documentation will be used by multiple trucks.[118] No sooner is one tap or distillery shutdown before multiple replacements appear, “in a few hours”.[119] Moreover, “you will find women and children inside the bush working and contributing their share to the oil theft”.[120] Thieves often install CCTV around their taps to provide early warning against security forces.[121] Threat actors have attacked oil facilities with light weapons and explosives; industry personnel have been kidnapped; and many are implicated in egregious inter-ethnic/religious/community human rights abuses. Coordinated industrial action has also occurred. Threat actors are typically armed with indigenously produced small arms, although looting government stores and smuggling have provided more sophisticated weapons. In 2021, The Organized Crime Index ranked Nigeria far higher than the West African average (8 vs 5.5).[122] The Eastern Security Network (ESN) and Boko Haram are both known to loot government stockpiles, and the Cameroonian border towards the Southeast is known to be assailable.[123] Simultaneously, Nigeria’s indigenous arms manufacturing industry is ever-expanding. Indigenously produced models are typically four times cheaper than imported pieces, and a rudimentary pistol can cost as little as ₦3,500 (USD2.4).[124] For perspective, Nigeria’s official minimum wage is ₦70,000 (USD43) per month, although it is likely to be much less in practice. In 2022, a Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons estimated that 60% of illegal arms in circulation in Southeast Nigeria are artisanal pieces.[125] Nigeria’s artisanal light arms production is now a fully-fledged local industry, which will significantly complicate future DDR. Irregular threat actor groups associated with oil theft typically operate as cellular networks rather than as hierarchies.[126] Nearly all threat groups are resilient to leadership decapitation as well, as they operate cells, frequently referred to as ‘houses’ or ‘decks’.[127] Most oil thieves do not associate themselves with a specific threat actor group. Group affiliation and overt marketing typically attracts government attention and fierce response. Thus, most oil thieves affiliate informally across ethnic, religious, and community lines. Groups may be temporarily formed or revived, and criminals may participate across multiple groups and localities. Despite the opaque threat environment a few notable groups may be differentiated as insurgent criminals. Other, purely profit-motivated groups exist too, as do other less publicized separatist movements involved in oil theft. Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB): A separatist group founded in 2012 that seeks to re-establish an independent Biafran state.[128] The group commands significant influence over Nigeria’s ethnic Igbo community and claims resource/land rights within Biafra’s historic borders (present-day Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Cross River, Ebonyi, Enugu, Rivers, Imo States, Nigeria).[129] Mazi Chika Edoziem (previously deputy) is its new leader, as Nnamdi Kanu (leader since 2013 and British citizen) is currently imprisoned by the Department of State Services (DSS).[130] The group’s spokesman is Emma Powerful. Dr. Fredrick Onyeali and Onyekachukwu Ezemba are the original founders of the current IPOB movement. The group operates the Eastern Security Network (ESN) and Black Marines as security forces. ESN is quite a sophisticated paramilitary entity, evidenced by a prison break in Imo State in 2021, which freed 1,800 IPOB inmates.[131] The group is still very active, and recently claimed the lives of six civilians and five soldiers in Aba.[132] The military responded by launching a raid which attempted to arrest those responsible, although six IPOB were killed in a firefight.[133] In April, 2021, IPOB formally allied itself with the Ambazonia Governing Council (AGovC) and the Ambazonia Defence Forces.[134] The alliance was denounced by the Interim Government of Ambazonia as well as by other Biafran separatist groups. Niger Delta Avengers (NDA): Openly seeks to cripple oil production.[135] Threatened ‘Operation Humble’ in June 2021, a campaign of violence against the NFG, as well as the destruction of oil installations, although no attacks were publicly attributed to them after this statement.[136] Field Commander Tu-ere, (AKA Queen of the Creeks) was assigned to lead the operation, who was previously involved in bombing the Chevron Valve offshore platform in May, 2016; the Shell Forcados 48-inch Export line in June, 2016; and the Exxon Mobil Qua Iboe 48 Crude Oil Pipeline in July, 2016. Known to operate in Ondo, Bayelsa, Edo, Delta, Imo, Abia and Akwa Ibom States, Nigeria.[137] In June last year, NDA spokesperson Mudoch Agbinibo called for: “The international community to come and support the restoration of our rights to peaceful self-determination… Since the amalgamation of Nigeria in 1914 to date, our resources have been used to sustain the political administrative livewire of Nigeria to the exclusion of the Niger Delta… We want our resources back to restore the essence of human life in our region for generations to come because Nigeria has failed to do that. The world should not wait until we go the Sudan way”.[138] Unyekisong Akwa Ibom (UAI): Comprises former members of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), the Niger Delta Volunteer Force, Movement for the Actualization of the Niger Delta Republic, Niger Delta People’s Salvation Force, Niger Delta Avengers, Niger Delta Liberation Force and Niger Delta Movement for Justice and Niger Delta Warrior.[139] Akwa Ibom indigenes argue militant amnesty programs have consistently discriminated against them.[140] UAI views government amnesty/peace initiatives in the Niger Delta as inherently discriminatory and enablers of corruption. The group seeks to secure oil facilities within their territory, and issued ultimatums to the Nigerian government in 2021 and 2022, although no action followed.[141] UAI is believed to still be led by General Dede Udofia and Major Ibanga Ekang. Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND): Despite the group having officially dissolved, it is understood that factions/ethno-religious groups previously under the umbrella of MEND continue to operate independently to this day. Other groups that have previously attacked/threatened oil operations which may be active or have members acting autonomously: Niger-Delta People’s Volunteer Force; Red Egbesu Water Lions; Joint Niger-Delta Liberation Force; Niger-Delta Red Squad; Niger-Delta Greenland Justice Mandate; Niger-Delta Youth Movement; Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People; Federated Niger-Delta Ijaw Communities; Niger-Delta Liberation Force; Niger-Delta Civil Society Coalition; Coalition of Niger-Delta Agitators; Bakassi Strike Force; Niger Delta Vigilante; the Icelanders; and the Outlaws.[142] This list is not exhaustive. Cult groups are also influential, leveraging “whole communities, churches, schools- universities, secondary schools and even primary schools, government positions and political structures in the Niger Delta”.[143] Both cults and militia function strong traditional spiritual elements, “mainly based on the revival and strong influence of the Egbesu deity in Ijaw communities”.[144] Finally, many of these threat actors are sophisticated net-warriors as they involve themselves in complex and robust networks, however they may not be technologically elaborate and benefit from the ancillary operational security. Bala argues: “Nigerian security is influenced by a garrison military mentality”.[145] Joab-Peterside also argues that the “state’s approach to security is dominated by the character of deterrence exhibited by unrestrained willingness to show maximum force at the slightest hint of insecurity”.[146] Nigeria’s history of colonialism and 36 years of post-independence military dictatorship have influenced a status quo whereby “force is used for punitive rather than preventative and corrective purposes of civil law enforcement and justice delivery”.[147] Despite over two decades of democracy in Nigeria, its armed forces continue to preponderate over the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) regarding internal security operations. This is despite the NPF being “constitutionally created for and mandated for the task”.[148] The armed forces have displayed steadfast interest in managing internal security operations, oftentimes directly interfering with police efforts.[149] Simultaneously, the military persistently laments how overstretched its forces are and how distracted it is from its primary constitutional responsibility: defending Nigeria’s territorial integrity.[150] The tendency to militarize internal security response has resulted in significant internal distrust and rivalry between the armed forces and its civilian counterparts.[151] Agencies operate as silos and intelligence is more often hoarded, rather than shared.[152] Despite an inordinate amount of disbursement towards the armed forces and numerous kinetic and non-kinetic operations in the Niger Delta Region, oil theft and criminal insurgency remain entrenched. As argued by Hackett, there should only be a “military component” to a holistic grand strategy, “flanked by all instruments of national power, working in concert,” which maneuvers a political end.[153] Nigeria’s military has dominated internal security operations since its independence, although the threat environment in the Niger Delta Region has not much improved. It is time to consider alternative methods and more efficacious and equitable federal resource allocation. The severity of the security situation in Southeastern Nigeria has seen the emergence of hybrid sovereign, non-state (often armed) groups in response to the criminality and weaponary. As mentioned previously, former Niger Delta warlord Government Ekpemupolo (a.k.a. Tompolo) leads Tantita Security Services Nigeria Limited. In August, 2023 Tantita was awarded a one-year contract worth ₦48b (USD32.3m) to provide security services to the Niger Delta Region.[154] This is not the first time the Federal Government has allegedly been contractually involved with Tompolo, as it bought 20 maritime patrol vessels worth over ₦15b (USD103.4m) from Global West Vessel Specialist Limited in 2012, a company widely believed to be owned by him.[155] Tantita currently claims to oversee 9m of its own staff, 38m community youth, and 22m intelligence agents.[156] There appears a clear conflict of interest, or at the very least collusion. Yet, Tompolo’s efforts have attracted praise, and his security forces have displayed successes in-field. Other private security entities do exist, such as Galaxy Security Services.[157] State governments have also established their own hybrid sovereign organizations to maintain security. In January 2020, all six Southern Nigerian states united to establish the Western Nigeria Security Network (WNSN) (a.k.a. Operation Àmò̩té̩kùn, i.e., Operation ‘to kill as fast as a cheetah’ in Yorùbá).[158] Àmò̩té̩kùncontinues to operate across all Southwestern Nigerian states except Lagos, with personnel comprising of “vigilantes, local hunters, community youths, farmers and menial workers”.[159] In April 2021, Ebonyi State setup the Ebube Agu Security apparatus.[160] This was formally disbanded by Nigerian courts early 2023 after evidence suggested the group was involved in “human rights abuses, extortions, illegal arrests and [illegal] use of fire arms”.[161] State governments command no constitutional power to arm indigenous security networks they form, and thus, many groups are in direct breach of Nigeria’s separation of powers and its monopoly over violence.[162] As argued by Bish et al. and Joab-Peterside, many of these state-level hybrid sovereign entities are politicized in the run-up to elections to support or deter certain candidates.[163] This not only undermines public confidence regarding the efficacy of the existence of such groups, but also erodes Nigeria’s democratic process, and contributes to escalating violence. Hybrid sovereign/private actors can provide stability if they are properly overseen and managed within legal frameworks. The presence of so many such actors, and the legacies of misuse, clearly dilute the Federal Government’s monopoly on violence and erodes Nigeria’s sovereignty. The NPF is significantly impeded in its ability to respond to threats associated with systematic oil theft in Nigeria. It functions as a federal police force. As argued by Baje, NPF officers are “inadequately trained, live in dilapidated barracks, and are poorly paid”.[164] At the same time, they are understaffed and/or are diverted to conduct personal private protection. The NPF officially employed over 370,000 officers in August 2023. Nigeria’s population stands at approximately 220m.[165] The International Association of Chiefs of Police recommended ratio of officers to citizens is 3.4:1000, and United Nations’ stands at 1:450.[166] Nigeria currently sits around 1:600, which is insufficient considering the domestic security situation. As argued by Ibrahim, this statistic is also undermined by the fact that around 150,000 of the officers are “engaged in VIP protection, rather than routine policing”.[167] While many Inspector Generals have committed to ceasing rented private protection services from NPF officers, the widespread practice continues.[168] A significant community policing initiative was launched in September 2020, whereby the government allocated ₦13b (USD35m) to absorb 10,000 new constables.[169] Not much has been gained from this, as underlying issues associated with NPF have not been rectified; corruption and mismanagement continue to be widespread; and the oil theft situation has not improved. As argued by Nigerian senator Orji Uzor Kalu, tapping and illegal refining “only make up for a small portion of the theft,” although their “environmental impact is vast”.[170] As argued by Senator Kalu, Okwelum and Tantita spokesmen, the plutocratic insurgency associated with coordinating and managing Nigerian oil theft represents a significant threat to national security.[171] Okwelum highlights there is a tendency to “inflate the quantity stolen in order to magnify the enormity of the scourge and justify the need for deploying the armed forces,” or to “minimize the quantity stolen in order to attenuate the adverse publicity it exposes the industry internationally and collaterally and in order to attract direct foreign investment,” when it suits the “state-oil-complex”.[172] Simultaneously, as argued by Garuba, the presidency of Ibrahim Babangida (1986-1993) also entrenched nepotistic Federal appointments regarding Nigerian oil officials who supervise the industry.[173] As argued by Moses, on the one hand “corrupt resident oil authority officials allow for the successful tapping of oil pipelines,” and on the other “the Nigerian security forces or militant organizations offer guided escorts for the transportation of stolen refined crude oil products”.[174] Indeed, security forces have frequently been accused of “facilitating the disappearance of captured vessels and re-appropriated sale of seized products to foreign markets”.[175] While the Nigerian Navy may report historic destructions of illegal oil refineries, as argued by Bish et al., oil thieves and site owners merely interpret crackdowns as “attempts to pressure them into paying bribes”.[176] Former Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, openly accused the Nigerian military of actively and systematically colluding with oil thieves, and Human Rights Watch cites widespread corruption across all Nigeria’s service branches.[177] On-land state security operations are known to be plagued with corruption too. For example, the Governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Zulum, personally witnessed state security forces associated with ‘Operation Positive Identification’ collect illegal tolls at a checkpoint along the Maiduguri-Damaturu highway.[178] Such extortion justifiably ignites public outcry, and continues to undermine public perceptions of the Armed Forces. As argued by Bamidele Ademola-Olateju, a former commissioner in Ondo State: “[Nigerian] oil theft is not for the poor, it is an extensive racket involving the military, security apparatchiks, politicians, dubious industrial moguls and the oil companies”.[179] Nigerian plutocratic insurgency is naturally obscure, although plenty of admonitions exist, and persisting legislative gaps and elastic legal instruments continue to appear. Both the Ayo Irikefe Commission of Inquiry – an investigation instigated by the Shagari against the Obasanjo administration regarding missing oil assets worth ₦2.8b (USD1.9m) – and the Pius Okigbo Panel of Inquiry – an investigation instigated by the Abacha against the Babangida administration following the post-Gulf War oil bounce of the 1990s – were obfuscated and subdued by corruption.[180] Formal transparency and accountability measures associated with oil theft and federal inquiry have not improved at all. The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mallam Sanusi Lamido, has cited that between January 2012 and July 2013, the NNPC itself was defrauded of 594m barrels of crude valued at approximately USD65.3b, and was only able to recover approximately USD15.5b (24% of the total value) of this lost oil, therefore failing to account for roughly USD49.8b.[181] A more recent controversy involved the Deep Blue Project (DBP), an integrated maritime awareness scheme, led by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA). DBP was funded from the Cabotage Vessel Financing Fund (CVFF).[182] The CVFF was established under the Coastal and Inland Shipping Act (a.k.a. the Cabotage Act of 2003) to foster indigenous tonnage to work within Nigerian waters.[183] Two percent of the CVFF was allocated to Nigerian ship owners so that they could borrow money from the fund at single digit interest rates for littoral cabotage trading.[184] However, in December 2021, a member of the House of Representatives accused NIMASA and then-Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi of diverting USD195m from the CVFF to fund the DBP without House approval.[185] This is despite the fact that no ship owner has successfully accessed the CVFF since its inception.[186] Extra-budgetary expenditures known as ‘security votes’ are also known to be flagrantly abused.[187] As highlighted by Bala, these funds are “not subject to the government executives’ declaration and not under the scrutiny of the public or even the established government auditing institutions of the anti-corruption agencies”.[188] These pseudo slush funds operate formally and informally, and are used to realize political and personal objectives. Transparency International exposed these ‘security votes’ account for around USD670m annually.[189] As argued by Bala, this dwarfs the annual international security assistance Nigeria receives. It is more than the Nigerian Army’s budget, more than the Nigerian Navy and Air Force’s annual budgets combined, and exceeds 70% of the Nigerian Police Force’s annual budget.[190] More transparent frameworks are necessary in order to restore public confidence, and more impartial resource allocation is desperately needed. Ex parte law is also brazenly abused, with the use of emergency judicial decisions in legal cases. Convener of the Transparent Bar Initiative, Douglas Ogbankwa, has faulted some law enforcement agencies regarding their frequently arbitrary and coercive use.[191] He highlighted that many ex parte motions “were done without the knowledge of the account holders, who should be aware of the situation in order to defend themselves”.[192] Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, also recently stated that the abuse of ex parte orders in political cases by judges should be curbed.[193] “To curb it, it is imperative that the National Judicial Council exercises stringent oversight. We recommend prompt and decisive punishment for judges who are found to abuse their authority in this manner”.[194] Significant legislative gaps also exist. Both Nigeria’s Terrorist Acts (2011 and 2013) lack a national definition for terrorism, and the Federal Government’s stance regarding negotiation with threat actors is not clear.[195] Likewise, no laws currently regulate the management of ill-gotten-gains associated with kidnapping and piracy following criminal capture.[196] Seized illegal proceeds are always forfeited to the Federal Government. Pervasive and systematic nepotism also undermines rule of law and due process. As highlighted by Bala, government/military appointments are typically defined across ethno-religious and political lines rather than meritocracy.[197] Such practices “breed disregard for the rule of law,” and jeopardize interagency synergy.[198] Prevalent corruption across Nigeria continues to create dysfunctional sovereignty, which will continue to encourage irregular threat actors. Nigeria currently does not operate State Police, although discussion regarding their formation is occurring in government. While some local police forces did exist in the 1960s, all were either eventually absorbed into the NPF or dismantled following military dictatorship.[199] The topic of state police has been fiercely contested, as many believe they should have been reinstated in 1999, following the end of military dictatorship.[200] House of Assembly speakers from across all 36 states recently announced their support for the proposal in a communiqué.[201] State legislators still need to endorse an official amendment to be passed onto the National Assembly.[202] However, two-thirds of Nigeria’s National Assembly must endorse it, followed by the President, for it to be realized.[203] President Bola Tinubu has championed and campaigned for State Police for decades, and thus he is unlikely to reject it.[204] Noticeable supporters include Senate President Godswill Akpabio and former President Goodluck Jonathan.[205] Although, while the Minister of Police Affairs, Senator Ibrahim Gaidam has shown his support, the Inspector General of Police directly contradicts him.[206] Many have argued for a long time that the adoption of state police would enable more effective and efficient policing.[207] Advocates highlight current limitations regarding the highly centralized command associated with the NPF. Nwogwugwu and Kupoluyi explain that a federally centralized police system alienates police as an institution and a service from rural communities.[208] As argued by Moliki, Nkwede, and Dauda: “The peculiarity of the security challenges of each state can be better managed by the officers who understands the language, geography and the peculiar security challenge of the people they would be policing”.[209] Considering Nigeria is home to over 300 ethnic groups who vary across a range of social, religious, economic, and geographic factors, Tony also highlights the need for “a policing model that is adaptable and sensitive to local contexts”.[210] It is this line of argument, focused around “local exclusiveness”, which Senator Ibrahim Gaidam, Minister of Police Affairs, champions too. While states currently administer their own magistrates, high courts, assemblies and legislators, they do not command the concomitant powers to police their own territories.[211] While this does consolidate the Federal Government’s monopoly on violence, state sovereignty is affected, and the NPF remain spread thin across 774 localities commanded from Abuja.[212] Conversely, ex-Lagos police commissioner, Abubakar Tsav, stated that the “establishment of state police will signal the beginning of the disintegration of the country,” as he believes that state governments would deploy their new forces “against their perceived political opponents”.[213] In 2018 he argued that politicians “are not civilized enough and tolerant of opposing views and cannot preside over a competent and impartial police force”.[214] His sentiments have been echoed by many, including the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Kayode Egbetokun, although such arguments often extend to also include ethnic, community, and religious adversaries too.[215] As observed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Abbas Tajudeen, “there is a palpable fear among our citizens – a fear of potential tyranny and the misuse of police powers if control is devolved to the state level”.[216] Indeed, the Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) in 1958 and the Willink Commission both opposed regional police on these grounds.[217] Alternatively, Emeritus Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, John Cardinal Onaiyekan, Assistant Inspector General of Police, Ben Okolo, and the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi all suggest mending the dire state of the NPF first.[218] This includes hiring more officers, improving their welfare package, and enhancing overall NPF capabilities and infrastructure. Simultaneously, the Assistant Inspector General suggested merging the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Commission (NSCDC) and the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) under the command of the NPF.[219] State police could very well be misused, and punishing such practices would represent a new responsibility for the NPF. Considering that the current separation of powers is murky, appropriate transparency and accountability measures could enhance state-federal cooperation, facilitate more autonomous state level security, and ultimately contribute to healthier national unity. In order to tackle the twin insurgency, the Federal Government must not merely continue to invest in improving its police and military, but also seriously consider more substantive and equitable socioeconomic development and DDR in the Niger Delta Region. Romsom argues that both Nigeria and Brazil “show characteristics of the state as smuggler model”.[220] While criminal insurgency is not so prevalent in Brazil, as the majority of criminals stealing oil do not overtly espouse sovereignty aspirations, plutocratic insurgency is nonetheless rife. Oil theft has evolved into a conspicuous threat in Brazil since around 2014, when it reported a single incident.[221] In 2016, 73 incidents were reported.[222] Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras), the Brazilian state oil company observed that most of the oil theft that year occurred on the São Paulo-Rio de Janeiro axis, which is where five of the company’s largest refineries are located.[223] Above and below ground, hot and cold taps are erected by Brazilian oil thieves, much like in Nigeria, although the quantities they steal is markedly less significant.[224] In November 2023, approximately 30,000 liters of stolen fuel were intercepted by police, taken from the São Paulo-Brasília (Osbra) pipeline, which supplies the International Airport of Brasilia.[225] Four men were arrested, and around R$780,000 (USD138,000) worth of damage was inflicted.[226] Killings have been linked to oil theft operations, and there are indications that ‘turf’ wars exist between gangs regarding where their taps reside.[227] A few incidents have caused spills too.[228] Much like in Nigeria, criminals use tanker and water trucks to smuggle stolen fuel to concealed artisanal refineries, after which it is sold at illegal service stations or small-town, streetside vendors.[229] Brazil’s Federal Highway Police have increased the number of roadblocks they operate between Rio and São Paulo, although as observed in Nigeria, these may be easily circumvented by organized criminals.[230] Brazilian groups have previously generated false cargo invoices to deceive police.[231] Roadside hijackings of fuel trucks also regularly occur, with around ten cases a week occurring between the Gabriel Passos Refinery and the Ring Road.[232] Drivers do not typically suffer any injuries during these incidents, although the frequency with which they occur is increasing.[233] Brazilian law enforcement has responded and successfully dismantled many gangs associated with oil theft. Indeed, Transpetro, the logistics unit of Petrobras, reported a 60% decline in fuel theft at its pipes in São Paulo in 2020.[234] In June, three full and four empty trucks were seized in Fazenda Garcia, in Guapimirim, in the Baixada Fluminense, following an anonymous tip, which cited seeing 15 armed men.[235] A 100,000 liters of stolen fuel were seized, and one man was eventually detained.[236] Likewise, in May 2024 an adulterated fuel laboratory was dismantled by police, in Dias d'Ávila, Salvador, Bahia.[237] 600,000 liters of adulterated fuel were seized, including diesel, gasoline and ethanol, which was likely destined to be resold to gas stations.[238] Ten trucks and three fixed tanks were found (storing cargo worth R$3.3m [USD584,000]), as well as suction machines, hoses, gloves, dye, fuel symbology plates, samples of fuel types, and accounting documents.[239] Another adulterated fuel laboratory was also previously shut down by police in Feira de Santana, in January 2024.[240] Overall, theft overall costs Transpetro over R$150m (USD28.2m) a year.[241] Gangs may be quickly formed and dismantled, and may steal millions in less than a year.[242] A police operation in July 2023, which served 47 search and seizure warrants across Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and Paraná exposed one such group.[243] Three chiefs oversaw the organization: one was responsible for scouts and drivers; another managed logistics and clandestine fuel derivation and extraction; and one was the financial director.[244] Specialists also included tap installers, recruiters who targeted professionals who worked mainly on oil platforms, welders, truck suppliers and false invoice forgers.[245] Harsher penalties were recently introduced specifically concerning fuel theft. In April, Brazil’s Infrastructure Commission passed bill 828/2022, which increased the punishment regarding theft of petroleum or derivatives, natural gas, hydrated ethyl alcohol, fuel, or other fuel fluids from four to ten years imprisonment, plus a fine.[246] Receipt of such illicit products will earn the same punishment.[247] Senator Alessandro Vieira also partially accepted an amendment proposed by Senator Luis Carlos Heinze to include biofuels as well.[248] The rapporteur added that the storage of such illegal fuel products may also be considered a crime.[249] Nonetheless, oil thieves in Brazil are markedly white-collar. Indeed, as argued by Slattery, Brazilian criminals “have infiltrated the four largest gasoline chains in Brazil,” whereby they are estimated to control “hundreds, if not thousands,” of service stations.[250] Paulo Miranda, head of the industry group Fecombustíveis, cites that First Capital Command (one of Brazil's most notorious organized criminal groups) controls approximately 300 gas stations in São Paulo state alone, which accounts for 3% of Brazil’s pumps.[251] Oil grafting at stations is lucrative, and Instituto Combustive Legal estimates the illicit industry to be valued at around R$23b (USD4.2b) a year.[252] Many groups also fence illicit petroleum products through asphalt companies too.[253] Oil criminals in Brazil also exploit petroleum tax regimes between states, as they vary widely region-to-region.[254] Ethanol tax in Rio de Janeiro is 32%, compared to 13% in neighboring São Paulo.[255] This creates huge incentive to conduct criminality across state lines. Brazilian think tank Fundação Getúlio Vargasestimated that criminals reaped approximately R$7.2b (USD1.3b) in 2019 through such fuel tax evasion alone.[256] Oil theft in Mexico has divulged into a glaringly similar situation to Nigeria, whereby billions of dollars of oil are unaccounted for each year by the state oil company Pemex. Colombia and Venezuela are also affected, although to a lesser degree. In Colombia, siphoned oil is increasingly refined into “pategrillo,” a low-grade fuel fabricated at illegal refineries used to produce cocaine.[257] Smith observes a positive relationship in Colombia between increased cocaine production and increased oil theft.[258] Considering that at least 22 organized crime groups operate across approximately one-quarter of Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, it is likely that a similar dynamic functions in Brazil.[259] A myriad of similar, different, and competing hybrid sovereign and private security actors function policing across Brazil.[260] As argued by Durão, Larkins, and Argentin, the Brazilian federal police have not effectively regulated state branches regarding the widespread practice of ‘bico’, whereby police establish or participate in private security. Through a series of interviews, they discovered that such practices are “not only tolerated, but even encouraged by police superiors”.[261] “Rather than seeing the blurring between different fields of security and police and crime as signs of incomplete democratization or incomplete regulation,” Durão, Larkins and Argentin (2023) observe jurisdictional ambiguity as an “intentional productive force which allows for material gain for key actors, in this case police officers themselves”.[262] Nonetheless, they argue that “the confusion between public and private policing for some may essentially mean earning extra money, but for many others it constitutes an endless extension of power, violence, entrepreneurship and political influence”.[263] Such is the case in Nigeria as well, and both the Brazilian and the Nigerian government must do more to better regulate these non-state security forces to ameliorate public confidence, and/or strengthen and consolidate official state forces so that there may be no need for extraneous redundancies. Transparency International attributed a score of 36/100 (i.e., 0=highly corrupt and 100=very clean) to Brazil in 2023, placing it 104/180 on its global corruption perceptions index.[264] In 2012, Brazil scored 43/100, an all-time historic peak, just before the massive Lava Jato corruption scandal enveloped the state oil company Petrobras, and numerous contractors and politicians.[265] Brazil’s overall corruption is incrementally worsening, which will likely exacerbate oil theft across the country. Its security architecture has also been observed to be significantly affected by a lack of transparency, police brutality, machismo, and prejudice toward certain minority groups.[266] Simultaneously, Milícia have existed across Brazil for more than half a century.[267] Their current form spawned from Rio de Janeiro’s favelas in the late 1990s and early 2000s, under the pretense of residential narco protection.[268] Predominantly comprised of active-duty and retired police officers, milícia extort rent from communities under their assumed control.[269] In 2013, it was found that across approximately 1,000 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, 45% were controlled by milícia organizations and 37% by narcos.[270] Milícia are known to control telecommunication towers, internet cables, and TV providers, so much so, a special police task force had to be created in October 2020 to respond.[271] By May 2021, over 20 clandestine internet and cable TV providers were ceased and over 600 milícia members were arrested.[272] Losses to the economy were estimated near R$1.1b (USD195m).[273] 26 telecommunication masts across Rio de Janeiro were also compromised that year.[274] Milícia are known to participate in oil theft and the sale of bootleg product to service stations.[275] As argued by Sullivan and Bunker, “the state-militia nexus amplifies criminal competition for control yielding a hybrid form of criminal-political violence.[276] Information regarding corruption associated with Brazilian oil theft is scarce. Although in 2017, Brazilian police suspected insider threats in Petrobras to have helped setup illegal taps near the Duque de Caxias refinery, as they were observed to be precisely engineered.[277] Moreover, Marcelo Queiroz dos Anjos, a captain in the Military Police, was the head of an oil theft gang which operated in the municipalities of the Baixada Fluminense.[278] Although he surrendered to police in 2021, which accelerated the demise of his organization, the group nonetheless stole a total of 169,500 liters of oil and caused Transpetro/Petrobras a loss of about R$2m (USD354,000).[279] Police eventually arrested four others and served 14 search and seizure warrants.[280] Another gang dismantled in July 2023 involved three brothers, two military police officers, and an outsourced Transpetro employee.[281] The group had managed to inflict losses worth around R$1b (USD175m).[282] Considering that oil theft continues in Brazil, and the scale of influence organized criminals command across it, it is highly likely that insider threats persist. Petrobras is also a state-owned entity, so it is likely that insider threats extend into the Brazilian government as well, as Lava Jato revealed. Oil theft in Nigeria is dire, and the situation in Brazil reveals symptoms previously observed in Mexico. There is no universal response to threats associated with oil theft, although both the Brazilian and Nigerian governments can do more to remedy dysfunctional sovereignty and underdevelopment. Plenty of information is available regarding Nigerian oil theft, although more transparency, accountability, and enforcement around the issue is necessary. The prospect of State Police represents an exciting, albeit precarious opportunity for Nigeria, as their presence may be used to refocus state responses around more indigenous law enforcement, rather than predominantly kinetic military activities. Nonetheless, all Nigerian security forces must demonstrate better behaviour regarding discrimination, brutality, corruption, and extra-judicial abuse in order to mend public trust and de jure authority more generally. Industrial actors must also rehabilitate community sentiment regarding environmental degradation and exploitation. The Patriotic Liberation Front in Niger also recently attacked the PetroChina-funded Niger-Benin crude oil pipeline, paralyzing the pipeline and killing six, to coerce the cancellation of a USD400m China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) oil deal signed in April.[283] Onshore oil investment across West Africa will continue to be stifled if the security situation more generally does not improve, and the Nigerian government should be wary of how regional oil related instabilities influence violence and theft dynamics across the Niger Delta, and vice versa. Information regarding oil theft in Brazil as a whole is scare, although it is clear that elements of Gilman’s twin insurgency function at the pipes, the pumps, and among Brazil’s plutocratic elite. State security forces, much like Nigerian ones, have frequently dismantled oil theft gangs, criminal extractive tools, and illegal refineries, although the problem persists. Both countries are observed to operate/allow hybrid sovereign and/or private security contractors to combat oil theft. While a few have proven themselves, the patchwork of security actors involved nonetheless undermines and complicates state sovereignty, its monopoly on violence, and creates jurisdictional ambiguities. Regulation rather than standardization/absorption may realize more efficacious and fair security, as positive aspects of local tailoring may be exploited under adequate legal frameworks and oversights, although this is easier said than done. Nonetheless, all security sector reform must to be paired with significant government-community dialog and socio-economic development in order to dismantle environmental drivers which influence crime and insurgency. The Nigerian government has a lot of work to do before it can claim symbiosis with Niger Delta Communities, assuage foreign investors, and dethrone Algeria to once again become the leading African oil producer. Likewise, the Brazilian government must also do more to prevent the oil theft situation from deteriorating into that observed in Mexico.[284] Endnotes [1] Robert J.

Title: TD Cowen backs CrowdStrike with Buy rating, highlights $116B market opportunity by 2025
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/td-cowen-backs-crowdstrike-with-buy-rating-highlights-116b-market-opportunity-by-2025-93CH-3626848
Time Published: 2024-09-22T23:05:56Z
Full Content:
On Friday, TD Cowen maintained its Buy rating on shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) with a steadfast price target of $380.00. The firm's outlook remains positive as CrowdStrike introduced a comprehensive range of updates to its Falcon platform, which is anticipated to broaden its total addressable market (TAM) to $116 billion by the calendar year 2025. The firm acknowledged potential challenges, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s likely move to limit kernel level access for security vendors. Nevertheless, the firm is confident that such changes will not undermine CrowdStrike's long-term competitive position, citing the critical nature of the Falcon platform's mission. TD Cowen also addressed the issue of customer retention, noting that there have been no significant signs of client turnover following service disruptions. This observation supports the firm's belief that the forecasts for CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue (ARR) by fiscal year 2026 are on the conservative side. The firm's endorsement of CrowdStrike's stock reflects confidence in the company's growth prospects and the strategic value of its product offerings. The Falcon platform's innovations are viewed as a key driver for expansion within the cybersecurity market. The $380.00 price target suggests that TD Cowen sees substantial upside potential for CrowdStrike's stock. The firm's rating and target are based on the company's strategic updates, market opportunity, and resilience in the face of industry challenges. In other recent news, CrowdStrike Holdings has been the focus of several analyst reviews and strategic initiatives. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed a Buy rating on CrowdStrike with a revised price target of $324, following the cybersecurity firm's Fal.Con 2024 conference. The company's Falcon Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) product was highlighted, contributing to more than a 65% average increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). Scotiabank, Truist Securities, CapitalOne, and Piper Sandler maintained their respective ratings, reflecting confidence in CrowdStrike's growth potential despite uncertainties surrounding near-term financial projections. CrowdStrike exceeded expectations in its second fiscal quarter in terms of ARR, revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share, although the guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2025 fell short of consensus estimates. The company's management reiterated their long-term ARR goal of $10 billion by the fiscal year 2031. To achieve this, CrowdStrike launched strategic initiatives such as CrowdStrike Financial Services and established partnerships with Dazz and 1Password to enhance cloud security measures. These recent developments follow CrowdStrike's successful navigation through a major challenge earlier this year when a software update led to global outages. The company's crisis management skills were put to the test and subsequently showcased at their Fal.Con 2024 event. The company's ability to acquire new customers, as well as its strategies for upselling and cross-selling, are expected to be key factors influencing the company's revenue through 2025. As CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) continues to innovate and expand its Falcon platform, real-time data from InvestingPro aligns with TD Cowen's optimistic view of the company's growth potential. With a robust market cap of $67.99 billion, CrowdStrike's financial health is underlined by a substantial cash position that eclipses its debt, suggesting a solid foundation for future investments and growth. Additionally, the company's impressive revenue growth of over 33% in the last twelve months as of Q2 2025 highlights its strong performance in the cybersecurity sector. InvestingPro Tips further reveal that analysts are expecting net income growth this year for CrowdStrike, which could reinforce investor confidence. While the company trades at high valuation multiples, such as a P/E ratio of 396.59 and a Price/Book ratio of 23.83, these figures reflect its high growth trajectory and market confidence in its strategic direction. Moreover, the company has demonstrated a high return over the last year, with a price total return of 62.99%, showcasing its strong market performance.

Title: Is Amazon’s RTO Mandate A Signal For Other CEOs To End Remote Work?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2024/09/22/is-amazons-rto-mandate-a-signal-for-other-ceos-to-end-remote-work/

Many other companies are likely to follow a RTO mandate for two reasons. Slowly but surely, as the pandemic's unique circumstances fade, companies are backtracking on hybrid and remote work arrangements and rapidly restoring pre-pandemic business norms. Companies like Dell, Salesforce, and Bank of America have already established return-to-office (RTO) policies. Walmart recently joined the RTO mandate but is attempting to address concerns with a state-of-the-art, 350-acre campus designed to build community and make in-office work more appealing to employees accustomed to flexible arrangements. Amazon is the latest company to take a stricter stance on RTO. In a recent memo, CEO Andy Jassy announced that all employees will be required to return to the office five days a week starting January 2, 2025. Jassy aims to strengthen Amazon's culture and teams, aspiring to operate like "the world's largest startup." Like others before it, Amazon's decision has sparked debate, drawing both detractors and proponents. Detractors argue that remote work leads to happier, more productive employees. Some even suggest that RTO policies are thinly veiled cost-cutting measures, allowing companies to avoid traditional layoffs. Dropbox, for example, has fully embraced virtual work, reinforcing that remote setups can thrive. On the other side, proponents of in-office work emphasize benefits like mentorship and addressing isolation issues. Nearly 4 in 10 parents say they go days without leaving their house when working from home, and 33% report feeling "very isolated," according to the Modern Family Index conducted by The Harris Poll for Bright Horizons. This debate over the ideal work environment is unlikely to end soon. However, RTO policies offer advantages in two critical areas for companies looking to strengthen their culture and teams. A KPMG survey reveals that 79% of CEOs expect their hybrid employees to return full-time to the office by 2027, an abrupt rise from just 34% earlier this year. Jassy and other CEOs like Starbucks' Brian Niccol believe teams should be together as much as possible, as shared in Bloomberg. Jassy's memo emphasized that being in the office makes it "easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another." Amazon wants to act like a startup—agile, fast, and efficient. Reducing barriers to these goals is the bet Amazon and other companies are making with these policy reversals. Moreover, RTO could mitigate some of the negative aspects of remote work, such as isolation and loneliness, along with blurred work-life boundaries. According to a Wall Street Journal report, remote employees sometimes feel heavily isolated and akin to feeling more like mercenaries than part of a cohesive unit. As organizations grow, they often become mired in red tape and bureaucratic inefficiencies. These inefficiencies can frustrate employees and slow down operations, affecting overall performance. Jassy's memo hints at these challenges: "Do we have the right org structure to drive the level of ownership and speed we desire?" The frustration with unnecessary meetings, excessive layers of approval, and prolonged deliberation is widespread. Jassy's note echoes this sentiment: "pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere." Unfortunately, communication can suffer when teams disperse, and the company grows. By returning to the office, Amazon aims to streamline communication, reduce management layers, and empower individual contributors. The goal is to see improvements in performance, collaboration, and overall culture. With Amazon's latest RTO policy, companies are signaling that they view flexible work arrangements as a benefit, not a given right. Management and organizations are reverting back to pre-COVID business norms, where leaders can interact face-to-face with their teams rather than through a monitor. While remote work and hybrid arrangements have advantages, only time will tell which approach best supports the organization and its people in the modern business world. One Community. Many Voices.

September 22, 2024 12:21 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: CrowdStrike (CRWD), Press Reports Ex-Employees Say “‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” Securities Class Action Pending - Hagens Berman

September 22, 2024 12:03 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 12, 2024, SEMAFOR reported that software engineers at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike “complained about rushed deadlines, excessive workloads, and increasing technical problems to higher-ups for more than a year before a catastrophic failure of its software paralyzed airlines and knocked banking and other services offline for hours.” Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys.

(CRWD): According to the September 12, 2024 reporting by SEMAFOR, in the wake of CrowdStrike’s disastrous update to its flagship Falcon Sensor security product that contained a bug that caused a massive overnight outage affecting 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, a certain former employee said “‘[s]peed was the most important thing’” and “‘[q]uality control was not really part of our process or conversation.’” The SEMAFOR article, “CrowdStrike ex employees: ‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” states “[a]lmost two dozen former software engineers, managers, managers and other staff described a workplace where executives prioritized speed over quality, workers weren’t always sufficiently trained, and mistakes around coding and other tasks were rising.” SEMAFOR also reported that “[o]ne former senior manager said they sat in multiple meetings where staff warned company leaders that CrowdStrike would ‘fail’ its customers by releasing products that couldn’t be supported.” The pending litigation focuses on the propriety of CrowdStrike’s representations concerning the efficacy of its AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform, including assurances that its technology was “validated, certified, and tested.” The complaint alleges that CrowdStrike’s assurances were false and misleading because the company failed to disclose that: (1) it instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to the company. The company’s assurances came into question beginning on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” The news was accompanied by several analyst downgrades with one at Guggenheim downgrading CrowdStrike from buy to neutral, reportedly writing that “[t]he restoration of its reputation may take more time and will likely affect new business signings at least in the near-term.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down $84.24 (-24%) since July 18, 2024.

Our bots search the internet for the lowest prices, so you donât have to waste time checking multiple sites. We donât use gimmicksâjust straightforward, unbiased data. If you're looking for the cheapest way to stack gold, this is your go-to resource. We automatically update deals every hour. The deals on this page are current as of 12:03 UTC on 2024-09-27. Email paydirt@dirtcheapgold.com Gold has historically been considered a strong store of value, especially during times of economic uncertainty or inflation. Over the long term, the price of gold has steadily increased, reflecting its role as a hedge against currency depreciation and market volatility. While gold may not offer the same short-term returns as stocks, it tends to retain its value over time, making it a popular choice for preserving wealth. However, like any investment, its performance can fluctuate, and it's important to consider it as part of a diversified portfolio. A stacker is someone who accumulates precious metals, like gold or silver, as a form of wealth preservation. Stackers typically prefer physical bullion such as coins or bars and focus on long-term investment strategies. The goal is often to "stack" as much metal as possible to protect against inflation or economic uncertainty. Most stackers aim to accumulate 5-10% of their net worth in metal. Stacking starts with choosing the right type of gold for your collection. Most beginners opt for popular 1 ounce coins or bars like the American Gold Eagle or Canadian Maple Leaf. Make sure to buy from reputable dealers, compare premiums over spot price, and consider storage options like a safe or bank vault. Diversify your purchases over time, and be mindful of your budget, ensuring that you buy when the price aligns with your goals. The premium on gold coins and bars is the additional cost above the spot price of gold. This premium covers manufacturing, minting, distribution, and dealer costs. Coins tend to have higher premiums than bars due to their intricate designs and collectible value, whereas bars are usually closer to the spot price because they are simpler to produce. We focus on 1-ounce gold bars and coins because they are the most popular and widely traded form of gold bullion. They offer a great balance between affordability and liquidity, making them ideal for both new investors and experienced stackers. Larger bars might offer lower premiums, but 1-ounce products are more flexible when it comes to buying, selling, or trading. Costco began selling gold to members in 2023, offering 1 oz gold bars primarily through its online store. Executive members can enjoy a 2% discount, and using the Costco Anywhere Visa card adds an additional 2% cashback â a combined 4% discount that you'll receive later in the form of a rebate. These savings make Costco a competitive option for purchasing gold, though stock is often limited and sells out quickly. Costco's products don't always appear in the main list on this page, but the table below shows all of the 1 ounce gold products currently available on Costco's website. The discounted prices of these products might make them competitive with products from other sellers. ð¢ Costco doesn't have any 1 ounce gold products for sale right now. Purchase from Costco or Walmart. Those sellers don't have higher prices or fees for credit cards. Storing your gold securely is crucial to protecting your investment. Many stackers choose to store their gold in a home safe, but itâs important to ensure it is fireproof and bolted down. Alternatively, you can store gold in a bank's safe deposit box or a specialized vault service, which offers additional layers of security and insurance. Whether you need to pay sales tax on gold depends on your location. In many states or countries, precious metals like gold are exempt from sales tax if purchased for investment purposes, especially above certain thresholds. Itâs important to check local tax laws to see if exemptions apply where you live. Selling gold is relatively straightforward. You can sell to local coin shops, bullion dealers, or on online platforms like r/Pmsforsale that specialize in precious metals. Itâs important to shop around for the best offer, as prices and premiums may vary. Ensure you understand any fees involved before making a transaction. The amount you can sell your gold for depends on the current spot price of gold and the type of gold you are selling. Dealers will typically offer you slightly below the spot price to cover their costs, and this is known as the buyback price. The condition and purity of your gold, as well as market demand, can also affect the price. Shop around for competitive offers, and always sell to a reputable dealer to get the best value.

Investors seeking stocks that can withstand short-term pressures and deliver over the long term should track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is game developer Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). In August, the company reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Recently, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated a buy rating on Take-Two Interactive stock with a price target of $172. The analyst is upbeat about the company's upcoming releases and expects its bookings to increase by at least 40% in the next fiscal year following mid-single-digit growth this year. Sebastian's robust bookings growth estimate is backed by the expected release of key titles – Civilization VII, Borderlands 4 and the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI). Moreover, he expects the company's new console/PC releases to deliver about $2.25 billion in incremental bookings. He anticipates the mobile business will contribute around $3.1 billion, and catalog/live services will generate $2.5 billion in the full year. While management has expressed high confidence in its ability to release GTA VI next year, the analyst thinks that any potential delay between two fiscal years would have a limited impact on TTWO's two-year earnings path. He expects this vital release to generate about $3 billion of bookings in the first year, while enhancing the company's financial flexibility with over $2 billion in free cash flow. "Beyond the next 12-24 months, Take Two should benefit from the long-tail of live services/catalog sales and further depth in the pipeline with sequels to Red Dead, BioShock and Max Payne, and perhaps new 2K sports franchises," said Sebastian. Sebastian ranks No. 286 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.8%. (See TTWO Ownership Structure on TipRanks) Baird analyst Peter Benedict is bullish on the prospects of membership-only warehouse chain Costco Wholesale (COST). Earlier this month, Costco reported a 7.1% rise in its net sales for the retail month of August (the four weeks ended Sept. 1). Excluding the impact of changes on gasoline prices and foreign exchange, Costco's August comparable sales also grew 7.1%. Benedict noted that the August comparable sales growth was sequentially steady compared to the 7.2% increase in July, as stronger traffic was offset by some moderation in average traffic growth. Benedict increased his Q4 fiscal 2024 EPS estimate to $5.10 compared to the Street's consensus estimate of $5.07 per share to reflect better-than-expected sales in the fiscal quarter. "COST's traction with consumers continues to stand out against an increasingly challenged spending backdrop," said the analyst. Benedict highlighted that the company delivered solid core comparable sales growth yet again and displayed persistent strength in the non-foods area, even as there is continued softness in discretionary categories across most of the retail sector. The analyst thinks that Costco's "growth staple" appeal remains intact, thanks to its consistent performance, store network expansion, encouraging membership key performance indicators and the recently announced fee hike. He reiterated a buy rating on COST stock with a price target of $975. Benedict ranks No. 30 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.1%. (See COST Options Trading on TipRanks) Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) is the third pick for this week. Despite macro pressures and intense competition in the streaming space, the company has been able to impress investors with its crackdown on password sharing and the rollout of an ad-supported tier. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth contends that while "advertising is not in NFLX's DNA" and the company is creating the ad tier from scratch, it has the ability to emerge as a major ad player as scale and monetization grow in 2025 and beyond. He estimates that ad revenue, excluding the subscriptions component, will account for more than 10% of the company's revenue in 2027. The analyst acknowledges that the scale of Netflix's ad tier currently lags behind that of peers like Amazon, which gained from automatically including its Prime members in its ad-supported tier. That said, he is confident that Netflix can boost its scale by making changes in plans and pricing, bundling offers and providing live content that has extensive appeal. Anmuth further explained that while Netflix's ad tier is dilutive to its overall average revenue per member, the impressive 150% growth in the company's upfront ad sales commitments, greater scale and improved focus on ad formats and ad tech should drive higher monetization. Overall, Anmuth is optimistic about Netflix's ability to grow its top line in the mid-teens this year and in 2025, further improve its margins, and deliver multi-year free cash flow growth.

Investors seeking stocks that can withstand short-term pressures and deliver over the long term should track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is game developer Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). In August, the company reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Recently, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated a buy rating on Take-Two Interactive stock with a price target of $172. The analyst is upbeat about the company's upcoming releases and expects its bookings to increase by at least 40% in the next fiscal year following mid-single-digit growth this year. Sebastian's robust bookings growth estimate is backed by the expected release of key titles – Civilization VII, Borderlands 4 and the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI). Moreover, he expects the company's new console/PC releases to deliver about $2.25 billion in incremental bookings. He anticipates the mobile business will contribute around $3.1 billion, and catalog/live services will generate $2.5 billion in the full year. While management has expressed high confidence in its ability to release GTA VI next year, the analyst thinks that any potential delay between two fiscal years would have a limited impact on TTWO's two-year earnings path. He expects this vital release to generate about $3 billion of bookings in the first year, while enhancing the company's financial flexibility with over $2 billion in free cash flow. "Beyond the next 12-24 months, Take Two should benefit from the long-tail of live services/catalog sales and further depth in the pipeline with sequels to Red Dead, BioShock and Max Payne, and perhaps new 2K sports franchises," said Sebastian. Sebastian ranks No. 286 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.8%. (See TTWO Ownership Structure on TipRanks) Baird analyst Peter Benedict is bullish on the prospects of membership-only warehouse chain Costco Wholesale (COST). Earlier this month, Costco reported a 7.1% rise in its net sales for the retail month of August (the four weeks ended Sept. 1). Excluding the impact of changes on gasoline prices and foreign exchange, Costco's August comparable sales also grew 7.1%. Benedict noted that the August comparable sales growth was sequentially steady compared to the 7.2% increase in July, as stronger traffic was offset by some moderation in average traffic growth. Benedict increased his Q4 fiscal 2024 EPS estimate to $5.10 compared to the Street's consensus estimate of $5.07 per share to reflect better-than-expected sales in the fiscal quarter. "COST's traction with consumers continues to stand out against an increasingly challenged spending backdrop," said the analyst. Benedict highlighted that the company delivered solid core comparable sales growth yet again and displayed persistent strength in the non-foods area, even as there is continued softness in discretionary categories across most of the retail sector. The analyst thinks that Costco's "growth staple" appeal remains intact, thanks to its consistent performance, store network expansion, encouraging membership key performance indicators and the recently announced fee hike. He reiterated a buy rating on COST stock with a price target of $975. Benedict ranks No. 30 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.1%. (See COST Options Trading on TipRanks) Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) is the third pick for this week. Despite macro pressures and intense competition in the streaming space, the company has been able to impress investors with its crackdown on password sharing and the rollout of an ad-supported tier. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth contends that while "advertising is not in NFLX's DNA" and the company is creating the ad tier from scratch, it has the ability to emerge as a major ad player as scale and monetization grow in 2025 and beyond. He estimates that ad revenue, excluding the subscriptions component, will account for more than 10% of the company's revenue in 2027. The analyst acknowledges that the scale of Netflix's ad tier currently lags behind that of peers like Amazon, which gained from automatically including its Prime members in its ad-supported tier. That said, he is confident that Netflix can boost its scale by making changes in plans and pricing, bundling offers and providing live content that has extensive appeal. Anmuth further explained that while Netflix's ad tier is dilutive to its overall average revenue per member, the impressive 150% growth in the company's upfront ad sales commitments, greater scale and improved focus on ad formats and ad tech should drive higher monetization. Overall, Anmuth is optimistic about Netflix's ability to grow its top line in the mid-teens this year and in 2025, further improve its margins, and deliver multi-year free cash flow growth. He reaffirmed a buy rating on NFLX stock with a price target of $750. Anmuth ranks No. 99 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.7%. (See NFLX Financials on TipRanks) Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, providing more insight into their recent decision to reduce interest rates. Friday's release of the August Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will show whether inflation continues to slow. Investors can expect fresh data on new and pending home sales, along with an update on housing prices, and consumer sentiment surveys. Micron Technology (MU), Costco Wholesale (COST), Accenture (ACN), and more will also report earnings. Monday, Sept. 23 Tuesday, Sept. 24 Wednesday, Sept. 25 Thursday, Sept. 26 Friday, Sept. 27 Following last week’s closely watched Federal Reserve decision to enact a jumbo-sized interest rate cut, investors will hear from Fed officials this week about their impressions of the U.S. economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at Thursday’s 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference, his first remarks since last week’s press conference. Other notable speakers will deliver remarks at the event, including New York Fed President John Williams, Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, and Boston Fed President Susan Collins are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, market watchers will likely be focused on the latest inflation data, as the August reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will show whether price pressures continue to cool. The July PCE reading showed the Fed’s preferred inflation measurement was down to an annual rate of 2.5%, still higher than the central bank’s target. Investors will look for more progress on inflation. KB Home’s earnings report on Tuesday could also provide some insight into the health of the housing market. According to a Bank of America analysis, the Fed’s interest rate decision is likely to drive down mortgage rates and potentially improve homebuilders' performance. Memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner Micron Technology will report earnings Wednesday, after Morgan Stanley recently downgraded its stock, warning about the health of the memory chip market. Micron’s report comes after its prior quarter earnings were lower than analysts projected, and its revenue guidance disappointed investors. Costco’s earnings on Thursday follows its recent decision to raise membership fees for the first time in seven years, effective Sept. 1. Analysts are expecting the retailer to report higher year-over-year revenue and profit, with memberships rising to 75 million.

Title: After The Fed Rate Cut: Soft Landing Checklist
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/09/22/after-the-fed-rate-cut-soft-landing-checklist/
Time Published: 2024-09-22T10:38:32Z

While the aggressive rate cut was a good start, whether it will prevent the economy from descending ... [+] into recession remain unknown. This article will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve delivered a larger-than-expected half percentage point (0.50%) decrease in short-term interest rates last week. While the rate cut was a virtual certainty, the path forward and whether it will prevent the economy from descending into recession remain unknown. This piece will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, the odds of an economic soft landing should be considered higher than before the move. Though the real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate remains above 2023, there are likely more rate cuts in the pipeline. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Futures pricing assumes another cut to short-term interest rates of at least 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November Fed meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut. The December meeting has expectations identical to those for November. Number Of Rate Cuts Expected In seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended in recession. Still, stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 reacted positively to the outsized rate cut. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed the S&P 500 on the week but are now only 6.6% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high during the week, eclipsing the July 16 high. Stock Market Performance The U.S. economy remains resilient, with the Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP at 2.9%. These estimates provide a real-time estimate of economic growth since quarterly GDP reports are provided with a significant lag. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate Other valuable high-frequency reports are the initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits. These claims have improved lately, but any significant softening in the labor market should be seen here first. Initial Jobless Claims The job market has softened. While the unemployment rate at 4.2% remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some less dire outcomes in the labor market and the economy so far. The employment-to-population ratio is a monthly statistic updated in the monthly jobs report, and so is the unemployment rate. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction. Last week showed a better performance for economically sensitive stocks, bolstering the case that markets also viewed the Fed’s actions as supportive of better odds of avoiding recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Banks tend to underperform the S&P 500 before and often during recessions since their loan losses and profits are inexorably tied to the economy. Bank stocks significantly outperformed last week, adding to the optimistic view of the impacts of the more significant Fed rate cut on the economy. U.S. Banks Relative Performance Finally, the consumer is crucial for the health of the economy. Looking at the relative performance of the consumer discretionary sector can help indicate when the consumer and, by extension, the U.S. economy might be in trouble. The equal-weighted S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is used; otherwise, Amazon.com (AMZN) would dominate the analysis given its massive size in the capitalization-weighted index. Consistent with the other measures shown, consumer discretionary stocks outperformed. Consumer Discretionary Relative Strength Based on the indicators reviewed in this analysis and current economic data, the base case remains a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other, so our typically reliable yield curve and Sahm rule indicators should be viewed more skeptically than usual. The initial reaction to the larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate cut from the Fed has been positive across the soft landing checklist. It indicates that market participants are assigning higher odds of avoiding recession following Chair Powell’s aggressive start to easing monetary policy. If history is any indicator, success in avoiding a recession is no sure thing. Since markets reflect a higher likelihood of a soft landing, investors should expect price declines for stocks and other risk assets if recession probabilities increase. Since the eventual outcome remains unknown, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and consider rebalancing after the robust stock gains. Owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should benefit equity portfolios if the economy and earnings falter. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! What happened? On Monday, Mizuho downgraded Southern Company (NYSE:SO) to Neutral with a $90 price target. *TLDR: Mizuho sees limited catalysts for further outperformance despite a 21% P/E premium. Strong load growth and robust capital plan should support SO’s 5-7% EPS growth rate and maintain a strong balance sheet through 2026. What’s the full story? Mizuho downgraded Southern Company to Neutral, after previously upgrading it in April 2023 when shares were trading at a 4% P/E premium to the group. The firm initially argued that shares could re-rate to a double-digit premium as Vogtle Unit 4 neared completion. However, with shares now trading at a 21% P/E premium to the electric utility group, Mizuho sees few catalysts for further outperformance. Despite moving to the sidelines on SO, Mizuho believes that strong load growth in SO’s service territory, driven by data center demand and reshoring of manufacturing, should make the company’s 5-7% EPS growth rate more durable. The firm also believes that management can maintain a robust capital plan, a strong balance sheet with 17% FFO/Debt, and minimal equity needs of $350 million per year through 2026. Neutral at Mizuho means “The stock’s total return is expected to perform in line with the unweighted, expected total return of the analyst’s industry coverage universe over the next 12 months. “ What happened? On Tuesday, Redburn-Atlantic upgraded Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) to Buy with a $99 price target *TLDR: Redburn-Atlantic highlights Shopify’s innovation, social media integrations, and Shop Pay as key growth factors. The firm is forecasting 29% revenue CAGR and 40% EBIT margin by 2026. What’s the full story? Redburn-Atlantic highlights Shopify’s industry-leading innovation, social media integrations, user-friendly platform, and unique Shop Pay button functionality as key factors positioning it to capitalize on structural growth. The firm’s extensive ecosystem and platform capabilities have cemented Shopify as the ecommerce provider of choice for merchants of all sizes, with significant enterprise merchant wins anticipated in 2025. Redburn-Atlantic upgrades its recommendation on Shopify to Buy, citing the company’s multi-faceted moat characterized by scale, high switching costs, and an impenetrable three-sided network. The firm forecasts a 29% net revenue CAGR from 2023-26 and a 40% EBIT margin by 2026, resulting in projections 24% above 2026 EBIT consensus. The price target is set at $99, based on above-consensus earnings and a fair multiple in line with peers in the internet, fintech, and software sectors. Buy at Redburn-Atlantic means “Redburn Atlantic argues that the stock price will rise by at least 15% over one year. For high beta stocks the hurdle rate may be commensurately higher. “ What happened? On Wednesday, Wolfe Research downgraded ResMed Inc (NYSE:RMD) to Underperform with a $180 price target. *TLDR: Wolfe rates RMD Underperform with a $180 target, citing disruption risks from Lilly’s GLP-1 medication. Analysts see 10% upside and 30%-40% downside risk, projecting mid-single digit growth. What’s the full story? Wolfe analysts rate RMD shares as Underperform with a $180 target price, applying a 20x P/E multiple to NTM EPS of roughly $9. This lower multiple reflects anticipated disruption risks to RMD’s business in 2025-2026 due to Lilly’s potential launch of an obstructive sleep apnea indication for its GLP-1 medication tirzepatide. Wolfe’s total addressable market analysis suggests a 15%-25% long-term impact on the CPAP opportunity, leading to a sustainable growth rate more likely in the mid-single digits rather than high-single digits. The analysts present two comparison sets: HSD med tech growers with a 25x-27.5x P/E and MSD med tech growers with a 15x-20x P/E. They believe RMD’s growth expectations align more with the upper end of the MSD range. A doctor survey projects a negative 6% impact on CPAP prescription volumes, framing the potential shift from HSD to MSD growth. Wolfe sees a 10% upside potential with a 30%-40% downside risk over the next 12-24 months. Underperform at Wolfe means “The security is projected to underperform analyst's industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.” What happened? On Thursday, BTIG upgraded DoorDash Inc (NASDAQ:DASH) to Buy with a $155 price target. *TLDR: BTIG raises estimates for DASH due to near-term strength and long-term growth drivers. Positive EBIT and net income expected in 2H; rideshare-delivery sector shows secular growth. What’s the full story? BTIG has been closely monitoring DoorDash due to a positive category bias, strong execution, and upward pressure on estimates. The analyst highlights three key reasons for raising estimates: ongoing near-term strength and under-appreciated long-term drivers, important milestones with positive EBIT and net income expected in the second half, and the rideshare-delivery sector being a rare area of secular growth in consumer-facing Internet. The analyst emphasizes the desire to increase exposure to DASH relative to more mature categories like eTravel, online dating, and real estate services. BTIG sees significant potential in DASH’s continued growth and milestones, positioning it as a compelling investment opportunity. Buy at BTIG means “A security which is expected to produce a positive total return of 15% or greater over the 12 months following the recommendation. The BUY rating may be maintained as long as it is deemed appropriate, notwithstanding price fluctuations that would cause the target to fall outside of the 15% return. “ What happened? On Friday, B. Riley initiated coverage on Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) at Buy with a $75 price target. *TLDR: B. Riley sees Reddit’s unique platform and early monetization phase driving growth. Attractive risk/reward profile at 31x 2025 EBITDA, with potential for significant leverage. What’s the full story? B. Riley highlights Reddit’s unique value proposition to users, advertisers, and content licensees through its platform, which supports tens of millions of users across over 100,000 communities. This creates a vast and growing repository of curated content. The broker believes Reddit is in the early stages of monetizing its platform through advertising and data licensing, positioning it for healthy top-line growth and margin gains in the coming years. At approximately 31x 2025 estimated EBITDA, B. Riley finds the risk/reward profile attractive, given the prospects for above-industry growth and significant leverage over the next several years. The broker sees Reddit’s potential for continued expansion and profitability as a compelling investment opportunity Buy at B. Riley means “We generally expect “Buy” rated stocks to have an above-average risk-adjusted total return over the next 12 months. We recommend that investors buy the securities at the current valuation."

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: SK Hynix hit by double downgrade; ADI named Top Semis Pick

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! During the week, William Blair analysts have initiated coverage on Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) with an Outperform rating, voicing confidence in the company’s potential for strong earnings per share (EPS) growth and stock price appreciation over the coming years. The firm pointed to several growth drivers for Arm, including “1) higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs) driven by improved monetization and higher value IP; 2) share gains in newer markets like data center; 3) tailwinds from AI driving higher demand for overall compute; and 4) a new upgrade cycle in mobile/PCs.” While Arm’s stock trades at a premium compared to its peers, William Blair believes this is justified by the company’s robust growth outlook, which is expected to become clearer in the financial forecasts for 2026 and 2027. Their discounted cash flow analysis indicates around 35% upside potential for Arm’s shares, supported by sustained revenue growth and increasing profitability over the next decade. In a separate note, William Blair also assigned an Outperform rating to Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), noting the company's strategic expansion into software as a way to buffer against the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. The firm believes that the chipmaker is positioned for continued growth, driven by AI-related demand in networking and custom chip segments, along with the shift to subscription-based models in its VMware (NYSE:VMW) division. Analysts highlighted that nearly two-thirds of VMware customers have transitioned to subscriptions, a significant rise from the 30% seen prior to the acquisition. They also noted that AVGO is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 26x and an enterprise value to free cash flow ratio of 22x based on their 2025 projections, slightly below the median of its peers. “We see room for multiple expansion as the sustainability of growth in networking, customer AI chips, and software becomes clearer,” the note states. Shares of SK Hynix (KS:000660) dropped on Thursday following a double downgrade from Morgan Stanley, with analysts shifting their rating from Overweight to Underweight. In a note, analysts remarked that "the sun is still shining" for the company at the moment. They predict 2024 will be another strong year for SK Hynix, driven by increasing DRAM prices heading into the fourth quarter, which should lead to "exceptional near-term earnings." However, the outlook beyond the fourth quarter appears less favorable. While the long-term potential for DRAM, particularly due to AI-driven demand from data centers, is still promising, the firm noted that cyclical shortages are coming to an end. “Looking past 4Q24, we see sustained risks to the top line and EPS as growth slows, pricing falls, and rising competition in high-bandwith memory (HBM) challenges sustainable long-term margins,” the analysts added. In addition to downgrading the stock, Morgan Stanley also cut its price target for SK Hynix by more than half, lowering it from 260,000 to 120,000 Korean won. In a research note released Tuesday, Citi analysts named Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) as their new top pick in the semiconductor sector. The decision follows Citi's update to its semiconductor stock ranking table, which included a price target adjustment for Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and an upgrade of Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). The firm maintains a positive outlook on the semiconductor industry as a whole. Citi highlighted ADI's lower downside risk in the automotive sector compared to other analog semiconductor makers, particularly following the company’s recent earnings report. This reduced risk, according to Citi, makes ADI well-positioned amid ongoing market uncertainties, leading the firm to rank it at the top of its semiconductor stock table. "ADI is our top pick," Citi analysts stated, adding that they see "lower downside risk in Autos versus other analog names given they have just announced earnings." Broadcom and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), both key players in the AI sector, remain in Citi's second and third spots, respectively. Wedbush analysts said that they believe the AI revolution trade has gained momentum following the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut, signaling a favorable environment for Big Tech and AI stocks. Wedbush views this aggressive rate cut, alongside a dovish dot plot extending into 2025, as creating a "very bullish backdrop" for the tech sector. The Fed’s move marks a momentous shift, as many investors had been waiting for this signal to fully engage with tech growth stocks leading into 2025. The firm pointed out that the broader technology sector has remained resilient, with recent earnings reports, such as those from Oracle, indicating that the AI revolution is entering its software and application phase. Recent observations from Asia suggest the tech supply chain is preparing for significant expansion, spurred by an expected $1 trillion in AI capital expenditures in the coming years. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains at the forefront of this revolution, with its GPUs being described by Wedbush as the "new oil and gold" of the IT industry. With the Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting cycle now underway and AI tech spending beginning to accelerate, Wedbush analysts continue to hold a bullish outlook for tech stocks, expecting further gains into 2025. Meanwhile, analysts at Melius Research have upgraded Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) from Hold to Buy, setting a price target of $210. They emphasize that Oracle founder Larry Ellison and CEO Safra Catz are not only leveraging their influence but also taking a more strategic approach with partnerships, positioning Oracle’s AI-first Cloud as a key growth driver. Ellison’s strong connections in the tech world, including access to GPUs and agreements with Cloud CEOs, along with his friendship with customer Elon Musk, have played a role, Melius’s team notes. While Oracle’s stock is up 54% year-to-date, the firm’s analysts believe this upgrade might not be late, suggesting the stock could be in the middle of a larger move. "We see close to $8.50 in terms of an EPS run rate within 2 years—and with our biggest worries muted—we find it hard not to put a 25x multiple on a company set to grow faster than Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)," they said.

(NASDAQ: CRWD), DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC), and Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV) Class Period: February 22, 2024 - July 8, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants (1) grossly overstated their ability to forecast the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior products, which forecasting ability was far less capable and effective than Defendants had led investors and analysts to believe; (2) overstated the financial prospects of SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE, and thus overstated the Company's anticipated revenue and other financial metrics; (3) knew or recklessly disregarded that because of the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior's products, Indivior was unlikely to meet its own previously issued and repeatedly reaffirmed FY 2024 net revenue guidance, including its FY 2024 net revenue guidance for SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE; (4) knew or recklessly disregarded that Indivior was at a significant risk of, and/or was likely to, cease all sales and marketing activities related to PERSERIS; and (5) knew or recklessly disregarded that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

(NASDAQ: CRWD) Class Period: November 29, 2023 - July 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit.

While touting its ongoing success in implementing that integration, DXC repeatedly stressed its commitment to reducing the Company’s restructuring and transaction, separation, and integration (“TSI”) costs in order to increase its free cashflow and “unleash [its] true earnings power.” In truth, Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the Company was only able to reduce its restructuring and TSI costs by limiting its integration efforts. The complaint alleges that on August 3, 2022, DXC reported disappointing first quarter results, despite having reiterated its guidance just six weeks prior. DXC blamed its poor performance on the fact that its “cost optimization efforts have moved at a slower pace than anticipated.” These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline by 17%, from $31.52 per share to $26.15 per share. Then, on May 16, 2024, DXC’s CEO admitted that “the previous restructurings did not set a real, clean, solid, fully integrated baseline for profitable growth” because the systems that were acquired over time were “never integrated, never deduped,” and admitted that the Company was “not [a] fully functional organization.” DXC also announced it would need to spend an additional $250 million to achieve the restructuring and integration process it falsely claimed to have been successfully implementing during the Class Period. These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline nearly 17%, from $19.88 per share to $16.52 per share.

(NASDAQ: FIVE) Class Period: December 1, 2022 - July 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided investors with false and/or materially misleading information about Five Below’s financial strength and operations, including its outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024. This information included Five Below’s statement that net sales are expected to be in the range of $826 million to $846 million based on opening approximately 55 to 60 new stores in the first quarter. Further, Five Below claimed that net sales for the full year are expected to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $4.07 billion based on opening between 225 and 235 new stores. Investors discovered that these statements were false and/or materially misleading when, on June 5, 2024, Five Below announced disappointing first quarter 2024 sales result and cut its full year 2024 guidance stating, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $3.79 billion to $3.87 billion based on opening approximately 230 new stores.” At the same time, Five Below claimed that for the second quarter, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $830 million to $850 million based on opening approximately 60 new stores.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
