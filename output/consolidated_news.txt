Title: Early Retirement With Index Funds: How This Simple Strategy Could Change Your Financial Future

Many dream of retiring early, but achieving that goal doesn't require high-priced financial advisors or complex investment strategies. Low-cost index funds have emerged as a powerful tool in pursuing financial independence, offering a straightforward path that combines simplicity, diversification, and a proven track record of superior performance. Index funds are investments that mirror specific market indexes, such as the S&P 500 or the total stock market. Think of them as buying a slice of the entire market rather than trying to pick individual winning stocks. So when you invest in an S&P 500 index mutual or exchange-traded fund, you're gaining exposure to America's 500 largest companies, from Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola Co. (KO). The index approach began in the 1970s when John Bogle launched the first index fund (the Vanguard 500 Index Fund). Critics initially called it "un-American" and "a sure path to mediocrity." Starting with just $11 million in assets, the fund struggled initially. However, investors soon caught on, and index funds grew dramatically. As of late 2025, the Vanguard 500 Fund has $1.5 trillion in assets under management. As you can see above, few actively managed funds have beat index funds over the last few decades. Some say the success of index funds rests on a fundamental principle known as the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), which argues that stock prices reflect all publicly available information about companies, making it extremely difficult for any individual investor to consistently identify mispriced stocks and beat the market. Market efficiency arises from the immense scale of modern financial markets, where millions of participants simultaneously analyze data and trade stocks. When new information emerges, their collective trading quickly drives prices to reflect that information in a process known as "price discovery." To regularly beat the market, an active manager would need to analyze information much faster and make better judgments than this vast network of competitors, a task that becomes mathematically improbable over long periods and which could explain the persistent underperformance of active funds. The cost advantage of index funds creates an additional tail wind that can really push returns upward. A $10,000 investment earning an annualized 7% average return over 30 years would grow to $73,191 with a low-cost index fund charging 0.14% annually, but only to $57,435 with a higher-cost fund charging 1.0% annually. The difference of $15,756 represents a 27.4% cut in your returns only from the 0.86% difference in annual fees—something seemingly small that adds up dramatically over time. Dollar-cost averaging is where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. This approach offers three key advantages: "Systematically buying investments incrementally over time is a proven method to a successful long-term outcome because it helps investors ignore the noise of financial news and the folly of attempting to time the market," says David Tenerelli, a certified financial planner at Values Added Financial. "It takes discipline to continue to buy investments during a market downturn, but a shift in mindset can help—rather than fearing financial loss, an investor can reframe as buying stocks 'on sale.'" The combination of market-matching returns, minimal fees, and the power of compounding make index funds historically one of the most reliable paths to building wealth. However, success requires consistent, disciplined contributions and a long enough time horizon.

Title: Billionaire David Tepper Pours $411,000,000 Into Contrarian Asset After Dumping Exposure To Tech, Health and AI Stocks

A highly successful and closely watched billionaire is making major changes to his hedge fund’s portfolio. A new SEC filing shows the founder and president of Appaloosa Management, David Tepper, just sold UnitedHealth (UNH), Intel (INTC), Alibaba (BABA), Vistra (VST) and Micron (MU). Tepper slashed UNH by 92%, exited INTC entirely, trimmed BABA by 9%, cut VST by 31% and reduced MU by 39% in Q3 of 2025. Meanwhile, in a bold contrarian pivot, Tepper poured $411 million into Whirlpool (WHR), boosting shares from 266,000 to 5.5 million. The appliance giant now ranks third in Appaloosa’s $7.38 billion portfolio at 5.85%. Tepper also added stakes in old-economy names like Goodyear Tire (GT) and regional banks such as Truist (TFC) and Western Alliance (WAL). The moves reflect Tepper’s opportunistic style, betting on undervalued cyclicals amid tech pullbacks. The firm’s portfolio value grew 14% quarter-over-quarter, and its top holdings remain Alibaba (BABA) at 15.6%, Amazon (AMZN) at 7.4%, and Nvidia (NVDA) at 4.8%.

Title: Top 10 crypto fundraising rounds in 2025 — and what they mean for 2026
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/top-10-crypto-fundraising-rounds-in-2025/
Time Published: 2026-01-03T06:00:00Z

About us Copy link Fundraising by crypto businesses reached over $25 billion in 2025, shattering analysts’ expectations that companies would raise just north of $18 billion. The top 10 raises alone brought in over $10 billion, DefiLlama data shows. Leading investors this year include not only tech-centric firms like Paradigm and Sequoia Capital, but also white-shoe stalwarts BlackRock, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs. The blockbuster deals underscore the convergence between crypto and traditional financial institutions, according to Charles Chong, VP of strategy at crypto investment firm BlockSpaceForce. “The line between fintech, TradFi, and crypto will continue to blur,” Chong told DL News. “Blockchain rails will increasingly sit in the background, improving settlement, custody, and programmability, while most crypto-specific complexity is abstracted away from end users,” Chong said. In the converging environment, the main dynamic is companies with a big client base splurging to buy infrastructure firms, regardless of whether they started as fintech or crypto, he said. “Stablecoins and tokenised assets will keep growing because they solve obvious problems for banks, funds, and corporations,” he said. Here are the top 10 biggest raises in 2025. In March, crypto exchange Binance raised $2 billion in a strategic round led by Abu Dhabi-based fund MGX. The raise is the largest single investment in crypto history and marks a key milestone in Binance’s post-regulatory transformation, as it doubles down on institutional services and compliance infrastructure. In October, US President Donald Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the former Binance CEO who served a four-month prison sentence in 2024 after pleading guilty to violating US laws by failing to do enough to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court filings. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told DL News that Zhao was “prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency.” In October, Prediction platform Polymarket locked in a $2 billion strategic raise led by the New York Stock Exchange’s parent company ICE. “Our investment blends ICE [with] a forward-thinking, revolutionary company pioneering change within the decentralised finance space,” said Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE CEO. The $2 billion dollar investment certainly raised a few eyebrows, but Michael Blaugrund, vice president of strategic initiatives at Intercontinental Exchange, said in November that Zohran Mamdani’s New York City mayoral election win vindicated the sale. Bettors had given Mamdani overwhelming odds to win. “I was so nervous,” Blaugrund said at an event. “Because regardless of where my politics are, if Mamdani didn’t win, we would have overpaid for Polymarket.” In June, Stablecoin issuer Circle raised $1.1 billion in its August public offering in one of the most high-profile crypto raises on Wall Street. Now trading at just over 150% above IPO price, Circle is trying to position as critical dollar infrastructure for digital payments by focusing on global rollout, public sector partnerships, and expanding its compliance-based treasury rails. The raise underscores how stablecoins are entering Wall Street. In August, Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish debuted on public markets raising $1.1 billion. Its automated market maker-style trading model and regulated-first positioning made it attractive to institutional investors seeking exchange exposure with minimal counterparty risk. The firm said it will use the funds to grow in Asia and Europe while doubling down on proprietary trading and data services. It currently trades near $39 per share at time of reporting, or just slightly above its IPO price. In December, betting platform Kalshi announced it closed a $1 billion Series E led by Paradigm and a16z. The Polymarket rival, focused on real-world event contracts, said it aims to become the Nasdaq analogy of prediction markets. As demand for hedging against macroeconomic, weather, and politics grows, Kalshi is launching hundreds of new tradable events and lobbying for further regulatory clarity. In September, blockchain lender Figure Technology raised just over $787 million in an IPO. Legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office alone invested $50 million, Reuters reported. Built on the Provenance Blockchain, the firm tokenises home equity loans and other credit instruments. Institutional investors see Figure as a gateway to real-world asset tokenisation. In September, Kraken pulled in $600 million in a pre-IPO round to prepare for a 2026 public offering. Previous report had stated that the crypto exchange had raised a $500 million round, but the company only confirmed the actual number in November as it not only officially announced plans to go public in 2026, but that it had also secured another $200 million in a strategic investment from Citadel Securities at a $20 billion valuation. The raise is “a milestone that reflects years of work, discipline, and conviction,” co-CEO Arjun Sethi said on LinkedIn. “I am proud of our team and grateful for the partners who chose to join us. In July, memecoin launchpad Pump.fun stunned markets with a $500 million initial coin offering. The platform lets users mint new tokens instantly. Often dismissed as retail froth, Pump.fun’s raise shows investor appetite for high-risk, high-speed protocols remains relevant. The team has said it is investing in security upgrades and social trading features. In October, Stripe-incubated layer 1 blockchain Tempo raised $500 million to build a high-speed payments chain for USDC and USDT. Tempo targets global payroll and remittances with low-latency infrastructure. In December, Tempo released its first public test network. Tempo has lured several well-respected crypto researchers, executives, and software engineers, such as former Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist, former Optimism Labs CEO Liam Horne, and Rice University Professor Mallesh Pai. In September, fintech-as-a-service firm Rapyd closed a $500 million Series F round backed by BlackRock and Fidelity. Known for powering crypto-fiat APIs and stablecoin rails, Rapyd says it is now working on a multibillion-dollar acquisition strategy. It’s become critical middleware for businesses bridging traditional finance and DeFi.

Title: XRP Faces Strong Social Discontent—Is A 50% Bullish Reversal Just Around The Corner?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As 2026 begins, XRP is starting the year on a bearish note, with investor sentiment plummeting to levels of extreme fear. Despite these challenging conditions, analysts are suggesting that this negativity may set the stage for a significant bullish reversal, drawing parallels to historical trends. Reports indicate that periods of extreme sentiment have often preceded XRP rallies with impressive gains, at times exceeding 1,000%. Data from Santiment indicates that bearish mentions of XRP are now running 20-30% higher than the subdued averages seen in November. This deepening negativity, coupled with XRP stabilizing between $1.8 and $1.9 mark, highlights “a classic market divergence”: sentiment continues to worsen while prices consolidate, suggesting that emotional capitulation is occurring faster than any fundamental deterioration. Beneath this wave of retail fear, however, institutional behavior paints a more positive picture. Spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded inflows of approximately $424 million in December alone, making them the best-performing crypto ETF product. This contrast between extreme retail sentiment—currently at an extreme fear level of 24—and substantial institutional accumulation, which stands at around $1.3 billion over the past 50 days, often precedes market reversals more reliably than sentiment readings alone indicate. For XRP, the current setup combines extreme fear readings with a social sentiment significantly above baseline levels, alongside price consolidation, creating a historical pattern that has led to substantial rallies multiple times since 2020. For instance, back in the 2020-2021 cycle, XRP dropped to $0.17 amid the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit, followed by a 1,053% increase to $1.96 over just four months. Today’s scenario mirrors this past occurrence. With institutional accumulation diverging sharply from retail capitulation, historical data suggests that this combination yields a 70-75% chance of a bullish reversal within the next two to eight weeks. Current trading conditions for XRP sit at approximately $1.90, with the Fear & Greed Index at 24. This setup creates three potential scenarios. In the most favorable bullish scenario, the Trump administration could announce clear pro-crypto regulatory policies in the first quarter of the year, BlackRock might file an XRP ETF application, or the adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could rapidly scale above $2-3 billion. Historically, when the Fear & Greed Index climbs from 24 into neutral territory (between 50 and 60), XRP often rallies between 30-50%, setting targets between $2.44 and $2.82. If bullish momentum continues into mild greed (70+), XRP could reach the $3.00-$3.20 range. In a more neutral scenario, sentiment may gradually normalize without dramatic catalysts, with ETF inflows continuing to average between $200-300 million monthly. As RLUSD organically grows through existing partnerships, fears could naturally subside over a span of six to eight weeks. As the Fear & Greed Index rises from 24 to the 45-55 range, XRP has typically appreciated between 15-25%, targeting between $2.16 and $2.35. If the support at $1.85 holds through January, and trading volume expands above $1.98, the price could extend toward $2.40-$2.50. In a bearish outcome, sentiment could linger in extreme fear (below 30) for over eight weeks without relief. A decisive break below $1.85 on substantial volume would see XRP testing support levels around $1.65-$1.70. The altcoin has surged by over 6% in the past 24 hours towards $1.98 amid a broader recovery in the crypto market.

HEADLINES: Trump declares U.S. will "run" Venezuela temporarily, threatens those who oppose (Video)Following a public pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, on Saturday a military assault ordered by President Donald Trump captured Maduro and his wife, who were then taken to the United States to face narco-terrorism, drug trafficking and weapons charges. Venezuela's vice president denounced the operation and called it illegal. Trump said the U.S. would "run the country" until there's a judicious transition, and warned of more attacks if Venezuela does not comply. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin outlines the operation. HEADLINES: In Venezuela, uncertainty in the wake of Maduro's removal (Video)It's not the first time the United States has used force to remove a Latin American strongman from power. But the Trump administration's operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro now leaves that country's future shrouded in uncertainty – with President Trump saying the U.S. may "run" Venezuela, and questions over whether the opposition can take over. Lee Cowan talks with author William Neuman and professor Oscar Perez about Washington's next steps as it takes control of a nation of nearly 30 million people.

Title: Bitcoin treasury slump deepens as 40% trade at discount: ‘It’s an abomination’
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/bitcoin-treasury-blues-mount-as-40-percent-trade-at-discount/
Time Published: 2026-01-02T21:26:54Z
Full Content:
About us Copy link The trend that became the biggest boom of 2025 is starting the new year as a bust. At least 37 of the top 100 Bitcoin treasury companies now trade at discounts to their net asset value, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. That means nearly 40% of major treasuries are worth less than the Bitcoin they hold. “The initial hype is over,” Brian Huang, co-founder of investment platform Glider, told DL News. Indeed, the premium era has ended. For the first three-quarters of 2025, treasury companies enjoyed significant premiums on their holdings. That allowed them to issue new stock above their Bitcoin value, use the proceeds to buy more coins, and repeat the cycle — all without diluting shareholders. Scores of companies, many of them without any previous connection to crypto, rushed to emulate the trade. The boom meant nearly 200 public companies now collectively hold over 1 million Bitcoin worth around $96 billion. But that playbook only works when companies’ equity trades at a premium to the crypto on their balance sheets. Strategy, the sector’s pioneer, traded at more than double its Bitcoin value last year. Today it offers a 17% discount. The entire trade began to slump in October. Ultimately, just one Bitcoin treasury company, France’s The Blockchain Group, outperformed the 16% the S&P 500 returned to investors in 2025, according to a December report from BitcoinTreasuries.net. Every other treasury underperformed the bellwether S&P 500, and 60% of Bitcoin treasuries spent more on their Bitcoin than it’s now worth. For macro analyst Alex Kruger, the Bitcoin treasury trade ominously reminds him of a situation that Bitcoin dealt with exactly five years ago. “When it comes to analogies across cycles and Bitcoin Treasury companies, June 2025 is analogous to December 2020 and the Bitcoin Grayscale trade,” Kruger told DL News. In 2020, Grayscale traded at a 40% premium to its Bitcoin holdings, meaning investors paid $1.40 for every $1 of Bitcoin the trust held because it was the only way institutions could get regulated Bitcoin exposure. But then came Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Investors could get Bitcoin exposure easily on their BlackRock or Fidelity account, collapsing Grayscale’s appeal — and premium. Eventually, Grayscale’s product traded at a 50% discount, pinning down investors who were forced to sell at massive losses. The 37 Bitcoin treasury companies trading below NAV range from major players like Strategy and Twenty One Capital — two of the top five treasuries, which each have a 17% discount to their Bitcoin holdings — to smaller firms like Sweden-based H100 Group, which trades at a 32% discount, and Vanadi Coffee, which is valued by investors at a 61% discount to its Bitcoin holdings. Another five to six companies hover precariously close to 1.0x, including Brazil-based OranjeBTC at parity. Any modest equity drawdown could push them below NAV, and turn them into food for giants. Kruger reckons consolidation is on its way, as failed treasuries become acquisition targets. In September, Bitcoin treasury Strive purchased Semler Scientific in an all-stock transaction. Other treasury figures predict a similar scenario playing out. Katherine Dowling, president of Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, said the strongest digital asset treasuries that survive 2025’s year-end collapse will become even bigger — by acquiring the weak. “Bitcoin DATs will push through this current noise as well. We will also likely see some DAT M&A opportunistic activity,” Dowling previously told DL News. Companies trading below 1.0x mNAV cannot issue stock to buy more Bitcoin because doing so destroys shareholder value. Let’s say a treasury holds $100 million in Bitcoin but trades at a 30% discount, so its market cap is $70 million. If it issues $10 million in new shares to buy Bitcoin, shareholders now own $110 million in Bitcoin but the market cap only rises to $77 million. Shareholders got diluted for nothing. This dynamic destroys the entire treasury playbook, ending access to capital markets, the allegedly endless Bitcoin purchases, and the potential for an expanding premium. Instead, the scheme turns into no more than holding and hoping. “The model is an abomination,” said Kruger. Pedro Solimano is DL News’ Buenos Aires-based markets correspondent. Got a tip?

Your generous monthly contribution— or whatever you can give—will help secure our future. Cecilia Lallmann Cecilia Lallmann Leave your feedback Maybe your resolution for 2026 is to pay down debt, start your retirement savings, or save for a big ticket item. Maybe you need help with personal finance but don't know where to start. Either way, prioritizing your goals for the New Year comes down to understanding what you value the most, Kumiko Love, an accredited financial counselor and author of "My Money, My Way," told PBS News. That's because, in "the world of finance, everything is a trade off," Love said. WATCH: Should you use a buy now, pay later loan? Here's what to know Of the 30% of Americans who say they make at least one resolution, 61% say they are focused on money or finances, according to Pew Research. And a majority of Americans – 87% – say they accomplish at least some of their annual resolutions. To Love, mapping out small wins along the way can help you stay the course. "What we need to be doing is celebrating all the consistent habits and actions and mindset that we're doing to get us there," Love said. "The honest truth is we live more in our day-to-day than at our end results." To help you set yourself up for financial success this year, PBS News asked experts for tips on reaching different financial goals. Fear around your money "most of the time comes from the unknown," Love said. "You're not scared of looking at your money. You're actually nervous and stressed out because you have no idea what's going on with your money," echoed Tori Dunlap, a self-taught money and career expert who founded the financial education platform Her First 100K. "We can't make changes unless we actually know what's going on, unless we know where our money's going." "Paying off debt is not an action, it's a change of lifestyle." When you sit down to look at the numbers, "rewire all of that shame and the fear and the guilt you feel," suggested Dunlap, author of "Financial Feminist. The first step to that is "looking at your money in the most neutral way possible and just figuring out, 'OK, what am I gonna do to fix the things that aren't working and continue doing the things that are?'" There are also resources for people who need support. "The most important thing in this day and time is that if you feel overwhelmed, if you feel burdened, that you reach out and say, 'I need help,'" said Michelle Singletary, personal finance columnist at The Washington Post. She suggests looking into personal finance classes or community programs, or finding an accountability partner. "Maybe there's somebody in your life who's really good with money" who you can ask to help you on your personal finance journey, Singletary said. Love wants people to understand that "paying off debt is not an action, it's a change of lifestyle." She said if you don't learn the healthy habits to stay out of debt, "you can pay off debt but go right back into debt again." So the first step of what she calls a "debt payoff journey" is to understand "why you're in debt in the first place." "This is not a blame game," Love said. "This is simply understanding how you got here so you can set better management and healthy habits to maybe correct some of those things and or make different choices." WATCH: Why it's getting harder to find a new car under $25,000 High-interest debt should be the first kind you should tackle. "Credit card debt always is going to have a high interest rate. That's probably the debt you need to work to eliminate first before you worry about your lesser interest debt," Dunlap said. If you have multiple credit cards with different interest rates, start with the one with the highest interest rate. Dunlap also suggests "looking "into a personal loan to help consolidate your debt, especially if you have a lot of debt at a higher interest rate and it's not going down." "The thing with credit cards is that the interest compounds. It's very high and it compounds every day," Dunlap told PBS News. "So, every day you spend in debt, it gets more expensive. Personal loans allow you to typically take out a loan at a lower interest rate with one single monthly payment that isn't going to compound every day." The personal loan route to pay off high-interest credit card debt can be "a nice reset for your money." Dunlap said the strategy for paying off your student loan debt depends on what kind of loans they are and what the interest rate is. If you have multiple sources of debt, federal student loans can be your last priority since there are other options for repayment, Love said. You may qualify for an income-based repayment plan that could help give you "some breathing room" to focus on whatever debt is most eating into your cash flow and destroying your budget, she added. Dunlap shared what she calls the "7 to 8% rule." If the interest rate on your student loan debt is more than 7 to 8%, then it costs you more money to be in debt, so you should pay it off faster. Put extra money into the principle so your interest is calculated off of a smaller balance. If the interest rate is less than that, Dunlap recommends sticking with monthly payments and focusing on investing any extra income instead. If you have private student loans at a high interest rate, Dunlap said it might be worth refinancing, but she said "do not take your federal loans private." "That takes you out of potential student loan forgiveness in the future," Dunlap said, and won't allow you to get on an income-based repayment plan. "Investing should not be sexy," Dunlap said. "It should be safe, consistent, and over a long period of time." She said day trading or picking "a hot stock" is very risky. The first place to start when investing is using your retirement account to its full advantage, both Dunlap and Love said. "Investing should not be sexy." "People don't understand that retirement accounts like a 401k or an IRA are investing accounts and they're tax advantaged, meaning that the government is incentivizing you to save for your retirement by offering you tax breaks," Dunlap said. Plus, a lot of employer sponsored plans offer a match as part of your benefits package, Love said. "It's like free money" you can use to invest. But, Dunlap said to remember to choose your investments. Otherwise, you'll spend "years in what I call financial purgatory," Dunlap said. Dunlap recommends " something like an index fund, which is a group of stocks" that is "well diversified." Love said if you want more specific advice, you'll typically "have access to the financial advisor that is managing" your retirement account on whatever platform you use. "If you have questions, reach out to them. That's what they're there for," Love said Love stressed that while she is an accredited financial counselor, she is not a fiduciary. So her advice shouldn't take the place of recommendations from an adviser with specific information about your assets. But there are three steps that come to mind for how you could begin "upping your retirement game." First, "start with your [employer] match." Then, if you want to go above and beyond, "I would move to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your tax bracket and where you're gonna be in retirement." And then "I [would] look at something called a health savings account," where individuals can set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified medical expenses. Love recommends looking into an HSA because it's a triple tax-advantage account, since you can contribute to it before taxes, earn interest on the account tax-free, and withdrawals are not taxed as long as they're used for qualifying medical expenses. Since the funds don't expire and continue to roll over year after year, "it turns into quite a retirement account when you become of age for retirement." Dunlap said if you are nearing retirement, you can contribute more money through a "catch-up contribution," which varies based on the account. She recommends looking into what type of retirement account you currently have and what the catch-up contribution is if you're looking to save more as you get closer to retirement age. Before you think about the financial part of homeownership, the first question you should ask yourself is "is this something you want to do or just something that you were told to do?'" Dunlap said "Renting is not throwing away money. You are paying a fee to live in a place and also a convenience fee where somebody else is gonna handle any problems that come up," Dunlap said. She said homeownership comes with many more expenses than just the down payment and monthly mortgage, and you should ask yourself if you're ready to pay for everything that could come up. READ MORE: Is the 30% rule for rent still relevant? Here's what experts think Some expenses to consider include property taxes, emergency repairs, possibly a homeowners association fee and property insurance. So, "the second question is, can I afford to do this?" Dunlap said. If the answer is yes, Love said you need to determine how much to save, which "starts with understanding what you want to buy." "Until you know how much house you can afford and what you want, it's really hard to start the planning process," Love said. Love said some of the questions to ask yourself when determining your budget include: "Are you buying a fixer upper? Are you buying something that you're going to only live in temporarily for a short amount of time under five years? Are you buying your forever home? How big do you want it? Do you still want to extend your family? Because then you have to think if it's going to be your forever home, you better make sure it's big enough." Dunlap suggested using a high-yield savings account to use as a place to save the money you will use for a down payment, and to automate contributions so it's easier to meet your monthly goal. If you want to avoid paying for private mortgage insurance, the easiest way to do this is by having 20% of the home price for the down payment. If you're like the 80% of buyers who financed their home purchase in 2024, you will want to think about how to improve your credit score to get a better mortgage interest rate, Dunlap said. And don't forget about an emergency fund, Love said. You can also use the questions you asked yourself at the beginning to determine how much to save for house maintenance. As soon as you know an estimated total for the purchase, you can start a sinking fund, where you save a small amount from each paycheck for a planned expense. This should be separate from your emergency fund, which should only be used for unplanned expenses. Both Dunlap and Love say the easiest way to determine your monthly savings goal is to take the amount and divide it by however many months you have to save. If you do this and the amount is unrealistic, Dunlap said, you should pick a different destination, a more affordable item or give yourself more time to save, if you can move the date. In 2025, more than 1.1 million people in the U.S. were laid off, according to the career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. When trying to make up for lost income, Love said, "lean in on the skills that you possess" and "get on places like Upwork where you can work for yourself." You may feel like you are overqualified to drive for Uber, but you could be surprised and make way more than you thought you could, Love said. Places like Upwork can also connect you with temporary gigs that match your skillset. Dunlap said a high-yield savings account can come in handy during this time. Even small contributions could return $20 to 40 a month, compared to the few dollars you'd get in annual interest with a traditional account. It's also a good time to make a sustainable budget. Like a car gas gauge, "budgets tell you how far you can get," Dunlap said. "Knowing what's going in and going out, and allowing your budget to adjust accordingly is one of the ways we get control during a very uncontrollable situation." Also, "remind yourself that this season is temporary," Love said, and give yourself grace. More than half of the U.S. workforce in 2024 were paid hourly rates, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . These workers tend to have less predictable paychecks compared to salaried workers. If your income fluctuates, the first step is to know the minimum amount of money you need to make each month to meet the basics. (Love calls this a "bare bones budget"; for Dunlap, it's the "ramen noodle number.") Start with a revolving checking or savings account, where you'll deposit your checks or tips. "Pay yourself" your bare bones budget from this account to cover your monthly expenses. If there is extra money left, leave it in the revolving account so you can make up for expenses when you don't meet your bare bones budget in other months. Love recommends having at least one month of bare bones expenses in the revolving account. Keeping the baseline in the account can help stabilize your cash flow. Gradually, "you can start giving yourself more for more wants" as you continue to build up this account, Love said. If you make more money than you expect, Dunlap suggests going through a "financial priority list" for that extra income. "Contribute to your emergency fund," Dunlap said. If you already have three to six months of living expenses tucked away, pay off credit card debt and then "contribute more to your retirement accounts," Dunlap said.

Title: Be warned: big tech elitism beyond dot-com bubble peak

Get the FREE App Get the FREE App Australian investors continue to pile into US stocks, chasing outsized returns and their own piece of the artificial intelligence boom. Yet the era of tech giant dominance and a whirlpool of circular investment deals could mean a riskier bet than many realise. The popularity of funds linked to Wall Street's S&P500 index has soared and it's not hard to see why: returns over the past three years are more than 78 per cent compared to about 24 per cent for the local S&P/ASX200. But with just a handful of outsized companies and AI speculation driving broader market growth in 2025, a fund of 500 stocks might be less diversified than most of us think. And therein lies the rub. The so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks of Apple, Nvidia, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, Meta and Microsoft make up more than a third of the S&P500 index's value, according to IG market analyst Tony Sycamore. "Then if you throw in Netflix and Broadcom, you're getting that dominance rising to closer to 45 per cent," he tells AAP. "Almost half the market cap is covered by nine stocks." By comparison, during the peak that preceded the dot-com crash in 2000, the six top tech companies accounted for roughly 15 per cent of the top 500 US stocks. There are many differences from the dot-com era, namely that most of the magnificent seven have pre-existing businesses that don't depend on AI. However the amount of money flowing into its research is eye-watering. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet alone spent an estimated $US350 billion ($A520 billion) in 2025 on AI research and infrastructure, including the data centres required to power the technology's large language models. "There's valid concern around the Mag Seven; they don't seem to have the revenue to offset these heavy debt loads," Mr Sycamore says. "The cash burn for them is extraordinary and earnings have started to slow." The circular flow of funds between the tech juggernauts and into deals with pre-revenue companies like ChatGPT creator Open AI is also a worry despite headlines and agreements delivering vertigo-inducing stock price jumps. "The market is waking up to the fact that those announcements look great on the surface but underneath they're deeply concerning, artificial and prone to unravelling quickly," Mr Sycamore adds. "That is part of the reason why we have seen these tech stocks pull back." OpenAI, potentially the world's most valuable private company with an estimated market capitalisation of $US700 billion, intends spending $US1.4 trillion on AI infrastructure despite not expecting a profit until 2030. The gap has left many wondering where the money will come from. Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston has never seen a case study similar. "There's circular deals going off left, right and centre: Broadcom, AMD ... Nvidia has $US100 billion investment in OpenAI" he says. "And it's really all premised on the idea that, at some stage, OpenAI will be able to completely monetise their offering." But despite launching the first generative AI large language model ChatGPT in June 2018, which is now in its fifth iteration, competition in AI is white-hot. "When you've got so many of them coming up, backed by some massive players that are already seen as better alternatives, if OpenAI monetises at the wrong cost structure then it becomes a major issue," Mr Weston says. With this in mind, Pepperstone is watching Softbank, a Japanese investment holding group riding an "all-in" bet on OpenAI to generate $US22.5 billion funding via loans and the sale of Nvidia and T-Mobile stocks. As one of the biggest private tech deals in history, Softbank's play is seen as a barometer for the AI leader which, as a private concern, can't be accurately valued. Bank of America data points to roughly 94 per cent of tech profits being poured into AI spending, according to InvestorsObserver finance analyst Sam Bourgi. "These companies are spending almost all the money they earn," he says. "Just in September and October, big tech borrowed $75 billion specifically for AI data centres - more than double their normal annual borrowing." Notably, shares in the Tokyo-headquartered conglomerate plummeted more than 40 per cent in October. The implications of tech concentration for Australians invested in S&P500 index funds is straightforward, Mr Bourgi says. "You own a slice of all this risk and your index's performance now depends heavily on whether these six companies' AI bets work out. "If they succeed and AI becomes hugely profitable over the next few years, your index fund will likely perform well. "If they don't and this turns out to be another bubble like 2000, your index fund could suffer significant losses." A 30 per cent drift in AI stocks could mean a 10-15 per cent decline in an S&P500 index fund, which would leave investors in a tricky spot. "You might not see gains for years if the bubble deflates like in 2000," Mr Bourgi says.

By Lili Pike, Bloomberg The world is now moving into the latter half of a critical decade to fight climate change. Scientists have warned that nations need to cut carbon emissions nearly 50% by 2030 to stave off 1.5C temperature rise. The world is woefully off track to meet those targets and risks further backsliding, even as there are some surprising sources of progress. In the US, those tensions are on full display. The future of the energy transition is being shaped by President Donald Trump’s climate policy rollbacks that favor fossil fuels — but also the life support for renewables and batteries paradoxically coming from data center power demand. China’s role as the world’s biggest emitter and hub for green tech are also affecting efforts to curb carbon pollution. This year, the country will set a new plan laying out how climate fits with its economic ambitions, while its booming clean tech sector is expected to help more developing countries adopt renewable energy and electric vehicles. Here are 14 themes Bloomberg News writers are keeping tabs on in 2026. Climate clues in China’s new economic blueprint When Chinese officials gather in March for annual legislative meetings, they will approve the country’s next five-year plan. Climate watchers will be looking to see if the plan does anything to speed up the pace of decarbonization after Beijing set what’s widely seen as a conservative 2035 climate target last year. The key stat to watch for is China’s target for carbon intensity — that is, a measure of how much it emits per unit of GDP. It’s currently off track of its last five-year plan created in 2020. How much policymakers push to close the gap will be a critical litmus test for China’s climate leadership amid global backpedaling. —Lili Pike Can diplomats make headway at COP31? International negotiators will spend much of this year trying to create a bare-bones road map to phase out fossil fuels and another to eliminate deforestation. The two issues were left unresolved at the COP30 climate summit in Brazil last year. But with the nation in control of the COP presidency this year, it has a chance to make progress. The first key milestone will be a conference in Colombia in April focused on phasing out fossil fuels. Negotiators will continue to hash out their differences at the Bonn Climate Change Conference in June, as well as at London and New York’s climate weeks held in June and September, respectively. The world’s efforts will culminate at COP31, which will take place in Antalya, Turkey, in November. —Laura Millan Look to developing countries for climate progress In recent years, there have been breakout climate success stories in developing countries, largely enabled by cheap Chinese clean tech exports. Bangladesh off-grid home solar installations set a record globally, enabling rapid rural electrification. Pakistan’s huge purchase of solar panels and batteries have led the country to abandon natural gas as a strategic fuel. And Ethiopia’s de facto ban on fossil-fuel car imports has led to a surge in electric vehicle sales. These transitions were largely driven by access to Chinese technology. With the country’s green exports increasing, expect more such stories to emerge in 2026. —Akshat Rathi The clean tech revival continues Global climate tech investment made a comeback in 2025, largely driven by growing data center energy demand. The surge is likely to continue this year, with both nascent nuclear technologies and proven renewable solutions set to draw investor interest. Upgrading the power grid is likely to see continued investments as well, giving a boost to everything from battery energy storage to power management software. But questions remain about whether the artificial intelligence boom can continue to sustain the climate tech sector, and how to bring growth to companies beyond the energy ecosystem. —Coco Liu Nuclear energy’s boom is just over the horizon Data centers are sucking up electricity as fast as new power plants can get built, and Big Tech is willing to throw big money at nuclear. Dozens of companies are working on the next generation of small reactors, and the Trump administration is pushing to streamline the regulatory process and lining up billions in financing for big ones. More than 60 reactors were under construction worldwide at the end of 2025, though the world’s nuclear capacity contracted a bit. Yet even friendly regulations and fat checks can only do so much to accelerate the notoriously slow-moving industry. That means that while the nuclear sector will start to see momentum in 2026, it’s still a few years away from bringing a wave of new plants online. —Will Wade Will the AI bubble burst? Last year began with a crash in AI-related stocks after news of Chinese company DeepSeek’s more efficient models threw a wrench in power demand growth projections. Will there be another “DeepSeek moment” in 2026? That’s a question that’s on investors’ minds, even as money keeps pouring into AI and the energy sector. Even if models don’t become more efficient, the bubble could burst in other ways. Already, clean energy and real estate developers are sounding the alarm that electric grids, permitting and regulations aren’t keeping up with the pace of interconnection. Some regions are seeing years-long queues to hook up power projects to the grid, and there are backlogs for the crucial electric infrastructure. If the friction continues, AI investors could find their ambitions thwarted or that they’ll have to rely more on developing power onsite and behind the meter. —Michelle Ma Everyone wants a piece of the Arctic “What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic” is a truism that’s become irrefutable. This past year was the hottest in 125 years of records at the top of the planet, and the spill-over effect of that is beginning to be felt everywhere else, from rising seas to an uptick in atmospheric carbon. Rising temperatures also have the world increasingly looking at how to exploit the region. In 2026, expect previously local or regional Arctic issues — from ports to critical mineral development — to become international priorities. They include how China’s push to transport cargo through the Northern Sea Route will impact fragile ecosystems, and whether Trump’s push for the US to take over Greenland becomes more aggressive. —Danielle Bochove The EV market splits The global transition to electric vehicles will fracture in 2026, as EV sales slow in the US and scoot ahead in the rest of the world. BloombergNEF expects drivers to snap up 16.9 million EVs globally through September. That would be an increase of 16% over the year-earlier period. The tide of affordable and well-reviewed Chinese machines from companies like BYD and SAIC Motor will help drive the uptick in sales, building on 2025’s rise in exports. The EV outlook is far cloudier in the US, which still largely bars Chinese cars and trucks. The sunset of federal subsidies on EV purchases in September slammed the brakes on electric car adoption in the US. BNEF expects US sales to essentially stay level in the first half of the year and dip in the third quarter, in comparison to the market’s record run in August, September and October of this year. —Kyle Stock What will New York City do about BlackRock? Three of the city’s five pension funds are weighing whether to drop BlackRock’s $42 billion mandate because of the asset manager’s climate policies. Former Comptroller Brad Lander made a recommendation late last year after a formal review of all the fund managers overseeing the city’s retirement money, citing BlackRock’s failure to tackle global warming. Lander tried to pass the resolution to cut out the money manager in December, but he was unable to convince pension board of trustee members to hold a vote before the end of the year. Now, it will be up to new comptroller Mark Levine to hold a vote this year. Mayor Zohran Mamdani will also have a significant amount of influence over the outcome of the vote. It will come as BlackRock faces other headwinds: Late last year, the firm lost a mandate with a Dutch pension fund due in part to climate-related concerns. —Olivia Raimonde Climate risk modeling gains steam Demand is high and growing for accurate, usable climate information, particularly information that can help assess risk. That’s driving researchers to probe every level of risk and solution, from neighborhoods exposed to more frequent flooding, to whether proposed atmospheric cooling approaches can work safely, if at all. The clamor for actionable information comes as the Trump administration tries to dismantle much of the infrastructure in the US that underpins world-leading science. That includes hiding reports and data; cutting staff and funding; and putting out analyses that cherry-pick data downplaying climate change. The next 12 months are shaping up as a fight for more accurate climate information and an increasingly challenging environment to find it. —Eric Roston US renewables face a bumpy road The boom days for clean energy in the US are over — for now. Trump’s efforts to halt the buildout of solar and wind have resulted in policy and financial headwinds that will continue to be a big challenge for the industry. Large-scale solar installations, while still expected to make up the bulk of all new power plant additions, are forecast to decline as lucrative federal tax incentives start to fade away by mid-year and tariffs raise costs, according to BloombergNEF. Rooftop solar tax credits for homeowners also got wiped out, though leasing panels will still qualify. Wind developers may be even harder off. Subsidies have disappeared, and the Trump administration has thrown up additional permitting hurdles. The one bright spot? Batteries, which can still qualify for tax breaks if they satisfy new rules restricting the amount of materials that can come from China. Data centers are likely to be a strong source of power demand, which could help the industry. And clean energy developers are hopeful that artificial intelligence’s power needs will convince Trump to ease his assault on the industry. —Mark Chediak The EPA’s biggest climate attack is coming A process initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency last summer to unravel the federal government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases is set to conclude this year. The EPA is expected to finalize the controversial rulemaking that would rollback the so-called endangerment finding and immediately remove greenhouse gas regulations for passenger cars and trucks. While the administration has rolled back a number of climate rules, this would be the most consequential yet. Any decision to rescind the endangerment finding will undoubtedly be swiftly challenged in the courts, kicking off an epic legal battle that could determine how much the federal government can do to respond to global warming. —Zahra Hirji FEMA’s fate will be decided The Trump administration spent 2025 weighing whether or not to abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with the president establishing a review council co-chaired by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The group was tasked with providing recommendations on what to do with the agency, which it’s expected to finalize early this year. Disaster researchers, state and local emergency managers, and FEMA staff are all waiting to see how dramatic the proposed reforms will be. Although the president doesn’t hold the exclusive power to dissolve the agency in its entirety — that power rests in the hands of Congress — there’s a lot Trump can change, or at least try to. —Zahra Hirji Can California meet its climate goals? This new year marks the 20th anniversary of California’s landmark climate law that has transformed the Golden State into a green powerhouse. But it’ll spend 2026 fending off the Trump administration’s campaign to dismantle its authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump tax bill’s elimination of federal renewable energy and electric vehicle incentives is already slowing California’s progress toward reaching net-zero emissions by 2045. With the administration trying to scuttle the state’s cap-and-trade market, expect California to continue to spend more time fighting back in the courts and developing workarounds. Beyond Trump’s reach, local and regional California agencies continue to eliminate fossil fuels. A Bay Area ban on the sale of gas water heaters and furnaces, for instance, begins to take effect in 2027 and will apply to a fifth of the state’s population. —Todd Woody –With assistance from Akshat Rathi, Coco Liu, Danielle Bochove, Eric Roston, Kyle Stock, Laura Millan, Mark Chediak, Michelle Ma, Olivia Raimonde, Todd Woody, Will Wade and Zahra Hirji.

January 02, 2026 12:45 ET | Source: USA News Group USA News Group VANCOUVER, Jan. 02, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- USA News Group News Commentary – As global adversaries field operational hypersonic vehicles, the U.S. has reached a 'Sputnik moment' for tactical space access. With the Pentagon committing over $6.9 billion to hypersonic weapons development for FY 2025[1], the market is no longer looking for 'cheap rides'—it is looking for Speed Superiority. Now , the hypersonic technology market is projected to reach $8.46 billion in 2025, driven by these recent hypersonic weapons Pentagon allocations[2]. This strategic pivot toward speed and agility drives the investment thesis for Starfighters Space, Inc. (NYSE-A: FJET), AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS), Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ: RKLB), L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ: KTOS). Global commercial space launch services are expanding at a 14.6% CAGR, with the sector valued at $8.2 billion in 2024 as satellite operators demand rapid deployment and mission flexibility[3]. Space Force FY 2026 budget authorizations approaching $40 billion underscore the urgency for reusable platforms, hypersonic propulsion systems, and resilient satellite networks that can respond to emerging threats within hours rather than months[4]. Starfighters Space, Inc. (NYSE-A: FJET) closed out 2025 by recently providing a year-end corporate update following its successful listing on the NYSE American exchange, highlighting what the aerospace company describes as a transformational year. Operating out of NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida alongside major players like SpaceX and Blue Origin, Starfighters owns and operates the world's largest commercial supersonic aircraft fleet, a defensible operational monopoly as the only commercial entity globally capable of sustained MACH 2 mission profiles. The company's platform centers on a fleet of seven F-104 Starfighter aircraft, the only commercially available jets capable of sustained MACH 2 flight. These aircraft serve as a reusable first stage, carrying payloads to 45,000 feet before launching them toward space. This approach offers customers something traditional rocket launches cannot: flexible scheduling, rapid turnaround times, and the ability to choose specific orbital destinations without the delays that plague rideshare launch systems. "Starfighters' public listing represents a significant milestone for the Company and reflects growing investor interest in companies providing real-world aerospace capabilities aligned with national security, space access, and advanced testing requirements," said Rick Svetkoff, CEO of Starfighters. "The Company is well positioned to deliver services to a range of customers through our fast, innovative and unique platform." The timing of Starfighters' market entry aligns with shifting policy priorities. A December 18, 2025 White House Executive Order on space superiority emphasized responsive architectures, accelerated commercial integration, and expanded testing capabilities. The order reinforces demand for exactly what Starfighters provides: commercially operated platforms supporting government, defense, and space-adjacent missions. Starfighters generates revenue through multiple channels beyond satellite launches. The company supports hypersonic weapons testing in partnership with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), addresses a critical national security priority given that both Russia and China have deployed operational hypersonic systems. With strategic competitors like Russia and China having already fielded operational hypersonic vehicles, Starfighters’ specialized testing partnership with the AFRL establishes the company as a 'critical path' for the United States to achieve and maintain technological parity. Additional services include payload testing, pilot training, microgravity experiments, and spaceflight hardware qualification. Current customers span defense and commercial sectors, including Lockheed Martin, GE, Innoveering, Space Florida, and the Air Force Research Laboratory. The company's STARLAUNCH program, based on proven AIM-120 missile technology with over 17,500 units built, targets small satellite operators facing the industry's fundamental dilemma: expensive dedicated launches versus unpredictable rideshare schedules. With projected costs around $15,000 per kilogram at scale, Starfighters aims to occupy the middle ground between these options while offering superior schedule control and mission flexibility. By targeting a scaled cost of $15,000 per kilogram, Starfighters Space Inc. provides a high-cadence, cost-resilient alternative to expensive dedicated launches, positioning it as a vital solution for a Pentagon focused on maximizing its $40 billion Space Force budget amid shifting fiscal priorities. AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) recently successfully launched BlueBird 6, the largest commercial communications array ever deployed in low Earth orbit at nearly 2,400 square feet—over three times the size and ten times the capacity of the company's existing satellites currently in orbit. The satellite, which lifted off December 23, 2025 from India's Satish Dhawan Space Centre, is designed to enable peak data rates up to 120 Mbps directly to standard mobile devices, supporting voice, data, and video applications critical for both commercial users and government operations. The advanced platform addresses critical security and connectivity needs by providing reliable communications infrastructure accessible anywhere on Earth, including remote and disaster-affected areas where traditional terrestrial networks are unavailable or compromised. "BlueBird 6 is a breakthrough moment for AST SpaceMobile," said Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of AST SpaceMobile. "This launch validates years of U.S. innovation and American manufacturing, executed by our team and marks the transition to scaled deployment." The company plans to launch 45-60 satellites by the end of 2026, with missions scheduled every one to two months on average, as it builds out global coverage for its network of over 50 mobile operator partners representing nearly 3 billion subscribers combined. AST SpaceMobile maintains partnerships with major carriers including AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, Google, American Tower, Bell, and stc Group, while operating nearly 500,000 square feet of manufacturing facilities worldwide supported by over 1,800 employees. Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDQ: RKLB) concluded 2025 with its 21st successful Electron launch of the year, achieving 100% mission success while deploying the QPS-SAR-15 synthetic aperture radar satellite for Japan-based Earth imaging company Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space (iQPS). The December 21st mission from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand adds critical imaging capabilities to iQPS' constellation, which provides near-real-time surveillance imagery across twelve different orbits for customers requiring persistent Earth observation for security and defense applications. The record-setting performance cements Electron as both America's preeminent small launch provider and the world's most frequently-launched small-lift orbital rocket, demonstrating the reliability required for national security missions. "In 2026 we're expanding Electron's global reach with more multi-launch constellation deployments, dedicated missions for domestic civil space and international space agencies in Japan and Europe, and both suborbital and orbital launches with defense applications for hypersonic technology and national security," said Sir Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab. "Our new record of annual launches and the breadth of upcoming missions goes to show how much of a global impact Electron continues to have on the space industry." Rocket Lab has completed seven satellite deployments for iQPS to date, making Electron the primary launcher for the constellation, with five additional missions scheduled beginning in 2026. The company's 79 total Electron missions have established the platform as essential infrastructure for defense customers requiring rapid, reliable access to space for surveillance, communications, and emerging hypersonic test applications. L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX) recently received a letter of intent from Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ: KTOS) for a commercial contract to produce 60 Zeus hypersonic motors, representing a more than 50% increase in L3Harris' annual production rate for these advanced propulsion systems. The Zeus motors support U.S. Department of Defense customers conducting critical hypersonic vehicle and ballistic missile defense testing, including programs such as the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed, following successful development and flight testing of both Zeus 1 and 2 motor variants by Kratos. The expanded production addresses accelerating demand for hypersonic test capabilities as the Pentagon, National Science Foundation, and U.S. Congress pursue development of hypersonic systems to counter advanced threats from strategic competitors. "We are pleased to continue working with Kratos and to support significant production increases for the Zeus advanced large solid rocket motors," said Ken Bedingfield, President of Aerojet Rocketdyne at L3Harris. "By incorporating cutting-edge propulsion technology and delivering unmatched performance, these motors meet the rigorous demands of today's missions while scaling for the challenges of tomorrow." The Zeus motors replace legacy suborbital rocket motors in fit and form while delivering increased performance when integrated with existing test infrastructure and vehicle designs, enabling faster iteration cycles for hypersonic weapons development without requiring costly ground infrastructure modifications. L3Harris designs the motors at its Huntsville, Alabama facility to Kratos specifications and manufactures them at the company's nearly 2,000-acre energetics campus in Camden, Arkansas, where it produces more than 115,000 solid rocket motors annually—from palm-sized units to systems the size of an SUV. The production expansion comes as both Russia and China field operational hypersonic vehicles, with the Pentagon publicly committing $4.7 billion for hypersonic research in 2023 according to Congressional Research Service reporting, underscoring the strategic importance of domestic hypersonic test capabilities for maintaining U.S. technological superiority.

January 02, 2026 12:45 ET | Source: USA News Group USA News Group VANCOUVER, Jan. 02, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- USA News Group News Commentary – As global adversaries field operational hypersonic vehicles, the U.S. has reached a 'Sputnik moment' for tactical space access. With the Pentagon committing over $6.9 billion to hypersonic weapons development for FY 2025[1], the market is no longer looking for 'cheap rides'—it is looking for Speed Superiority. Now , the hypersonic technology market is projected to reach $8.46 billion in 2025, driven by these recent hypersonic weapons Pentagon allocations[2]. This strategic pivot toward speed and agility drives the investment thesis for Starfighters Space, Inc. (NYSE-A: FJET), AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS), Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ: RKLB), L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ: KTOS). Global commercial space launch services are expanding at a 14.6% CAGR, with the sector valued at $8.2 billion in 2024 as satellite operators demand rapid deployment and mission flexibility[3]. Space Force FY 2026 budget authorizations approaching $40 billion underscore the urgency for reusable platforms, hypersonic propulsion systems, and resilient satellite networks that can respond to emerging threats within hours rather than months[4]. Starfighters Space, Inc. (NYSE-A: FJET) closed out 2025 by recently providing a year-end corporate update following its successful listing on the NYSE American exchange, highlighting what the aerospace company describes as a transformational year. Operating out of NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida alongside major players like SpaceX and Blue Origin, Starfighters owns and operates the world's largest commercial supersonic aircraft fleet, a defensible operational monopoly as the only commercial entity globally capable of sustained MACH 2 mission profiles. The company's platform centers on a fleet of seven F-104 Starfighter aircraft, the only commercially available jets capable of sustained MACH 2 flight. These aircraft serve as a reusable first stage, carrying payloads to 45,000 feet before launching them toward space. This approach offers customers something traditional rocket launches cannot: flexible scheduling, rapid turnaround times, and the ability to choose specific orbital destinations without the delays that plague rideshare launch systems. "Starfighters' public listing represents a significant milestone for the Company and reflects growing investor interest in companies providing real-world aerospace capabilities aligned with national security, space access, and advanced testing requirements," said Rick Svetkoff, CEO of Starfighters. "The Company is well positioned to deliver services to a range of customers through our fast, innovative and unique platform." The timing of Starfighters' market entry aligns with shifting policy priorities. A December 18, 2025 White House Executive Order on space superiority emphasized responsive architectures, accelerated commercial integration, and expanded testing capabilities. The order reinforces demand for exactly what Starfighters provides: commercially operated platforms supporting government, defense, and space-adjacent missions. Starfighters generates revenue through multiple channels beyond satellite launches. The company supports hypersonic weapons testing in partnership with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), addresses a critical national security priority given that both Russia and China have deployed operational hypersonic systems. With strategic competitors like Russia and China having already fielded operational hypersonic vehicles, Starfighters’ specialized testing partnership with the AFRL establishes the company as a 'critical path' for the United States to achieve and maintain technological parity. Additional services include payload testing, pilot training, microgravity experiments, and spaceflight hardware qualification. Current customers span defense and commercial sectors, including Lockheed Martin, GE, Innoveering, Space Florida, and the Air Force Research Laboratory. The company's STARLAUNCH program, based on proven AIM-120 missile technology with over 17,500 units built, targets small satellite operators facing the industry's fundamental dilemma: expensive dedicated launches versus unpredictable rideshare schedules. With projected costs around $15,000 per kilogram at scale, Starfighters aims to occupy the middle ground between these options while offering superior schedule control and mission flexibility. By targeting a scaled cost of $15,000 per kilogram, Starfighters Space Inc. provides a high-cadence, cost-resilient alternative to expensive dedicated launches, positioning it as a vital solution for a Pentagon focused on maximizing its $40 billion Space Force budget amid shifting fiscal priorities. AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) recently successfully launched BlueBird 6, the largest commercial communications array ever deployed in low Earth orbit at nearly 2,400 square feet—over three times the size and ten times the capacity of the company's existing satellites currently in orbit. The satellite, which lifted off December 23, 2025 from India's Satish Dhawan Space Centre, is designed to enable peak data rates up to 120 Mbps directly to standard mobile devices, supporting voice, data, and video applications critical for both commercial users and government operations. The advanced platform addresses critical security and connectivity needs by providing reliable communications infrastructure accessible anywhere on Earth, including remote and disaster-affected areas where traditional terrestrial networks are unavailable or compromised. "BlueBird 6 is a breakthrough moment for AST SpaceMobile," said Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of AST SpaceMobile. "This launch validates years of U.S. innovation and American manufacturing, executed by our team and marks the transition to scaled deployment." The company plans to launch 45-60 satellites by the end of 2026, with missions scheduled every one to two months on average, as it builds out global coverage for its network of over 50 mobile operator partners representing nearly 3 billion subscribers combined. AST SpaceMobile maintains partnerships with major carriers including AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, Google, American Tower, Bell, and stc Group, while operating nearly 500,000 square feet of manufacturing facilities worldwide supported by over 1,800 employees. Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDQ: RKLB) concluded 2025 with its 21st successful Electron launch of the year, achieving 100% mission success while deploying the QPS-SAR-15 synthetic aperture radar satellite for Japan-based Earth imaging company Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space (iQPS). The December 21st mission from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand adds critical imaging capabilities to iQPS' constellation, which provides near-real-time surveillance imagery across twelve different orbits for customers requiring persistent Earth observation for security and defense applications. The record-setting performance cements Electron as both America's preeminent small launch provider and the world's most frequently-launched small-lift orbital rocket, demonstrating the reliability required for national security missions. "In 2026 we're expanding Electron's global reach with more multi-launch constellation deployments, dedicated missions for domestic civil space and international space agencies in Japan and Europe, and both suborbital and orbital launches with defense applications for hypersonic technology and national security," said Sir Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab. "Our new record of annual launches and the breadth of upcoming missions goes to show how much of a global impact Electron continues to have on the space industry." Rocket Lab has completed seven satellite deployments for iQPS to date, making Electron the primary launcher for the constellation, with five additional missions scheduled beginning in 2026. The company's 79 total Electron missions have established the platform as essential infrastructure for defense customers requiring rapid, reliable access to space for surveillance, communications, and emerging hypersonic test applications. L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX) recently received a letter of intent from Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ: KTOS) for a commercial contract to produce 60 Zeus hypersonic motors, representing a more than 50% increase in L3Harris' annual production rate for these advanced propulsion systems. The Zeus motors support U.S. Department of Defense customers conducting critical hypersonic vehicle and ballistic missile defense testing, including programs such as the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed, following successful development and flight testing of both Zeus 1 and 2 motor variants by Kratos. The expanded production addresses accelerating demand for hypersonic test capabilities as the Pentagon, National Science Foundation, and U.S. Congress pursue development of hypersonic systems to counter advanced threats from strategic competitors. "We are pleased to continue working with Kratos and to support significant production increases for the Zeus advanced large solid rocket motors," said Ken Bedingfield, President of Aerojet Rocketdyne at L3Harris. "By incorporating cutting-edge propulsion technology and delivering unmatched performance, these motors meet the rigorous demands of today's missions while scaling for the challenges of tomorrow." The Zeus motors replace legacy suborbital rocket motors in fit and form while delivering increased performance when integrated with existing test infrastructure and vehicle designs, enabling faster iteration cycles for hypersonic weapons development without requiring costly ground infrastructure modifications. L3Harris designs the motors at its Huntsville, Alabama facility to Kratos specifications and manufactures them at the company's nearly 2,000-acre energetics campus in Camden, Arkansas, where it produces more than 115,000 solid rocket motors annually—from palm-sized units to systems the size of an SUV. The production expansion comes as both Russia and China field operational hypersonic vehicles, with the Pentagon publicly committing $4.7 billion for hypersonic research in 2023 according to Congressional Research Service reporting, underscoring the strategic importance of domestic hypersonic test capabilities for maintaining U.S. technological superiority.

(NASDAQ: BMNR) today announced the release of a new Chairman's message (link) outlining why shareholders are being asked to vote YES on a proposal to increase the Company's authorized shares. The message is now available on the Bitmine website and is intended to provide additional context ahead of the upcoming shareholder vote. The voting deadline is January 14, 2026 at 11:59 p.m. ET. In the video, Chairman Tom Lee explains the rationale behind Proposal 2, which seeks shareholder approval to amend the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase authorized shares from 500 million to 50 billion. There are three reasons the Company needs to increase authorized shares: Since pivoting in July to make Ethereum (ETH) its primary treasury asset, Bitmine has observed that its share price has closely tracked movements in ETH. *Coefficient (per Bloomberg) is 0.015 ETH price plus accretion of ETH/share The scatter chart in the gallery above shows the clear linkage (x-axis is ETH, y-axis is BMNR). The Company believes Ethereum represents the future of finance, a supercycle driven by Wall Street reengineering on the blockchain. Major industry leaders agree, including Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, who said that tokenization is the next evolution of global markets. And the vast majority of tokenization is happening on Ethereum. Previously, Bitmine noted its view that tokenization will drive ETH/BTC to reach all-time highs (0.0873). This implies future ETH prices of: These potential future ETH prices can be used to calculate "implied" future BMNR prices** **These are using the coefficient 0.15* ETH plus assumed accretion ETH/share of 33%. These are for illustrative purposes only. Not a forecast. To keep shares "accessible" to the public, the Company would want to split the shares, to reset the share price back towards $25. If BMNR shares are: These splits will increase total shares outstanding. Thus, Bitmine can only split shares in the future if the total authorized shares is increased. Shareholders are encouraged to review the Chairman's message and vote prior to the January 14, 2026 deadline and are welcome to attend the annual meeting on January 15, 2026, at the Wynn Las Vegas.

Title: Tom Lee urges BitMine shareholders to approve share increase ahead of January 14 vote

Full Content:
Tom Lee, chairman of ether ETH$3,130.35 treasury firm BitMine Immersion (BMNR), urged shareholders to approve a board proposal for a sharp increase in the company's authorized share count. In a start-of-the-year message, Lee said the proposal to boost the company's number of shares to 50 billion from 500 million is not a precursor to a move to "dilute" shareholders. “[This]t doesn’t mean we’re issuing 50 billion shares. That’s what we want the total max shares to be,” Lee said. Acknowledging that a higher share count does make it easier to enable the company to raise capital, Lee reminded that it also allows BitMine to pursue opportunistic dealmaking and — most importantly, according to Lee — accommodate future share splits. Lee argued that BitMine’s share price has increasingly tracked ether since the company pivoted last year to make ETH its primary treasury asset. If ether's price rises over the years as he expects — as high as $250,000 if bitcoin reaches $1 million — splits will be necessary to keep shares "accessible" to the public. Lee framed the proposal within a broader thesis that Ethereum will play a central role in Wall Street’s push toward tokenized financial markets, pointing to public comments by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink about blockchain-based market infrastructure. Lee has separately said he has been accumulating ether personally, aligning his macro view with BitMine’s treasury strategy. Lee reminded shareholders that they have until Jan. 14 to vote on the proposal, with BitMine’s annual shareholder meeting scheduled for Jan. 15 in Las Vegas.

Time Published: 2026-01-02T17:01:00Z
Full Content:
2025 was an overwhelming year. Let's savor those positives in unlikely places. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. With each passing year, the PC gaming scene grows increasingly fragmented. More games are released, and on average they're better, too. There's just not enough time to cover them all, and 2025 was packed with gems you probably haven't heard of. For those willing to go just a little off the beaten path, the current Steam Winter Sale looks like a never-ending bounty of undersold treasures. So here's a carefully curated selection of 15 of my favorites to consider during the last couple days of sales season. Here are the rules I'm narrowing things down with: Since the year was so densely packed, I'm annoying the editors by slipping in a thematically related (but less beholden to the rules) alternative to each pick, for 30 games total. As ever, shout out your favourites, or comment if I helped you find something that made your heart sing. Let's go! Price: $21 / £17.50 (30% off) | Developer: Siris Pendrake A stunning testament to what a (mostly) solo developer can do with a modern engine and some stock asset packs. Still in early access, but already a very polished, lengthy and non-linear STALKER-inspired shooter with a funky setting. Mankind is effectively extinct. Lizard-people (which you're one of) have inherited the ruins of our civilization, and ancient fae magics leak in through the cracks of reality, as if rogue super-science wasn't enough. Project Silverfish feels like a pared-down, greased-up version of STALKER. Faster, twitchier, impressively polished (at the expense of some detail), able to run great on even lower-spec machines and requiring less fiddling around between sorties. Expect to be thrown into messy multi-faction battles right off the bat with loads of loot, getting you into deeper expeditions early. Alternatively: ADACA (50% off) - The previous game from the same developer, and effectively two games in one: A Half-Life 2/Halo-inspired story campaign and a STALKER-lite sandbox. Both surprisingly slick (and officially finished as of 2024), but Silverfish's open world & systems are on another level. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Price: $14 / £11.72 (30% off) | Developer: Figburn & Melon Hands up if you've still got a special place in your heart for Flash-era gaming, specifically Newgrounds. Contract Rush DX is a game forged in those familiar fires. It's a little bit Mega Man, a little bit Contra and more than a dash of Alien Hominid, all held together with globs of slick vectorized cartoon animation, unrealistic hyperviolence and goofy humor. They don't often make them like this anymore. Contract Rush DX doesn't rest on its nostalgic laurels though. There's a beefy, smart platformer here, with its main levels playable in any order and each with a distinct feel and mechanical twist. Recruit new characters to access extra areas or tackle bonus side-missions and work your way closer to the lore-laden reveals of the game's well-hidden True Ending. Alternatively: Seafrog (50% off) - Another platforming gem that fell between the cracks, now refreshed and under a new publisher's banner. A slick, high-technique blend of traditional platforming and Tony Hawk style skating, with big rewards for chaining long trick combos, giving every stage real replay value. Price: $12 / £10.05 (40% off) | Developer: LimboLane Not just a hidden gem, but one of my favourites of 2025. You're a Godpoke, wrangler of deities, sent to help put the bickering gods of this bizarre cartoon world back on the straight-and-narrow to avert the apocalypse. A refreshing take on the point-and-click adventure, as rather than hoard every item you find, you make up for your own quiet nature by using your suck 'n' blow megaphone to steal phrases from characters' dialogue and deploying them elsewhere as potential solutions. Or just to goof around. As with LimboLane's previous Smile For Me, this is an entire world of Weird Little Guys, even the cosmically huge gods. Everyone's at least a little bit of a freak, but they're all weirdly lovable. Especially the chaotically helpful 'bizzyboys' gang, the solution to and source of half the game's problems, and frequently featured in some deeply strange FMV puppet-show segments. Alternatively: Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo (40% off) - another offbeat adventure about hanging out with weird little guys of myth and legend. This time you're a snake-spirit in the Latin-American afterlife, trying to puzzle out how to break the eternal day-long loop that the dead are trapped in. Heartfelt, bittersweet and frequently funny. Price: $14 / £11.72 (30% off) | Developer: 13AM Games, Mighty Yell If you were to make a new Missile Command game, what kind of game would it be? Probably not 'Teen drama escape-room with tactical hex-based strategy'. This bizarre hybrid hasn't sold well at all, but it's a shockingly good and engaging time. Four teens set out to explore an abandoned cold war bunker, only to find themselves wrapped up in an escalating crisis necessitating a lot of point-and-click style puzzling and some almost Into The Breach-esque defensive turn-based battling. The combat involves planning moves two or three steps ahead, saving resources by catching multiple incoming missiles in chaining explosions, just like the old arcade game. The two halves dovetail nicely, using smaller defensive battle simulations as puzzle elements, while the larger, higher-stakes battles can dig into your stock of missile launch keycards that you scavenge from the dusty corners of the adventuring puzzle rooms, making resource conservation all the more vital. Tense and smart. Alternatively: Is This Game Trying To Kill Me? (50% off) - Another genre-hopping escape room adventure, although this one feels heavily inspired by Inscryption, as you explore a haunted videogame and the videogames within that videogame while being tormented by the (weirdly affable) entity lurking outside the rain-slick cabin window. Fun, goofy meta-narrative puzzling. Price: $6 / £5.10 (40% off) | Developer: Bubby Darkstar Shooty is our best, last line of defence against a possible robot invasion. Her crack team of robot-hunting pals are goofing off at the beach today. She doesn't have any clean clothes so she's requisitioning her commander's trousers today. Oh, and the robots are finally invading, but they don't seem to be especially threatening so you can just take your time and do some errands around town. Nobody seems too threatened. Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion feels like playing a webcomic. A particularly raucous, bright and chaotic one. Perhaps I'm just weird, but it's one of the funniest games I've played this past year, only really beaten out by Skin Deep. It's 70% exploring and meeting weird people and helping them with their daily problems, 30% light FPS combat as you blast robots using your special high-tech anti-robot bullets that only hurt machines. It's a surprisingly full package as well, clocking in at ~8 hours of shenanigans. Longer, if you're hunting for each mini open world level's secret sidequests. Alternatively: Fragrance Point (50% off) - Another 'Goofing around with weirdos' adventure, with a great rendercore aesthetic and an esoteric sci-fi spin. You're a new being, constructed to complete a very specific mission that you never got told because you accidentally blew up the tutorial by spitting lipstick everywhere. But hey, this space station seems to be a 24/7 party zone, so just go with the flow! Price: $18 / £15 (40% off) | Developer: Blue Banshee In a fit of spectacularly unfortunate timing, Maliki: Poison Of The Past was an offbeat take on the JRPG formula by a French studio released just two days before Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. It's arguably even more French, being based on a very long-running anime-tinged francophone webcomic, although no knowledge of the source material is needed to enjoy this standalone time-travelling adventure in high-intensity gardening. There is a lot going on here. Traditional turn-based RPG combat (with some timeline shenanigans); time-manipulating puzzles reminiscent of Zelda, with each party member bringing a new puzzle-solving power to the mix; even some low-impact farming between sorties across the timeline on your quest to stop the titular Poison, an evil plant-entity spreading its roots across space and time. It would be easy to draw comparisons to Chrono Trigger, but this one is a rich enough mix of inspirations to feel like its own thing. Alternatively: Wander Stars (33% off) - Another offbeat take on classic JRPG tropes, this time from Venezuela, and paying more than a little tribute to Akira Toriyama's wacky world of pint-sized martial artists and screwball comedy. Gorgeous art, simple, fight-heavy progression and creative combat where you collect a deck of words to chain into increasingly silly attack names to yell at full volume. Price: $10.50 / £7 (30% off) | Developer: Woodhound I've always had a soft spot for free-flying PSX-era shooter Forsaken, a faster, louder version of Descent. Despite an excellent (and cheap!) Nightdive remaster, it seemed doomed to fall into obscurity. But tiny studio Woodhound seems to hold a special torch for it too, releasing this roguelike tribute out of early access in 2025. It looks, sounds and plays almost exactly like Forsaken, right down to the intentionally blurry 'early 3D accelerator' textures and overbearing colored lighting, but now with near endless replay value and online co-op support. While Desecrators might lose something by not having hand-crafted levels, it does a very good job of procedurally generating labyrinthine mazes of tunnels, chambers and combat zones to blast through, punctuated with botmatch-style 'invasions' by rival treasure-hunters. It's still growing, too, with new enemies and environments added in a recent update, along with tentative VR support for those with strong stomachs. Alternatively: BRAZILIAN DRUG DEALER 3: I OPENED A PORTAL TO HELL IN THE FAVELA TRYING TO REVIVE MIT AIA I NEED TO CLOSE IT (30% off) - Another very singular tribute, although more of a deep cut. A tongue-in-cheek dive into the world of Brazil's early modding and game-dev scene, filled with in-jokes weirdness and an AMAZING title. But even taken purely on face value, it's a fun shooter running on the original Quake engine. Price: $3 / £2.55 (70% off) | Developer: Leafy Games Short, sweet and low-impact. At three dollars, it's very easy to recommend Wyrmhall, a game about being a funny little goblin running an artifact-cleaning stall in the middle of an interdimensional nexus. Weirdos from across the multiverse wander in, show you their cool (but all gunked up) cursed/blessed/incredibly dangerous doodads, chatting with you as you delouse, scrub and polish them up. The artifacts, not the clients. Although sometimes they're one and the same. Clocking in at just a couple hours long (with no shortage of twists and turns), this isn't an intense or complex game, but it is extremely funny, like playing through an extended Adventure Time skit full of gloriously wacky characters and some fun dialogue options that let you embrace your inner goblin. A good reminder that 'cozy' gaming doesn't just have to be about repackaged farming lifestyle fantasies. Sometimes you just wanna go Goblin Mode. Alternatively: Trash Goblin (40% off) - Would you believe that 2025 had TWO games about being a funny little goblin that cleans up strange artifacts? Trash Goblin is a bit less funny, but more technical, involved and mechanically engaging, using a lot more tools and upcycling to make your own goodies. Hell of a coincidence for lightning to strike twice. Price: $14 / £11.72 (30% off) | Developer: Pocket Trap It's a common lament that Nintendo has little interest in 'traditional' Zelda games now, favoring open world grandiosity over the classic NES and SNES-era format. Fortunately indies have you covered, and few do it as well as Pipistrello. The bones are solid—all the dungeon-crawling, puzzle-solving action you'd expect, fleshed out with a funky modern urban setting populated by rough-edged (but adorable) graffiti-styled critters, and with a few modern ideas like buying character upgrades on credit and paying them off over time. The star of the show is the titular Cursed Yoyo. Weapon, mobility gadget, multifunctional puzzle-solving tool and just fun to show off with, you'll be collecting new tricks for it all game long and each one opens up interesting new paths, making revisiting older areas engaging. Use slanted blocks to hit entire rooms with one spin, slam it against walls to launch yourself backwards over pits, and bypass obstacles by dragging yourself along using its string. It's just a joy to use. Alternatively: Zefyr: A Thief's Melody (75% off) - 'Retro' extends well into the Gamecube era these days, and if you're after something a little more Wind Waker-inspired, Zefyr is an excellent PC alternative. The work of a solo developer over the course of twelve years, this one's a satisfying piratical fantasy adventure with some great puzzle-laden dungeons. Price: $7 / £5.95 (30% off) | Developer: Brenton Wildes Loathe as I am to utter the word 'Metroidbrainia', it feels appropriate here. Lingo 2 is a brilliantly smart word puzzle adventure through a minimalist, Minecraft-esque block labyrinth where you interact with the world by typing letters into terminals. Simple. Except that you have to unlock one letter at a time like Metroid upgrades, and the phrase-and-response puzzles get painfully smart, fast. Sometimes you're looking for a word of the inverse meaning, or an anagram, or a palindrome, or a synonym, or a chain of words that connect several terminals together. The deeper you get, the more puzzles become available, and the more complex the world becomes, with secrets, hidden paths and optional areas seemingly everywhere with puzzles both spatial and lexical. My only gripe is that the game can be a bit US-centric, with some puzzles referring to specific American brands or idioms, but I never found it too egregious. The original Lingo is also discounted, and has its own set of puzzle mechanics so you can play them in any order. Alternatively: Rules & Rodents (40% off) - On the other end of the puzzle scale is Rules & Rodents, which is entirely wordless. A cute little mouse plots a cheese heist/escape armed with a magical scroll that holds pictograms that enable or disable specific gameplay rules controlling both you and the adorably animated rat guards. Just a few hours long, but feels perfectly paced with a surprisingly dramatic finale. Price: $10 / £8.37 (50% off) | Developer: Erlend Kirkeboe, Kay Arne Kirkeboe You can't go 10 minutes without bumping into a Slay the Spire-inspired deckbuilder these days, but few have the scribbly, grimy vision of Skogdal. Set in small-town '90s Norway, you'll be making your way through the streets battling an assortment of meatheads, weirdos and wildlife, all rendered in lumpen pencil-sketch comic style. There's a bit of Beavis and Butthead energy here as your crew of weird losers clash with retro pop culture seen through a uniquely Nordic lens. While each playable character brings their own gimmicks to the table, there's a big focus here on summoning friends into battle, who add their own cards to your deck and often add activatable powers to your party. While run-based, there's an increasingly weird story that unfurls as you complete runs, unlocking new characters (including a knock-off Norwegian Steven Segal) and new routes through the region. Not being Norwegian, some of the gags flew over my head, but most of them feel universal enough to land. Alternatively: Crown Gambit (40% off) - The latest from the team behind previous hidden gem Aetheris. A gorgeously illustrated twist on the card-battler format, split about 50/50 between visual novel-ish gothic knightly intrigue (with multi-choice dialogues) and party-based strategic battles. The two halves interplay, with the size and shape of the combat play-field shifting to reflect the prose. Price: $7.79 / £6.50 (35% off) | Developer: Fami Rough-edged, low-fi and abrasive in style, Schism feels like the kind of game I devoured in my youth. The kind of vaguely punk design that ruled in the late DOS shareware era. Under the intentionally rough aesthetic lies a very smart, experimental take on Binding of Isaac-esque action roguelike shootery. Weird creatures, weird characters, and even weirder item synergies (thoughtfully evolved as this game stewed in early access) make this one refreshing to chew on even if you're played a bunch of Games Like These. Schism isn't afraid to mentally overwhelm the player. Outside of the one small concession of pausing time as you enter a new room (letting you plan your initial movement before all hell breaks looks), there's some Ikaruga-inspired polarity switching mechanics, letting you negate red or blue bullets. You'd think that'd make things easier, but it just gives the game an excuse to blanket the screen with projectiles. Intense fun. Alternatively: Rift Wizard 2 (50% off) - Another low-fi roguelike, but more traditional in design. Positively archaic, even. Rift Wizard 2 feels most closely related to Chaos, an early cast-em-up by X-Com designer Julian Gollop. Rather than crawl through mazes for loot, each floor is a complex, open turn-based tactical battle demanding you use all your spells and summons. Price: $17.50 / £14.69 (30% off) | Developer: Dreamotion Inc. One of the higher-budget games here, released just a couple months ago. A silly but often heartstring-tugging, genre-hopping adventure about a corgi deciding to leave Dog Heaven after catching the distant scent of their human. Antics ensue, rainbow bridges are surfed across, adventures through the afterlife are had and not a single chance is missed to squeeze Big Feels out of the audience. As you might imagine it's not especially challenging stuff, but there's enough variety across the adventure (including a bunch of minigames and light challenges) to keep you engaged and paying attention. Long enough to keep eyes on the screen so you don't miss any of its gorgeously animated cutscenes, bridged with hand-drawn art. There's a real understanding here of how dogs move, especially the inherent wigglyness of short-legged friends like corgis, which means if you've ever had or lost a fuzzy little friend in your life, this one is going to hurt. Alternatively: Koira (50% off) - A surprisingly similar adventure, this one with a silhouetted, storybook aesthetic. A hermit and their dog enjoy life and nature in the mountains, interacting with wildlife, communing with the spirits and absolutely not getting into any life-or-death ordeals or supernatural goings on. Needless to say, the dog is also very good. They all are. Price: $7 / £5.95 (30% off) | Developer: Last Piscean A fantastically smart piece of sci-fi narrative experimentation. After the end of the world, three children discover a time machine. Perhaps the present can be rewritten, but the problem is that you can only send one person back at a time, with a single standing order and maybe one item, and they're going to have to spend a decade in that era before returning to base and reporting in, perhaps bringing back an item with them. Every choice is to be agonized over. The time spent in the past changes your trio. Personalities and statistics warp over time. Piecing together the origins of the apocalypse is just the first part of the puzzle, with over 20 possible endings depending on what factions you nudge or nurture, who you choose to assassinate and which child you choose for each expedition to the past. For a game presented almost entirely in (thoughtfully written) text and low-fi monochrome art, Decade is powerfully evocative. Alternatively: No Time (35% off) - If you want your time travel a little less esoteric and more tangible, this Back To The Future-inspired sandbox immersive sim has been in early access since 2019, and just recently added the final mission in its main story arc, though there's plenty yet to come. Price: $2.50 / £2.14 (50% off) | Developer: Jack Morehart 2025 was mostly a year for playing it safe in the strategy genre. DLCs, familiar genres, remasters and revivals. Kiloton is the sicko pick (I did say fewer, not none)—a minimalist, fast-paced simulation that feels like something lifted straight out of Wargames. The only winning game might be not to play, but playing with nukes can still be pretty fun. It's a lightweight geopolitical sim where you're ideally trying to avoid conflict, but every country is automatically jostling for position, with armies drawn to where there's any gap in defences. Diplomacy IS an option, but might just be denying the inevitable, and matches play out in a matter of minutes. What makes this game especially for sickos is that you play it entirely with the keyboard, with typed menu commands and simple menus navigated with the arrow keys, your clicking keypresses echoed in the game's own soundscape. Great for building tension, and will keep your hands moving quickly as things spiral out of control. Alternatively: Chip n' Clawz vs The Brainioids (30% off) - Would you believe that the creator of X-Com released a new strategy game for 2025, and it totally flew under the radar? A cartoon action-strategy game (a bit like Brutal Legend) playable the whole way through in split-screen co-op or via Friend Pass. A great way to introduce kids to the genre, and not too shabby even for veterans. And that's it for 2025. It wasn't an intentional theme, but there sure were a lot of games about terrifying apocalypses and hanging out with Weird Little Guys, weren't there? Let's avoid the former, and hang on to the latter in 2026. At least the videogames will be good, eh? Once again, I hope I've helped broaden your horizons a little, and maybe introduced you to a game or two to love. As always, check out my previous roundups below (and maybe even my Steam curator page, where everything I enjoy goes), as almost everything from previous sales is back again at even steeper discounts, and still as good as ever: Until next time, and happy new year! The product of a wasted youth, wasted prime and getting into wasted middle age, Dominic Tarason is a freelance writer, occasional indie PR guy and professional techno-hermit seen in many strange corners of the internet and seldom in reality. Based deep in the Welsh hinterlands where no food delivery dares to go, videogames provide a gritty, realistic escape from the idyllic views and fresh country air. If you're looking for something new and potentially very weird to play, feel free to poke him on Bluesky. He's almost sociable, most of the time.

Title: Unemployment in Berkshire County rises to four-year high as job growth slows

Reporter Nursing students at Berkshire Community College use a simulator to stabilize a computer-controlled patient in 2022. Local workforce experts say there is a growing gap between the health care industry's needs and finding skilled workers. Training programs, like the one at BCC, are working to fill that need. Berkshire County’s unemployment rate climbed to 4 percent in September, the highest level the region has seen in four years. But even as unemployment rises, the labor market remains tight. Local employers are grappling with skill shortages, AI-driven hiring changes and evolving worker expectations — trends reflected across the U.S. as job growth slows and companies become more cautious. “We have had some layoffs in the area, but we are not seeing a big uptick in candidates coming in the door looking for work, so that’s kind of interesting,” said Guin Griswold, director of employment services at Molari Employment and Healthcare Services in Pittsfield. Maricelli Serrano of MassHire meets job applicants at a job fair in 2019. The MassHire Berkshire Career Center is a partnership between the Berkshire Training & Employment Program and the Massachusetts Division of Career Services. National job growth has also slowed in recent months. Federal data showed job losses in October followed by modest gains in November, pushing the national unemployment rate to 4.6 percent — its highest level since 2021. Tariffs, increases in wages and the impact of AI have stalled hiring momentum as companies like Amazon, Verizon, UPS and General Motors have announced job cuts. After 5 percent growth from 2019 to 2024, job growth slowed in 2025, said Heather Boulger, executive director of the MassHire Berkshire Workforce Board, a local organization that helps people find jobs. In September, 63,812 people were in the Berkshire County labor force, with 61,260 employed and 2,552 collecting unemployment insurance, according to data provided by Boulger. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the week ending Dec. 13 rose to 1.92 million, according to ABC News. The 4 percent unemployment rate in the Berkshires was close to the Massachusetts rate of 4.7 percent, and in September 2024, the county's unemployment rate was 3.4 percent. The last time Berkshire County's unemployment rate was over 4 percent was in 2021 (4.9 percent), and the highest this decade was 9.4 percent in 2020. “It’s pretty comparable, and anything under 5 percent unemployment is considered full employment, which means that there are job opportunities for people who are looking, and it’s still keeping the economy going,” Boulger said. Some level of unemployment is natural, Boulger said, adding that “a small amount of unemployment allows companies to hire and prevents labor shortages.” Boulger, who has been working in the field for almost 35 years, said that the workforce goes through ebbs and flows. She added that Massachusetts has stable labor participation and fairly strong economic conditions, but did cite recent job losses in retail, manufacturing and food service sectors. Guin Griswold, director of employment services at Molari Employment and Healthcare Services in Pittsfield, said that while AI is changing the hiring process, it is not yet being used locally to substitute for actual workers. Griswold said that she has seen a slowdown in the job market and that some people are passively looking for work — meaning they are currently employed and not necessarily applying for jobs, but are keeping an eye out for a better fit or their next opportunity. She added that toward the end of the year, a lot of people get hired for companies they were temping at, as companies want to meet certain numbers by the end of the year. Boulger said the pandemic reset the economy at all levels, impacting every industry and changing workforce dynamics. In the past five years, the Berkshires have lost about 2,000 people in the labor force, she said, adding that many job seekers want more virtual or remote opportunities. “I think job seekers have a different expectation than they did five years ago,” Boulger said. Boulger said that challenges facing the workforce include job growth, AI integration, skill gaps, worker well-being and workplace culture. A population decrease has also impacted the workforce as 22- to 45-year-olds are migrating out of the region. There are more than 3,000 jobs currently open in the area, Boulger said, adding that businesses are struggling to find skilled workers. The MassHire Career Center and Workforce Board are working to develop training programs and career pathways to get people the skills they need to fill those gaps. Artificial intelligence has also changed the hiring process in the region. Boulger said that most candidates are adapting to get noticed in the initial job screening process, and MassHire is helping people prepare their resumes. “It seems like a very impersonal process,” she said. “A lot of our employers are still using AI to help prescreen candidates." In the Berkshires, the largest and fastest-growing employer is health care and social assistance, Boulger said. She also highlighted educational services, retail trade, accommodations, manufacturing and the food service industry. Molari Employment and Healthcare Services office in Pittsfield works to recruit home health care providers and connect them with clients. Griswold said that direct care workers are always in demand, something she deals with firsthand with Molari’s home care agency and its clients. “We could bring [10 direct care workers] in tomorrow, and we’d have them all placed by next week,” she said of the agency that has been in business since 1983 staffing and recruiting home health care providers. Helping younger workers find jobs is also a priority, as unemployment in that age group has risen. In November, the national unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds climbed to 10.6 percent, the highest since 2021, according to CNN. Boulger said that MassHire has internship programs at the high school and college level, along with programs for young adults that connect them to career pathways in health care, manufacturing, clean energy and education. Even with unemployment ticking up, workforce leaders say the region’s challenge is less about job availability than ensuring workers have the skills — and expectations — to meet a changing economy.

Title: Nvidia's AI empire: A look at its top startup investments | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.” Anthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. Cursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Crusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the ‘Stargate’ project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI’s workloads. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Black Forest Labs: Nvidia participated in a $300 million Series B for the German startup behind the “Flux” image generation models in December. The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining. Uniphore: In October, Nvidia joined fellow tech giants AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks to lead a $260 million Series F round into this Business AI company. Uniphore’s multimodal platform helps enterprises automate complex workflows and deploy “AI agents” across customer service, sales, and marketing. Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sakana raised another $135 million at a $2.65 billion valuation in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in a $203 million funding round for the self-driving delivery startup. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December 2024, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Hippocratic raised another $126 million at a valuation of $3.5 billion in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. The startup raised another $115 million in November 2024, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. In September, Nvidia reportedly spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and staff while licensing its technology, in a deal structured as an “acquihire.” Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg. This post was first published in January 2025.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.” Anthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. Cursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Crusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the ‘Stargate’ project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI’s workloads. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees.

Title: Apple needs a visionary QB again: It’s past time for game manager Tim Cook to hand off the ball

Full Content:
Update font size. Reset In American football, a “game manager” quarterback is one who protects the ball, executes the playbook, and keeps the scoreboard ticking through steady, conservative play. Tim Cook has been precisely that for Apple: an operations maestro who took the reins from the legendary Steve Jobs in 2011 and transformed the company into a financial juggernaut, ballooning its market cap from $350 billion to over $4 trillion through supply-chain efficiency, massive stock buybacks, and incremental refinements of products created under Apple’s visionary co-founder Steve Jobs. Yet, as Jobs himself might have envisioned, Cook was never meant to be the long-term playmaker — the electrifying, risk-taking, charismatic visionary who redraws the field with bold, game-changing innovations. Jobs built Apple on “insanely great” breakthroughs: the Mac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Under Cook’s stewardship, however, the company has increasingly relied on iteration rather than revolution, neglecting opportunities in AI (like the long-stagnant Siri), launching underwhelming entries like Vision Pro in rushed form, and prioritizing financial engineering over audacious product leaps. Nearly 15 years into his tenure — one far longer than Jobs likely intended for a transitional “caretaker” CEO — Apple stands at a crossroads. With executive departures signaling the end of an era and succession planning accelerating, it’s time for Cook to step aside. The world’s most valuable company deserves a charismatic, exciting leader once more: a true visionary capable of reigniting the magic that made Apple not just profitable, but culturally unstoppable. Richard Waters for Financial Times: ‎ The Financial Times’ report that succession planning at Apple is now in high gear makes it seem increasingly likely that the pre-eminent consumer tech company will soon be under new management. Strong demand for the iPhone 17 lifted Apple’s stock market value past $4tn for a while over the past month. With a strong tailwind from the huge stock buybacks that Cook instigated as one of his first acts as chief, the share price is up 20-fold from the day he took over in 2011. But, with artificial intelligence threatening the biggest upheaval to the tech world in decades, Cook will also leave huge questions. His successor will need to demonstrate a stronger appetite for risk and a willingness to bet on a new vision for how technology can reshape people’s lives… His successor will need to show that they can both co-opt AI to reinforce what Cook built while also harnessing its disruptive potential to ride the next consumer tech wave. The botched launch of Apple Intelligence — key parts of which were delayed early this year — was worrying. How much that will matter in the long run is hard to tell… But there are obvious risks to taking a back seat in the AI revolution. If LLMs are at the centre of innovation, then acting merely as a rent collector while leaving it to others to define the next must-have digital experiences would put Apple in an uncomfortable position. Also, if LLMs come to represent what is essentially a new operating system, they will have strategic importance. Hopefully, the days of a COO masquerading as an Apple CEO are finally drawing nigh. Apple deserves a visionary leader who can once again drive relentless, world-changing product innovation. – MacDailyNews, December 9, 2025 The Vision Pro headset represented his biggest gamble on a new device… But as a compelling vision of how mixed-reality headsets will change your life — the kind of thing that Steve Jobs excelled at — it was a flop. Instead, Meta has stolen a lead with a more lightweight, fashion-conscious range of “smart” glasses… Apple’s next chief will need to increase the scale of the company’s bets. Among the first jobs: convincing its shareholders, who have become accustomed to the iPhone’s steady profits, that it is time to look beyond Tim Cook’s gravy train. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: As our own SteveJack wrote last July: Steve Jobs famously said of Tim Cook, “Tim is not a product person, per se.” That has turned out to be an understatement, especially with the fact that the Apple Watch, AirPods, and even the Vision Pro concept began under Jobs. I’ve closely observed Apple for decades and I believe that Steve Jobs never meant for Tim Cook to be Apple’s CEO in 2025. When Jobs handpicked Cook as his successor in 2011, many believed it was a strategic move to stabilize the company during a tumultuous transition following Jobs’ untimely death. However, I contend that Jobs intended Cook to serve as a short-term CEO, a 3-5 year placeholder to mollify investors, not to lead Apple for nearly a decade and a half, stagnating its innovative spirit, jettisoning innovative executives, while relying on financial engineering, mainly in the form of hundreds of billions of dollars in buybacks, to prop up the company’s success. Jobs, a visionary known for his relentless pursuit of groundbreaking products, built Apple into a cultural and technological titan with the Mac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. His genius lay in anticipating consumer needs before they did. Cook, hired from Compaq in 1998 as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations, was the operational mastermind behind Apple’s supply chain efficiency, going all-in on CCP-controlled China to maximize Apple’s profit margins. Jobs clearly valued Cook’s logistical prowess, but I believe Jobs saw Cook as a caretaker, not a long-term visionary, expecting him to maintain stability for a few years until a product-focused, visionary successor emerged. Under Cook, Apple’s market capitalization soared from $376 billion in 2011 to over $3.9 trillion in early 2025 making it the world’s most valuable company (it has since shed some $800 billion over the year, falling to third place behind Nvidia and rival Microsoft). Yet, much of this growth stems from financial engineering, service expansions like iCloud and Apple Music, and a steady stream of annual incremental product updates, rather than revolutionary Jobsian innovation. The Apple Watch, AirPods, and Vision Pro were initiated under Jobs’ tenure, with their completion coming during Cook’s tenure. The Apple Car project, also conceived by Jobs, was abandoned after a long, chaotic, and costly period under Cook. It’s clear that Cook lacks the disruptive, charismatic spark Steve Jobs infused throughout Apple. Basically, all of Apple’s successes under Cook are iterations of Steve Jobs’ products and services. Cook’s lack of hands-on product involvement has slowed innovation, with half-baked products like the Vision Pro being launched to consumers too early and, unsurprisingly, failing to sell. Apple clearly missed the generative AI (GenAI) paradigm shift under Cook and has been struggling to catch up ever since. Steve Jobs likely would not have released the Vision Pro and visionOS in the condition they were launched under Tim Cook. Jobs very likely would have not neglected Siri (which he purchased) for over a decade and a half and would almost certainly have foreseen GenAI early. Very likely, Jobs focus on Siri would have led him and Apple to GenAI first. Visionary Jobs’ main focus was about creating “insanely great” products; Cook’s seems to be about iteration and other, side pursuits. If Jobs intended Cook as a relatively short-term placeholder, the question remains: who was meant to follow? Speculation points to figures like former software chief Scott Forstall — who Cook rather quickly forced out of the company, ostensibly over the botched Maps launch (which way okayed by Cook, by the way) – and head product designer Jony Ive, who left Apple after years of feeling unchallenged under Cook. Jobs highly valued both executives, even granting Ive more operational power than Cook at the time of his death. Today, Ive is collaborating with OpenAI on a potentially revolutionary AI product, not working for Apple. The departure of these executives, whether explicit or tacit, conveniently solidified Cook’s long-term hold on the CEO role. While Cook’s canned-video tenure has been financially stellar overall, Apple has for many years coasted and thrived on Jobs’ lingering momentum, propped up by Cook’s beige operational savvy and financial engineering. After Cook’s tenure finally, blessedly ends, only time will reveal if Apple can rediscover its Jobsian revolutionary edge. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Instead, Meta has stolen a lead with a more lightweight, fashion-conscious range of “smart” glasses…” the Vision Pro is NOT a flop. it’s spectacular technology that’s very much a Version 1 (/developer) device. a lot of apple’s new tech was a ‘flop’ at launch, and then iterated over time into successful mass market products. the Vision Pro represents such a leap forward that a bold new less consumer-friendly opening salvo was necessary to start the wheels turning. eventually the technology will evolve into a viable next generation product. A product may be cool & advanced, but if it represents 8% of the market, it’s not sustainable and in business terms, it’s a flop. From the beginning, AAPL forecasted 3 million units for the first year, but early sales estimates landed around 200,000 units. Flopping early. When a WEARABLE item is notoriously uncomfortable, in-spite of offering a magical experience when using, it’s a blunderous flop. Jobs would have breathed flames on just this one aspect alone. Easy to discern (pain), relatively easy to fix, but still released! From what I gather, someone with needed acute standards, could make AVP market-relevant. This is just one products during Cook’s term that was befuddlingly mishandled. Siri agrees, as she knows. You are correct John. My Vision Pro was only used sporadically since I bought it (lots of travel and caregiving for family) in late 2024, but over the past few weeks i’ve been using it daily and I am astounded at how much the experience has improved. Little things are better like the digital crown now being able to control either environment immersion or volume depending on which icon you are looking at. And big things like pass-through video quality noticeably improving, eye tracking and gestures being even more accurate and being able to view my iPad Pro as a giant display (like Mac Virtual Display but without widescreen options). Obviously price was always going to be a limiting factor but issues like bulk or discomfort have been massively overblown. Apple had to get this product out into the wild in order to start iterating on it and improving it through real-world use. Even in 2026 this is bleeding-edge tech that’s a marvel to experience. The technologies developed for the Vision Pro will trickle down to more consumer friendly (and less exciting) glasses. By the end of the decade I expect the Vision Pro to look more like 80s visor-style sunglasses that you can quickly slip on and off (perhaps still with an external battery or tethered to a Mac/iPad). My primary complaints against Vision Pro is the poor marketing. It was never meant to be a pair of smart glasses that you walk around in, that’s a separate product category that we may see a preview of later this year. Vision Pro is an immersive portal into your digital world primarily for use at home or work. Your email address will not be published.

Title: How Some Newsrooms Are Defying the Industry Odds

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Even as layoffs ravaged newspapers, magazines and TV networks in 2025, journalism leaders reveal why they’re bullish about the future Axios CEO Jim VandeHei declared last month that we’re living in a “post-news” era, a world shaped by personalized content that allows people to create their own realities. “America’s information ecosystem is badly broken, deeply polluted and increasingly dangerous,” he wrote. Yet despite that sobering conclusion, and following a year in which many news outlets, including Axios, cut jobs, VandeHei told TheWrap he felt confident about the future. “I actually go into next year probably the most bullish I’ve been for high-end media in five years,” he said. The numbers would suggest otherwise. Sweeping layoffs throughout the broader media industry reached new heights in 2025, according to the executive staffing firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. The media industry — measured by television, news, film and streaming — announced 17,163 job cuts this year as of November, up 18% from the same period last year and ahead of the total 15,039 in 2024. It has felt like no one is immune. Throughout 2025, TheWrap chronicled cuts at legacy newspapers (Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Chicago Tribune), magazines (People Inc., Penske Media, Condé Nast), digital media companies (Vox Media, Business Insider) and TV networks (CNN, CBS News, NBC News). This slashing of jobs reflects a yearslong crisis gripping the media industry, in particular news, as it faces challenges stemming from shifting consumption habits toward creator-led programs, the threat of generative AI platforms siphoning away traffic from news websites, a retreat of ad spending and industry consolidation. It’s forced some journalists to figure out which options remain in a beleaguered industry and how best to serve audiences as attention spans have splintered. There are some bright spots: News-specific cuts were actually down last month (2,254) compared to the same period last year (4,537), according to Challenger, Gray and Christmas, and successful startups, like the Congress-focused Punchbowl News and center-right Bulwark, are growing. MS NOW (formerly MSNBC) staffed up in 2025 as it split from NBC News, while the California Post, a West Coast extension of the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post, is building a newsroom for its 2026 launch. Still, given the grave challenges facing the industry as a whole entering the new year, TheWrap spoke with leaders of growing media organizations about what they see that’s working. “I feel very confident that if you are a media company that produces distinct content, either because of your expertise or because of the personalities that you have on payroll, that business is getting better and better,” VandeHei said. As many of the nation’s top newsrooms retreat, a collection of outlets found ways to expand. Politico founder Robert Allbritton gave $20 million to his nonprofit, the Allbritton Journalism Institute, in 2023 to create a nonprofit newsroom, NOTUS (News of the United States). Its mission was to produce “empathetic and brutally honest” reporting on Congress and Washington by pairing a group of 10 fellows, or reporters in training, with a staff of seasoned reporters for two years. NOTUS has since drawn from the ranks of Politico, Axios, the Daily Beast and NPR, and has reported exclusively on Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s presidential ambitions and on fake citations in a report published by the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-led Health and Human Services Department. The site has rotated through the White House’s “New Media” seat during its press briefings, with one NOTUS reporter getting on Donald Trump’s radar in May. In addition, its first class of 10 fellows “graduated” from the program earlier this year, with some landing jobs at Bloomberg, Politico, the Miami Herald and other top outlets. “Everyone who wanted a journalism job has gotten a journalism job, and a good journalism job,” NOTUS editor-in-chief Tim Grieve, a former top editor at Politico and National Journal, told TheWrap. Grieve said the newsroom now operates as a for-profit entity, though all profits are sent back to Allbritton’s institute. Some of those NOTUS’ donors support the website, he said, due to its new “Washington Bureau Initiative,” which assigns NOTUS fellows to report on state congressional delegations in 12 states, including New York, California, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Grieve called the decline in local reporting “a real crisis for journalism and for democracy.” “Most local newspapers, the ones that used to have Washington bureaus, mostly don’t anymore, and so there’s really no one out there keeping tabs on the specific members of a state delegation for the readers back home,” Grieve said. Axios, meanwhile, has consistently expanded its Axios Local initiative, which has created 34 news arms since its launch in 2020 in cities such as Miami, Atlanta, Portland and Boston. VandeHei, Axios’ CEO, plans to expand the program to areas including Colorado and Ohio next year, bringing the total to 41 by early next year. VandeHei told TheWrap the current collision of technology and reporting has allowed news outlets to break into local markets more efficiently than they could five years ago, and he wanted to “perfect” the local model by the end of 2026. “If we could fix local, which I think is the hardest problem to fix, and we could do that at scale, I think that would be a great gift to society,” VandeHei said. “I think local news is really important, and I think it’s a really hard business, and if we can crack that code, I would feel really good about life.” Axios, which was bought by Cox Enterprises in 2022, has also expanded into video once again through the first season of “The Axios Show,” a one-on-one conversation series between Axios journalists and newsmakers that highlights their perspectives. Its first season guests included Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and VandeHei said “it looks like” there would be a second one. Axios is also testing a video component to its “Behind the Curtain” column, authored by VandeHei and co-founder Mike Allen. “We’re pretty great at convening and getting really interesting people on camera doing good interviews,” VandeHei said. “So that’s a good business.” VandeHei, who had to cut 19 staffers last year at Axios, acknowledged the “painful and awful” reality of those layoffs. But he said that media companies needed to adapt quickly if they wanted “to be able to last forever.” “It’s going to be the hard part for all companies and all employees in basically every industry,” VandeHei said. “Going forward, you’re just going to have to be more agile and just realize that reality is what reality is. Things are just shifting faster than at any point in humanity, and you just have to find ways as a business and as an individual to keep up and to evolve, and that makes people nervous.” Grieve, the NOTUS editor, said the company has experimented with AI to support some of its backend models, but it wasn’t considering following other news outlets’ lead in licensing its content to companies like OpenAI or Amazon or using the technology as a substitute for reporting. “AI cannot tell you what is in the head of a politician working on Capitol Hill or what his next move is going to be,” Grieve said. “But great reporters can do that, and as someone who’s hired a ton of journalists over the years, I know how hard it is to find people who can truly break news and deliver information that people don’t have.” Axios struck a content licensing deal with OpenAI in January 2025, joining a collection of other media outlets, but it does not use ChatGPT to produce stories. VandeHei said outlets that’ve experimented with AI to generate stories were engaging in a “stupid strategy” that wasn’t distinctive enough to stand out from human-generated work. The future for outlets that seek to rise above the threats posed by technological advancements and shifting consumer habits, VandeHei said, is to report out “distinct, unique, human, verified” journalism that can stand apart from those that try to appeal to a generic audience. He singled out Punchbowl News and The Information, both of which cater to insider audiences, as well as giants like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal that have managed to convert a specific audience into devoted, paying subscribers. “I would tell anybody in any industry, buckle up,” VandeHei said. “The hypervolatility is here, and it will only intensify.”

Title: The 14 Global Trends That Will Shape the Climate in 2026

Time Published: 2026-01-02T12:30:21Z
Full Content:
The world is now moving into the latter half of a critical decade to fight climate change. Scientists have warned that nations need to cut carbon emissions nearly 50% by 2030 to stave off 1.5C temperature rise. The world is woefully off track to meet those targets and risks further backsliding, even as there are some surprising sources of progress. In the US, those tensions are on full display. The future of the energy transition is being shaped by President Donald Trump’s climate policy rollbacks that favor fossil fuels — but also the life support for renewables and batteries paradoxically coming from data center power demand. Read more: Some Good Climate News to End the Year China’s role as the world’s biggest emitter and hub for green tech are also affecting efforts to curb carbon pollution. This year, the country will set a new plan laying out how climate fits with its economic ambitions, while its booming clean tech sector is expected to help more developing countries adopt renewable energy and electric vehicles. Here are 14 themes Bloomberg News writers are keeping tabs on in 2026. Climate Clues in China’s New Economic Blueprint When Chinese officials gather in March for annual legislative meetings, they will approve the country’s next five-year plan. Climate watchers will be looking to see if the plan does anything to speed up the pace of decarbonization after Beijing set what’s widely seen as a conservative 2035 climate target last year. The key stat to watch for is China’s target for carbon intensity — that is, a measure of how much it emits per unit of GDP. It’s currently off track of its last five-year plan created in 2020. How much policymakers push to close the gap will be a critical litmus test for China’s climate leadership amid global backpedaling. —Lili Pike Can Diplomats Make Headway at COP31? International negotiators will spend much of this year trying to create a bare-bones road map to phase out fossil fuels and another to eliminate deforestation. The two issues were left unresolved at the COP30 climate summit in Brazil last year. But with the nation in control of the COP presidency this year, it has a chance to make progress. The first key milestone will be a conference in Colombia in April focused on phasing out fossil fuels. Negotiators will continue to hash out their differences at the Bonn Climate Change Conference in June, as well as at London and New York’s climate weeks held in June and September, respectively. The world’s efforts will culminate at COP31, which will take place in Antalya, Turkey, in November. —Laura Millan Look to Developing Countries for Climate Progress In recent years, there have been breakout climate success stories in developing countries, largely enabled by cheap Chinese clean tech exports. Bangladesh off-grid home solar installations set a record globally, enabling rapid rural electrification. Pakistan’s huge purchase of solar panels and batteries have led the country to abandon natural gas as a strategic fuel. And Ethiopia’s de facto ban on fossil-fuel car imports has led to a surge in electric vehicle sales. These transitions were largely driven by access to Chinese technology. With the country’s green exports increasing, expect more such stories to emerge in 2026. —Akshat Rathi The Clean Tech Revival Continues Global climate tech investment made a comeback in 2025, largely driven by growing data center energy demand. The surge is likely to continue this year, with both nascent nuclear technologies and proven renewable solutions set to draw investor interest. Upgrading the power grid is likely to see continued investments as well, giving a boost to everything from battery energy storage to power management software. But questions remain about whether the artificial intelligence boom can continue to sustain the climate tech sector, and how to bring growth to companies beyond the energy ecosystem. —Coco Liu Nuclear Energy’s Boom Is Just Over the Horizon Data centers are sucking up electricity as fast as new power plants can get built, and Big Tech is willing to throw big money at nuclear. Dozens of companies are working on the next generation of small reactors, and the Trump administration is pushing to streamline the regulatory process and lining up billions in financing for big ones. More than 60 reactors were under construction worldwide at the end of 2025, though the world’s nuclear capacity contracted a bit. Yet even friendly regulations and fat checks can only do so much to accelerate the notoriously slow-moving industry. That means that while the nuclear sector will start to see momentum in 2026, it’s still a few years away from bringing a wave of new plants online. —Will Wade Will the AI Bubble Burst? Last year began with a crash in AI-related stocks after news of Chinese company DeepSeek’s more efficient models threw a wrench in power demand growth projections. Will there be another “DeepSeek moment” in 2026? That’s a question that’s on investors’ minds, even as money keeps pouring into AI and the energy sector. Even if models don’t become more efficient, the bubble could burst in other ways. Already, clean energy and real estate developers are sounding the alarm that electric grids, permitting and regulations aren’t keeping up with the pace of interconnection. Some regions are seeing years-long queues to hook up power projects to the grid, and there are backlogs for the crucial electric infrastructure. If the friction continues, AI investors could find their ambitions thwarted or that they’ll have to rely more on developing power onsite and behind the meter. —Michelle Ma Everyone Wants a Piece of the Arctic “What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic” is a truism that’s become irrefutable. This past year was the hottest in 125 years of records at the top of the planet, and the spill-over effect of that is beginning to be felt everywhere else, from rising seas to an uptick in atmospheric carbon. Rising temperatures also have the world increasingly looking at how to exploit the region. In 2026, expect previously local or regional Arctic issues — from ports to critical mineral development — to become international priorities. They include how China’s push to transport cargo through the Northern Sea Route will impact fragile ecosystems, and whether Trump’s push for the US to take over Greenland becomes more aggressive. —Danielle Bochove The EV Market Splits The global transition to electric vehicles will fracture in 2026, as EV sales slow in the US and scoot ahead in the rest of the world. BloombergNEF expects drivers to snap up 16.9 million EVs globally through September. That would be an increase of 16% over the year-earlier period. The tide of affordable and well-reviewed Chinese machines from companies like BYD and SAIC Motor will help drive the uptick in sales, building on 2025’s rise in exports. The EV outlook is far cloudier in the US, which still largely bars Chinese cars and trucks. The sunset of federal subsidies on EV purchases in September slammed the brakes on electric car adoption in the US. BNEF expects US sales to essentially stay level in the first half of the year and dip in the third quarter, in comparison to the market’s record run in August, September and October of this year. —Kyle Stock What Will New York City Do About BlackRock? Three of the city’s five pension funds are weighing whether to drop BlackRock’s $42 billion mandate because of the asset manager’s climate policies. Former Comptroller Brad Lander made a recommendation late last year after a formal review of all the fund managers overseeing the city’s retirement money, citing BlackRock’s failure to tackle global warming. Lander tried to pass the resolution to cut out the money manager in December, but he was unable to convince pension board of trustee members to hold a vote before the end of the year. Now, it will be up to new comptroller Mark Levine to hold a vote this year. Mayor Zohran Mamdani will also have a significant amount of influence over the outcome of the vote. It will come as BlackRock faces other headwinds: Late last year, the firm lost a mandate with a Dutch pension fund due in part to climate-related concerns. —Olivia Raimonde Climate Risk Modeling Gains Steam Demand is high and growing for accurate, usable climate information, particularly information that can help assess risk. That’s driving researchers to probe every level of risk and solution, from neighborhoods exposed to more frequent flooding, to whether proposed atmospheric cooling approaches can work safely, if at all. The clamor for actionable information comes as the Trump administration tries to dismantle much of the infrastructure in the US that underpins world-leading science. That includes hiding reports and data; cutting staff and funding; and putting out analyses that cherry-pick data downplaying climate change. The next 12 months are shaping up as a fight for more accurate climate information and an increasingly challenging environment to find it. —Eric Roston US Renewables Face a Bumpy Road The boom days for clean energy in the US are over — for now. Trump’s efforts to halt the buildout of solar and wind have resulted in policy and financial headwinds that will continue to be a big challenge for the industry. Large-scale solar installations, while still expected to make up the bulk of all new power plant additions, are forecast to decline as lucrative federal tax incentives start to fade away by mid-year and tariffs raise costs, according to BloombergNEF. Rooftop solar tax credits for homeowners also got wiped out, though leasing panels will still qualify. Wind developers may be even harder off. Subsidies have disappeared, and the Trump administration has thrown up additional permitting hurdles. The one bright spot? Batteries, which can still qualify for tax breaks if they satisfy new rules restricting the amount of materials that can come from China. Data centers are likely to be a strong source of power demand, which could help the industry. And clean energy developers are hopeful that artificial intelligence’s power needs will convince Trump to ease his assault on the industry. —Mark Chediak The EPA’s Biggest Climate Attack Is Coming A process initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency last summer to unravel the federal government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases is set to conclude this year. The EPA is expected to finalize the controversial rulemaking that would rollback the so-called endangerment finding and immediately remove greenhouse gas regulations for passenger cars and trucks. While the administration has rolled back a number of climate rules, this would be the most consequential yet. Any decision to rescind the endangerment finding will undoubtedly be swiftly challenged in the courts, kicking off an epic legal battle that could determine how much the federal government can do to respond to global warming. —Zahra Hirji FEMA’s Fate Will Be Decided The Trump administration spent 2025 weighing whether or not to abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with the president establishing a review council co-chaired by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The group was tasked with providing recommendations on what to do with the agency, which it’s expected to finalize early this year. Disaster researchers, state and local emergency managers, and FEMA staff are all waiting to see how dramatic the proposed reforms will be. Although the president doesn’t hold the exclusive power to dissolve the agency in its entirety — that power rests in the hands of Congress — there’s a lot Trump can change, or at least try to. —Zahra Hirji Can California Meet its Climate Goals? This new year marks the 20th anniversary of California’s landmark climate law that has transformed the Golden State into a green powerhouse. But it’ll spend 2026 fending off the Trump administration’s campaign to dismantle its authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump tax bill’s elimination of federal renewable energy and electric vehicle incentives is already slowing California’s progress toward reaching net-zero emissions by 2045. With the administration trying to scuttle the state’s cap-and-trade market, expect California to continue to spend more time fighting back in the courts and developing workarounds. Beyond Trump’s reach, local and regional California agencies continue to eliminate fossil fuels. A Bay Area ban on the sale of gas water heaters and furnaces, for instance, begins to take effect in 2027 and will apply to a fifth of the state’s population. —Todd Woody Top photograph: Floating solar panels manufactured by Hanwha Solutions Corp. on the Hapcheon Dam in Hapcheon, Gyeongsangnam-do province, South Korea, on Tuesday, Feb. 8, 2022.

“Times are difficult globally; awakening is no longer a luxury or an ideal. It’s becoming critical. We don’t need to add more depression, more discouragement, or more anger to what’s already here. It’s becoming essential that we learn how to relate sanely with difficult times. The earth seems to be beseeching us to connect with joy and discover our innermost essence. This is the best way that we can benefit others.” —Pema Chodron 2026 is the 250th anniversary of our country’s conception. A few years later when the Constitution was ratified, we became a republic — “if you can keep it,” Ben Franklin cracked to anxious citizens waiting outside the great hall in Philadelphia. Our country was predicated on the resolve of virtuous men operating under the rule of law. We are lately under an astounding siege of villains without principle seeking to wreck the republic. The big question facing the USA is whether our political life can become even more deranged than it has been in the past ten years, or can we possibly sober up. How is it we’re still arguing about men in women’s locker rooms? The self-evident has gone missing. A lot has gone very wrong. The Woke-Jacobin war against our country continues, led by a Democratic Party made even more vicious, depraved, and insane by the 2024 election victory of Mr. Trump, who was left a broken polity after the four-year tableau vivant of “Joe Biden.” Can our nation recover its balance, its sense of purpose, its traction in history? Can we reconstruct a coherent common culture that will afford us some means to carry on as an upright people? I will try to answer without wasting pixels. Hijacking the Law Nothing is more urgent than cleaning up the machinery of our elections. It is overloaded now with deliberately devious complexities that invite fraud. We must put an end to mail-in ballots with the sole exception of traditional absentee ballots for citizens out of the country on election day, with proof. We must eliminate all electronic interfaces between the vote and the tally, including all ballot-counting hardware, and return to paper ballots tallied by human beings. We must require voter ID, proof of citizenship, and proof of local voting-district residence. Automatic motor-voter registration must end. Ballots must be cast on election day only (absentee ballots must be received by election day) and the results reported out in twenty-four hours. Clusterfuck Nation is a reader-supported publication.

But, understand that an industry has evolved to take full advantage of that. It’s personified by the Democratic Party-allied lawyer Marc Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, who played a significant role in the legal expansion of mail-in voting that led up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The Democracy Docket org is funded by George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, associated NGOs (the Hopewell Fund, the North Fund) used as pass-throughs for the Arabella Fund, the MacArthur Foundation, and the David Rockefeller Fund. In 2021, Marc Elias founded the Elias Law Group after leaving Perkins Coie, the Washington DC power firm that played a significant role in the RussiaGate crimes centered around Hillary Clinton’s Steele Dossier. At Perkins Coie, in advance of the 2020 election, Elias was extensively involved in challenging, litigating, influencing, and re-engineering state election laws and advised on “dark money” strategies for Democratic voter “outreach” (that is, ballot-harvesting). It was all meticulously gamed-out beforehand by an NGO called the Transition Integrity Project founded by Rosa Brooks of the Georgetown University Law Center. The objective: to maximize opportunities for improper balloting. After the 2020 election, Marc Elias defended the suspicious results from counties in swing states against Trump campaign lawsuits (winning 64 of 65 cases on specious grounds). The last thing Marc Elias has been interested in is election integrity. His focus is strictly on winning elections for the Democratic Party by any means necessary. The war cry about “defending democracy” is the exact opposite of what the lawfare ninjas actually do. Through 2025, Congress has entertained election reform bills, most recently, the SAVE Act (Safeguard American Voter Eligibility), which has languished on the House side for months awaiting deliberation in the Senate. Prediction: Mr. Trump will turn up the heat on Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) to expedite passage of election reform. This partly depends on the dark business now occurring in Venezuela, which is the suspected hub of a global election rigging apparatus engineered around Dominion / Smartmatic technology. Prediction: Marc Elias will be indicted for activities related to election fraud. Norm Eisen is the point man for Democratic party Lawfare, which is warfare against the citizens of the USA by means of the courts. Eisen is affiliated with the Brookings Institution and the States United Democracy Center, which is supported by George Soros’s Open Society Foundation and activist orgs associated with Arabella Advisors, a hub fueled by dark money. He was an active participant in the Transition Integrity Project of 2020. Norm Eisen’s general mission for years is to drain the resources of the Democratic Party’s political opponents in frivolous lawsuits — working in partnership with Democratic activist judges — and to overburden the federal court dockets to paralyze the working-out of our nation’s disputes. Eisen was counsel to Jerrold Nadler’s 2019 House impeachment committee and was involved in the machinations of then-Rep. Adam Schiff with CIA-agent “whistleblower” Eric Ciaramella, Intel IG Michael Atkinson, and NSC staffer Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, who cooked up the Ukraine phone call scheme to impeach Mr. Trump. After “Joe Biden’s” fake election, Eisen was deeply involved in choreographing the scope and format of the House Jan-6 hearings for which the Republican minority was not allowed to choose its own committee members. The committee proceedings were arranged as a prestige docudrama TV show, under the direction of former ABC network president, James Goldstein, hired, in effect, as the producer of a show. The committee destroyed its entire evidence cache after it issued its final report. That’s how much confidence they had in their methods and findings. After that exploit, Eisen acted as a facilitator and strategist for “Joe Biden’s” DOJ in the 2024 Jack Smith Special Counsel prosecutions of Donald Trump, and acted as a go-between for the DOJ in the various New York State cases against Trump and the Fulton County, GA, case brought by DA Fani Willis. All of these actions amounted to election interference — a concerted conspiracy to eliminate Mr. Trump by putting him in prison by way of specious, malicious prosecutions — and, one way or another, they all failed to accomplish their goal. Norm Eisen and Marc Elias, along with their lawfare cohorts Mary McCord, Andrew Weissmann, and Ben Wittes should be subject to prosecution under federal criminal statutes for their wide-ranging activities, including: 18 U.S.C. § 241 (Conspiracy Against Rights); 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (False Statements); 18 U.S.C. § 594 (Intimidation of Voters). The next big hairball is the politicized judiciary, federal judges who consistently interfere in executive actions (the President), a clash between Article II and Article III of the Constitution. It amounts to Democratic Party-designated plaintiffs getting injunctions and restraining orders through partisan judges against policies issued by the White House around deportation of illegal immigrants, firings of federal employees, funding freezes, the termination of “birthright citizenship,” and more. The funding freeze and firing cases were aimed at keeping taxpayer dollars flowing out federal agencies to Democratic Party NGOs and for keeping the so-called “resistance” operators in positions of influence within government agencies at their desks and on the payroll. Many of the NGOs promote activities aimed at dismantling the government and fomenting racial animus. Taxpayers should not have to underwrite that. The president must be allowed to fire employees of the executive branch engaged in slow-motion sedition. These court rulings are choreographed by Norm Eisen’s lawfare operation which has enough money from the aforementioned NGOs and billionaire-funded foundations to bring endless lawsuits in order to gum up the works of governance. The remedy for all this is knotty. The US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) has reversed many lower court rulings, but these are provisional actions, pending the SCOTUS entertaining any particular case decisively in regular session. The myriad cases end up jamming the SCOTUS docket. The net effect is to slow down policy that President Trump was elected to pursue. Federal judges can otherwise be removed only via impeachment by the US Senate, which is a practical impossibility at this time since it requires 60 out of 100 votes and the Republicans hold a mere 53 seat majority out of 100. Perhaps the best remedy is to prosecute the lawfare ninjas who are ginning up all those court cases. Their activities can be framed as a conspiracy against rights (18 U.S.C. § 241). Against whose rights? Against the rights of the people of the US to an executive that is able to discharge its Constitutional duties — to provide for the public safety, to enforce the law, and to carry out foreign policy. Norm Eisen, Marty McCord, and Andrew Weissmann might also be subject to a charge of seditious conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 2384), as when two or more persons conspire to “levy war against the United States. And it is warfare using the mechanisms of the law. Norm Eisen is behaving like a spike protein in the nation’s bloodstream, turning the nation’s immune system, the rule of law, against the nation. Prediction: Norm Eisen and cohorts will be hiring criminal defense lawyers in 2026. Hijacking the Truth “. . . the dirty little secret is that the same people pretending to be fighting fascism are the fascists.” —Sasha Stone The American people have been increasingly subjected to a contrived permission structure that has normalized lying and deceit about everything and anything, leaving every major institution in the land damaged or wrecked. Lying has become the default position of many in authority, and no one has been held accountable for it. Medicine is wrecked due to the dishonest behavior of doctors colluding with the pharmaceutical industry and officials of the Health and Human Services agencies on the Covid-19 op — mandates, lockdowns, lying about efficacy and harms, hiding true remedies, cover-up of the origins of Covid — as well as the medical establishment’s regular ongoing “health care” racketeering operations in concert with insurance companies, hospital conglomerates, and other players. The cruelty and incompetence of these medical rackets is one thing, but the moral failure is spectacular. Medicine has forsaken the Hippocratic oath: First, do no harm. The many agencies under US HHS, plus the university labs, the medical journals, the state medical boards, and the mainstream media’s health reporters are all implicated in these ongoing misdeeds. Until late in 2025, HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr., was sore beset by “resistance” at the FDA, CDC, NIH, and everything else under the giant agency’s umbrella. In December, 2025, things are changing. The CDC’s ACIP vaccine advisory committee stopped recommending Hepatitis B vaccines for newborns. Then the CDC officially acknowledged that COVID-19 vaccines have caused injuries in adults, previously stonewalled. These might be signs that Mr. Kennedy is finally getting a grip on his sprawling agencies. Prediction: in 2026, expect criminal referrals against former senior management at CDC, FDA, and NIH for a range of crimes in the Covid-19 operation. In the larger picture, the whole scaffold of health care is in the process of imploding. Predictions: In 2026, doctors will increasingly bail out of big corporate practices and go freelance on a cash payment basis, leaving behind the corrupt and onerous insurance racket. Hospitals will shutter. Giant medical insurance conglomerates will go out of business. Millions will be left without coverage. Medicine will be forced to begin reorganizing on an emergent, provisional basis. The net effect will be doctors who make less money but control their own medical practices and much more limited access to specialty medicine for the general public, including now-common surgeries like joint replacement and cancer therapies. It will be most difficult for doctors to regain their authority and the esteem of their patients. Alt medical practitioners of every sort will multiply, many on the down-low evading regulation, as sick citizens desperately seek relief from illness while they navigate around the ruins of the old standard medicine. Quackery will flourish and it will be difficult for ordinary people to discern which health care services are of value and which are scams. Higher education is obviously ill. It bargained away its legitimacy by participating in the college loan racket with the equally deleterious overlay of pervasive DEI racketeering (and inevitable lowering of standards). That opened the door for grievance-oriented Marxists, and race-and-gender hustlers to take the curricula hostage — wholesale intellectual racketeering. That, in turn, led to the abolition of truth-telling for the purpose of advancing agendas. Reality on campus became purely transactional and contingent. Free speech was suppressed. All of this was supported by pusillanimous college deans and cowardly university presidents and now they are paying the price. Too many young Americans do not believe that a college degree has value, especially at the price of six-figures in debt. Most colleges and universities are not backstopped by big endowments like the big Ivy League schools and a lot of them will be going out of business in 2026. Graduate schools and PhD programs will be especially hard hit. It’s not clear what role artificial intelligence (AI) will play in paring down the numbers of candidates for certified expertise, but it’s not looking good. Any earnest young person can already find an adequate education post-secondary education on the internet, for instance the Khan Academy, a long-running, pre-AI, free website of courses from the rudimentary to the advanced. The arts and the cultural media (including news media) have been disgracing themselves frantically for years. Film production in Los Angeles dropped 63-percent in 2024 extending into 2025. The feature film is being replaced by short-format Instagram and Tiktok videos. The multiplex cinemas are empty. The theatrical exhibition of movies is on its deathbed. They can’t compete with giant flat-screens in the comfort of your home where microwaved popcorn is only a buck a bowl (compared to $32 at the cineplex.) Management of the Hollywood studios was taken hostage by race-and-gender hustlers, with permission structures engineered by financial reliance on Chinese (CCP-affiliated) investors and distributors. The result was Woke cinema, girl-boss movies, DEI-oriented storytelling, and one flop after another. The replication of streaming channels has only invoked Gresham’s Law in culture: bad content drives out good content. The next development, moving very rapidly now, is AI applied to cinema, which implies the end of the acting profession at least, and perhaps screenwriting, too. The end product is liable to be something more like an hallucination than a story told in the language of dramaturgy, following the logic of authentic human behavior. I’d expect even more corrosive effects of Gresham’s Law in the new AI regime as genuine human creativity becomes ever more mediated and abstracted from the end product. You must also wonder about the long-term prospects of the Internet as we know it. The sheer stress on the electric grid from the demands of AI suggests problems with reliable electric service in the years ahead. The whole thing begins to look like a self-limiting problem. Ten years from now, we might be back to entertaining ourselves with puppet shows. News as we knew it for much of the past 200 years is also gone missing. The remnants exist on cable channels and internet sites as a commerce in gossip, rumor, and opinion. The legacy TV news channels no longer employ reporters in the field. Even under Bari Weiss’s new management, CBS’s 60-Minutes still broadcasts rafts of mendacious propaganda each week. “X,” formerly Twitter, is a colossal grape-vine, and is now touting itself as the world’s leading news source, though it still engages in surreptitious censorship. These days, you must be your own gatekeeper (managing editor), combing through bales of crap to find the scattered gems of real news. The authoritative, trustworthy editors of yore are no more. Hardly anyone in the public arena speaks with authority, and reputations are easily assassinated by interested parties with agendas. The newspapers have made themselves pathetic jokes — The New York Times with its Pulitzer Prize for lying about RussiaGate and routine spin services for the corrupt Democratic Party. . . The Washington Post acting as publicist for nefarious cabals in and around the intel blob. Local newspapers lie dead everywhere, and hardly anyone knows what is going on in their own towns. The people are horrifically misinformed and uninformed. Don’t expect AI to make the situation any better. The years ahead may therefore be a nadir of public confusion, delusion, and generalized ignorance in societies whose complexity cannot survive such derangements. What was not so many decades ago a high trust society based on a coherent common culture and broadly agreed-upon values seems to be devolving into babel and anarchy leading eventually to a generalized social collapse. Out of that, a new consensus about reality will emergently and eventually self-organize, but it’s impossible to say how long that might take, what degree of disorder will have to be endured on the journey to resolution, and what the reorganized template for human behavior might finally look like. Humans organized in societies need the truth. They need trustworthy authorities. Authority without truth is just cruel, faithless power. The Democratic Party in our time has given you a nice demonstration of how that works. The party deserves to be put out of business. Perhaps that will begin the process of reconstructing a coherent common culture. War is Politics by Other Means “The self-described Coalition of the Willing was always little more than a public relations exercise. Today – after almost four years of bloody fighting – it is evident that the main concern of this Coalition is to limit the damage caused by its posturing.” —Frank Furedi Interested parties in the USA and the NATO deliberately started the Ukraine War in 2014 while transforming that sad-sack nation into a global money laundry. The reasons appear to have been nefarious and reckless. By Christmas 2025, Mr. Trump’s attempts to negotiate a peace had not succeeded. Even now, the big dogs of NATO make noises and idle threats about going to war with Russia. The rationale for that is preposterous, since they lack the military manpower and the armaments to prosecute such a war, and open themselves to nuclear destruction if they even attempt such a folly. The USA, at this point, has no vested interest in Ukraine. It is in everybody’s interest that the Ukraine revert to its pre-2014 condition as an uncontested frontier nation within Russia’s sphere of influence that does not make itself a pain-in-the-ass for the lands adjacent and proximate to it. It is very much in the USA’s interest to develop respectful, transactional relations with Russia a nation which, paradoxically, under Vladimir Putin, is making itself a last bastion of Western Civ while the EU nations commit economic and cultural suicide, make war on their own citizens, and beat a path to some grim, neo-medieval future. At this moment, there are three plausible endings to the Ukraine War. One is a simple armistice, a cessation of military operations, but without any formal peace settlement. That would look like the long and contentious irresolution of the Korean War, a suspended animation of hostilities at the current battle lines. A second potential outcome is a straight-up Russian victory, leaving Russia to pick up the pieces of what will be a failed state, will require Russia to take administrative control and rebuild what can be afforded, perhaps with international help, or not, and to see if Ukraine can stand on its feet as a sovereign state — understood to not be subject to outside manipulation. That is apt to be the outcome when money and arms from the West stop flowing into Ukraine, which is about exactly where things stand on New Year’s 2026. Mr. Trump appears to want out of supporting a war that Ukraine is clearly losing at this point. The EU’s option of underwriting the Ukraine war machine by confiscating Russian financial assets trapped in Europe’s banks was eight-sixed by Hungary and Belgium just after Christmas. Confiscating Russia’s sovereign wealth would have probably destroyed Europe’s bond markets and blown up the entire financial system of Western Civ. Europe’s economies are in enough trouble as it is, with industry failing, energy resources getting scarcer and less affordable, and social welfare systems under a mighty strain — not to mention the demographic fiasco of falling indigenous birthrates and the ongoing invasion of so many migrants from the global south. The third possible outcome of the Ukraine mess is that the Ukrainian people themselves will opt out of the war by getting rid of the Zelenskyy regime. Zelenskyy is already engulfed in a scandal over all the money that he and his cronies creamed off out of US and NATO financial support. Also, Ukraine has lost 10-million in population since the start of hostilities in 2022, more than a million of them soldiers killed in action. The lack of young men on the scene is an economic and demographic disaster. The Ukrainians know that Zelenskyy is a criminal as well as an incompetent war commander. They are sick of war, of carnage, of wreckage and ruin. Forecast: Zelenskyy will be ousted as president by elite Ukrainian military units before the four-year anniversary of the war’s onset in February. Ukraine then concedes the loss of its territories. . .the war ends. . . and Russia supervises an election at the earliest opportunity. The world moves on. Euroland Cracks Up Europe’s days as a tourist theme park draw to a close. A new era dawns: the Neo-medieval. The ancient competition for power and resources between language groups and geographic regions heats up again, with even fewer goodies to fight over this time around. EU-style cooperation breaks down. The Big Dogs (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands) can no longer stand the grotesque over-regulation of their businesses and their energy needs. They withdraw from the EU and the union dissolves in a matter of weeks. Hard borders are reinstated. Old currencies reappear: the franc, the mark, the guilder, lira. Diplomats make frantic rounds to renegotiate trade agreements and financial arrangements, including how to deal with the many failed European banks and the broken bond markets. Skirmishes break out along contested national frontiers and the sea lanes become danger zones. Meanwhile, Europe’s people endure a severe slowdown in all business activity, loss of pensions, a broken social safety net, and a gross loss of trust in the political class. Populations grow restive. Indigenous Brits, Frenchmen, Germans, finally express their pent-up resentment with third world migrants and a movement grows to expel as many as possible back to their nations of origin. That sparks a violent response from the migrants, especially the jihad-inclined Islamists. It blossoms into medium-grade urban warfare. Militaries are called in to clean out the migrant ghettos and deport non-citizens. It is a high-tech Reconquista, but much more difficult than previous episodes on the continent, bloodier and less successful. In some localities, migrants gain the upper hand by sheer numbers. It could take decades to resolve this, if at all. There is even the possibility that some countires will be overtaken by Islam. The UK is a candidate for that. It has already shown abject submission, and it’s not going too far to imagine the Islamic population could attempt the extermination of native Britons. Many of their imams say as much out loud, one way or another, and the demoralized Brits do nothing about it If hostilities break out, I would not expect the USA to come to Europe’s rescue this time around. America is already showing signs of dissociating from Europe and NATO. It is in the NATO by-laws, for instance, that America is not obliged to defend countries that militate against support free speech, and there are already multiple aggressive censorship programs enacted around the continent. “X” was just fined $140-million by the European Commission for refusing to censor so-called “hate speech” — which is any sundry utterance that some low-level European bureaucrat deems offensive. Prediction: Macron, Merz, Starmer will be run out of office in the coming year one way or another. It will look a little like the year 1848 all over again, when revolt broke out all over the continent. The Marxists will be very active and aggressive, as ever, but they will ultimately lose. Nobody really wants to try communism again. The farmers, especially, have been in the vanguard of protest because of the EU’s onerous and idiotic regulatory regime. 1848 was mainly a revolt of urban industrial labor — the workers! Industry in 1848 was a pretty new thing at the grand scale. The deleterious effects on the laboring class came on quickly and had become too terrible to ignore. It reached a critical threshold before authorities were prepared for it. The next revolution will resolve initially into systems collapse, deep economic contraction, and continued population decline. Generalized, intractable hardship will become the new normal in Europe. Large nation states might de-consolidate, fracture into smaller autonomous regions, to keep public affairs manageable. Some regions may just get chaotic, and stay that way for a long time. Germany has only been a nation since 1871, prior to which it was a crazy-quilt of kingdoms, grand duchies, principalities, and free cities (e.g., Bremen, Frankfurt, Augsburg, Hamburg). The spectacular failure of liberal democracy in our time could easily usher in a period of autocracy — managers who can expedite problem-solving without the intercession of parliaments — and that might even mean a return to monarchy that actually rules. We thought that humanity had moved beyond that, but history is a prankster. Anyway, the USA will increasingly be an observer of all this from our remove across the Atlantic. For now, we are preoccupied with our own backyard. Return of the Monroe Doctrine A friend writes: “Trump has made the wise (and unavoidable) decision to recognize that we don’t and can’t rule the world, but we can be secure in the Western Hemisphere.” Already, under Mr. Trump, US foreign policy is recalibrating to clean up our own hemisphere — to make things a lot harder for China to surreptitiously colonize South America as a resource depot, to smash the drug cartels that are killing off Americans, bust the mafia-like governments associated with them, and aggressively discourage communist movements where they crop up. The obvious case-in-point just now is Venezuela and its long-running Chavez-to-Maduro regime, accused of hosting CCP operations, meddling in elections via internet fuckery in every place it can install Dominion / Smartmatic machines, offering a platform for Iran to antagonize the USA, expropriating US oil leases, and working hand-in-hand with Cuba’s intel services, Brazil’s Lula da Silva, and Mexico’s drug cartels to wage a new generation of warfare against the USA. Mr. Trump is going after Venezuela hard now. Don’t know how he’s going to bust up the place, exactly, but it’s coming, perhaps even without a whole lot of kinetic action. Prediction: a new government and new rules for Venezuela in 2026. US oil companies come back in and get the stuff back pumping. Venezuela gets the licensing fees, royalties, all above-board. Rule of law returns, including property law. Venezuelans can open businesses again. They send us major league baseball players instead of Tren de Agua gangsters and fentanyl. As a side effect of choking-off Venezuela, Cuba’s communist regime finally falls, too. They have depended utterly on Maduro’s oil and with the tankers blockaded, the island will soon go dark. The Castro brothers are gone. Communism, can no longer rely on their charisma. The current president of Cuba, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, is a nonentity. He will be overthrown in 2026, and for the first time in nearly 70 years, Cuba will be a free society. The election of Javier Milei in Argentina has turned that country back in the direction of economic liberty by severely paring down the size of parasitical government and all the racketeering associated with it that has dragged Argentina down since rise of Juan Peron and Peronism after World War Two. In October 2025, the Trump admin offered to help stabilize Argentina’s currency with a $20-billion currency swap line, conditioned on Milei’s ongoing free market reforms. His reforms will continue in 2026, lifting Argentina yet closer to its former status as one of the world’s richer nations. On December 14, 2025, Chile elected a conservative, Jose Antonio Kast, replacing the leftist government of Gabriel Boric. Kast’s election victory, with a 58-percent margin in the runoff against leftist candidate Jeannette Jara. This was a sharp rejection of Boric’s leftist administration, driven by crime, immigration, and economic dysfunction, leading to a significant rightward shift in Chilean politics. Kast’s victory aligns with a regional trend toward right-leaning leaders in Latin America, emphasizing security and migration controls. President Lula of Brazil represents an ongoing irritant to the USA. With Hugo Chavez and Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, plus the Castro brothers, Lula organized the São Paulo Forum (Foro de São Paulo), a coordination platform for leftist political parties, movements, and organizations. You probably noticed that Lula’s 2020 election showed similar earmarks of fraud as “Joe Biden’s” election in the USA. Unlike “Biden” versus Trump, Lula managed to jail his rival, former president Jair Bolsonaro, whose party has been shattered. Prediction: Trump and Marco Rubio will work hard to neutralize the Foro de São Paulo’s operations across South America. Prediction: they will attempt to spring Bolsonaro from prison in time for the October 2026 election. Prediction: Lula will encounter strong, Trump-induced headwinds in the election. Mr. Trump is leaning hard on President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico to cease support of the drug cartels sending fentanyl into the USA. (Ha! How is that even plausible?) He’s gone as far as threatening to send American troops after the cartels’ headquarters in Mexico, and he imposed a 25-percent tariff on Mexican goods exported to the USA, but the duties were “paused” pending progress on border security and drug cooperation. At least, crossings of illegal migrants through Mexico has been reduced to near-zero on the cusp of 2026. Trump and Rubio would like to think they can work with Sheinbaum. Altogether, President Trump is reawakening interest in the America’s relations with South America after a long coma-like period of official inattention. He can already claim a substantial victory in reinstating American control over the Panama Canal with almost zero fanfare and no negative blowback. China still controls ports associated with the canal. They will probably be encouraged to sell those assets. In 2014, China broke ground symbolically for a new trans-oceanic canal through Nicaragua, estimated cost $50-billion. Since then, nothing has happened with it. The project remains suspended and no construction begun. China might be discerning that further colonialist activity in this hemisphere is a low-percentage, unwelcome move. Rampant Dragons and Rising Suns The far east is now a region of fully modernized sovereign states with high-tech armies, heavy industry, and rising prospects compared to Europe (now headed in the opposite direction), with China the biggest dog in the yard. China’s swift thirty-year lift out of something like 12th Century darkness has been an amazing spectacle, for sure. The USA is deeply intimidated by China’s manufacturing dominance, its technological prowess, and its growing military capability. There’s been plenty of loose talk about China’s “long game” aspiration to acquireNorth America as a resource depot. Sending tens of thousands of military-age men through “Joe Biden’s” open border 2021 to 2025 reinforced that worry. We still don’t know what they are up to here, what they are programmed to carry-out, and what we’re going to do about it. The news media isn’t paying attention to that for now. Many expect China to attempt some form of creeping world domination in the decades ahead. As Martin Armstrong put it (paraphrase): Cycles are a kind of religion in China, and they believe now is their turn in history. Yes, they probably think so. But I tend to view their rapid rise to world power as a self-limiting condition. We Americans know something about how quickly great techno-industrial surges can turn and go to shit. Just look around the midwestern rust-belt. The citizens of Detroit back in 1955 would be astonished at the current condition of what had been the seventh-richest city in the world then. A similar fate might await China, since it still depends so heavily on oil and natgas imports and coal-fired power plants. China also lacks the sturdy body of property law that tends to prevent hot battles over domains and the things of value built on them. For now, that authority is vested in the caprices of the CCP. But you must wonder how much possibly independent authority is lodged in the Peoples’ Liberation Army and its generals. Though the CCP has managed to remain in operation for a long time, it is not necessarily a permanent installation in the human condition. China’s population — which, by the way, is rumored to be well under the 1.4-billion claimed (estimated as low as 775-million now) — has been getting restive as the country’s industry matures and begins to show signs of similar sclerosis as seen in America. The financial condition of the country remains especially sketchy, since the CCP controls the banks and can stage-manage their outward appearances. Inside, Chinese banks are a vast chaos of janky loans based on a collateral of hopelessly crappy, fast-disintegrating high-rise apartments that China’s new middle class was swindled into buying for investment purposes, not to live in. Youth unemployment is trending at around 15-percent now. Prediction: expect more social unrest in China, with a destabilizing effect on the CCP’s ability to control events. The world’s attention tends to be focused on the fate of Taiwan, the island nation that was under direct Chinese mainland rule from 1683 to 1895, after which it was briefly swapped to Japan, who lost it in World War Two. In 1949, Chinese nationalists under Chiang Kai-Shek retreated to the island from Mao Zedong’s communists. It has evolved into a stable democratic republic and a high-tech manufacturing powerhouse. The USA is addicted to Taiwan’s computer chips, but then we are addicted to scores of products and resources from mainland still-communist China, too. It appears that the Trump admin is trying to wriggle out of that dilemma by re-industrializing the USA. Prediction: China, has been playing the long game as usual, and will keep hands-off Taiwan in 2026, while continuing to signal its control over whatever comes in and goes out of the island. China does not want to commit to a financially ruinous war over Taiwan at this moment of financial instability on the mainland. Prediction: The long game doesn’t pan out. This will be Xi Jinping’s last year as leader of China. Economic turmoil will prompt the CCP to replace him, and serial replacements won’t last. China slips and drifts as no one can consolidate power. India slips and drifts too, unable to overcome its predicament of reliance on imported oil and foreign investment. Prediction: Narendra Modi loses his grip on power. India’s economy falters and the subcontinent begins to fracture into regions. All major nations of Southeast Asia struggle to stay afloat on the cheap labor manufacturing boom largely pegged to a wobbling global economy with the US as consumer of the first-and-last resort. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia will all come under a strain in 2026 as their factories idle. Radical groups begin to rise and challenge established power bases. Things go sideways. Global Jihad They’re not subtle about it. Islamic Jihad advertises itself loudly at the local grass-roots level. Imams in the UK, France, Germany, Dearborn (MI), all proclaim that the places they have migrated to will become Muslim-dominated. New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani says he believes in global jihad. For mysterious reasons, this seems to tickle the uber-woke liberals of the Upper West Side who voted for Mamdani. The Jihadis shout about the death of America, the death of Western Civ, the death of all who are not Islamists. It’s woven into the Muslim theology. Muslims who kill “infidels” get super brownie-points in the permission structure of Islam. The west has rolled over for this malevolent nonsense for some years now, and it is all coming to a head in 2026. Prediction: EU nations and the UK will begin deporting recent illegal migrants back to where they came from, starting slowly and accelerating as resistance and violence by the designated deportees (and their allies) make it ever clearer that it is an existential necessity to get them out — and beef up their coastline protections so that new migrants cannot enter. Mostly freelance non-state Jihadis will attempt bloody operations against the property and interests of the deporting nations. They will bomb and massacre inside EU countries (likely here in America, too), and outside America against embassies and corporate property. Prediction: The mass deportations will mark a major turnaround in the West, and will be accompanied by changes in government, including the dissolution of the EU bureaucracy itself. Brussells, Belgium, the EU headquarters city, with a large Muslim population, will be a violent hot-spot. Islamism will begin to be turned back. Street protests only just erupted in Iran after Christmas, and are reaching impressive levels quickly. It’s too early to say where it is going. New Year’s Day, businesses, schools, and government offices were shut down — but, the holiday and all. Growing severe water shortages might be behind the unrest as much as dissatisfaction with decades of mullah rule. Trump and the US Domestic Scene At holiday time late in 2025, after nearly a year of exhilarating and tumultuous Trump 2.0 activity, a dark cloud swept over MAGA and many Trump supporters started gobbling up black pills and getting super-depressed. The assassination of Charlie Kirk tripped a lot of that off. It was a significant event. In a nation where reality is now optional for many groups and individuals, every niche of uncertainty and doubt gets filled with narrative battles that harden fear and paranoia. Oddly, with so much of the Woke Left pimping for Hamas the past two years against Israel, elements of the MAGA Right picked up that gonfalon and ran with it, too — led by podcasters Candace Owens, Nick Fuentes, and Tucker Carlson. Candace put out the idea that Israel killed Charlie, and many others just twanged against Israel on the general principle that Israel showers too much money on congressmen and senators — and that the executive branch is too cozy with the Jewish state — and, of course, Gaza (“Genocide.”) So now, you have both the Wokesters and part of MAGA hatin’ on Israel. A lot of this heat was probably generated by the RINO / NeverTrumper branch of the Republican Party seeking to wrassle back its hegemony over the party’s electoral apparatus from Trump / MAGA forces. Ron DeSantis is the RINO / NeverTrumper stalking horse, with that gang setting-up a potential switcheroo for JD Vance’s expected run in 2028. The bottom line, as advanced by the inimitable “Sundance” writing at The Last Refuge blogspot is that the RINO / NeverTrumper gang actually wants to lose the 2026 midterms so that Mr. Trump will be hamstrung for the remainder of his term. Prediction: MAGA has strategic and tactical capabilities that shouldn’t be underestimated. They will fight hard against their in-party enemies moving through the coming year and the fight will reveal the bad intentions of their enemies. Meanwhile, on the other front, the Trump admin is working hard to sever the NGO revenue lines that support the Democratic Party’s shock troops, Antifa, what remains of BLM, the lawfare ninjas, the From-the-River-to-the-Sea crowd, and assorted cadres of the mentally ill. The DOJ, along with its subsidiary, the FBI, is preparing to go medieval on these groups. AAG Harmeet Dhillon is turning the mojo of her Civil Rights division against anarchists who operated freely under “Joe Biden” — and they will liberally use the “domestic terrorist” tag to make this happen. AAG Dhillon is also keeping pressure on the colleges and universities that permitted Jihad on-campus and will take the federal funding away from the grownups who run these joints — who stand by and do nothing in the face of violence and intimidation. Prediction: Anti-Israel activism has gone as far as it can go and will start tailing off now as Israel’s operations in Gaza rachet down. Hamas is defeated. That’s a plain fact. It’s over over there. The surviving Palestinians will be living under a protectorate that requires them to give up devoting themselves to terror. As averred to previously, Jihad will not be greeted favorably in the USA, whether in Mamdani’s New York City or Ilhan Omar’s Minneapolis. MAGA will screw its head back on and re-focus on our country’s priorities: rebuilding productive infrastructure, carefully dismantling rogue financialization like the colossal IED it is, rescuing the American family from Woke depradations, making the people healthy again, reestablishing a coherent consensus on culture, values, right-and-wrong, and getting violence out of public life. The biggest head-wind that Trump faces, of course, is a sociopathic Democratic Party that will do anything to return to power and resume its racketeering operations. Prediction: In 2026, many of their point-persons, past-and-present, will be headed into a courtroom, possibly to a guilty verdict for conspiracy to overthrow the government and other serious charges, such as election fraud. “Joe Biden’s” blanket pardons will be declared illegitimate by SCOTUS due to the profligate use of the autopen by “JB’s” reckless subordinates (some of whom will also land in court). Higher-ups in the health agencies who took part in the Covid-19 operation will also find themselves in legal jeopardy, including the Covid Pimpernel himself, Dr. Anthony Fauci, if he remains alive. Some military figures such as general Milley will face charges. Nothing less than a comprehensive cleanup will do. If Mr. Trump lets the seditions continue, he’ll be buffaloed for the next three years just like the first time around. It’s possible that he will have to invoke a national emergency in order to overcome the resistance of the lawfare federal judge coterie. And I would not feel too sanguine about the members of Nancy Pelosi’s J-6 House Committee, or Ms. Pelosi herself in connection with the FBI / Democratic Party J-6 fake insurrection prank at the Capitol itself. Justice is coming before the 2026 midterms. Finance and Economy Mr. Trump’s biggest headwind is the ever-jankier finance sector of the US economy, a horrific, mold-like overgrowth that has sickened the country with hyper-complex trickery around debt and capital. Too many faithless promises have been made to pay back debts that will never be paid back. And too much wealth has migrated into a few elite hands on the back of those false promises. Too much collateral is mispriced and over-priced, and the re-pricing is liable to be rather violent. At the top are x-quadrillions of derivative positions — bets that could wreck global banking if they go wrong. Then the overpriced equity markets and the bond markets. If enough of that stuff goes south there will be broken pension funds, very few surviving banks, and what’s left of the Boomer generation gets financially wiped out. This late in the game, it’s hard to see how that can be averted. If it plays out, you will see widespread hardship that makes the Great Depression of the 1930s look like one bad day at the races. Trump & Company know that this debacle is ‘out there’ like a Cat-5 hurricane spinning in the Gulf Stream. They are trying to run a practical work-around program of re-industrializing the country so we can become a production-based society for the broad middle rather than a game-playing economy for the hedge-fund bunch. They are using strong-arm tactics with other nations to get reindustrialization paid-for with foreign investment and tariffs. It’s a tough play because reinvestment and rebuilding can’t happen overnight. It’s a long-game, too. And in the short-term the financial games are getting ready to blow. Much depends on how SCOTUS rules on the president’s Article II power to use tariffs as an instrument of foreign policy. The president claims he has work-arounds in the event that the decision goes against him. If SCOTUS does rule against Trump on tariff power and dismantles what he has put in place in 2025, the markets, banks, and currencies will wobble and crash. Their decision is a game of Russian roulette, and you can be sure they know it. You’ll see headlines such as: SCOTUS Destroys Global Economy. Prediction: SCOTUS won’t dare disable Mr. Trump’s tariff weapon. Decision in early spring. The longer they drag it out, the more potential damage. Let’s say there is some sort of crash in 2026, anyway. The equity markets teeter at super-record highs. There is a complete departure in trendlines between the financial part of the economy and the on-the-ground economy of businesses and services that have become increasingly unaffordable. Cars, apartments, groceries, medical stuff, you know: the basics. So far, reindustrialization remains a plan, a dream. Very few of those factory jobs have materialized and the in the immortal words of the late Tom Petty, the waiting is the hardest part. Sidebar: The Specter of AI A lot of the money in equity markets is pouring into Artificial Intelligence (AI), mainly the insanely overpriced Nvidia. AI is supposed to be the engine of the next tech revolution. I demur. I suspect it will disappoint. It will not make our lives better, it will, at best, just make a lot of common operations in daily life more frustrating by removing humans from the equation; and, at worst, it will destroy the human race. I tend to see it flopping on the ‘at best’ side. Your life has already been made worse by computer interventions in daily life, case-in-point: your attempts to contact a business. Computers cut you off at the pass. . . poorly designed phone “tree” answering programs waste hours of your time before they completely fuck up whatever transaction you attempt: a dinner reservation, a product return, a complaint to the Internet service, an attempt to get your medical lab report. Applied AI will only spread that nonsense into every other available niche in your existence. Nothing will work. No one will answer. And that can only go on so long before you get a revolution, a social collapse, a systems apocalypse, a one-way ticket back to the medieval. Coupla other obvious failure-points in the AI dream: 1) As AI increasingly “trains” on material created by AI, it becomes a self-referential hallucination of false data. You won’t be able to rely on anything it “thinks,” or any task it is assigned to carry out. And that doesn’t include its potential for going rogue and developing evil intentions of its own. And 2) The obvious strain on electric power generation, the grid. Investments in new electric generating capacity may be greater than any economic return from AI, whether the added power is nuclear or something more amazingly new and exotic that hasn’t been invented yet. Plus, AI server requirements are already making electric service unaffordable for everyday people. Economically, the thing begins to look like a mirage, including the titanic investments being made in it. Finally, imagine the psychological effect of generalized AI failure. It will put the basic notion of technological progress into a fatal funk as the human race has to go back to the drawing-board and find some other way to keep economic growth going in a finite world. Anyway, a financial train wreck can take different forms, depending on how the authorities respond to the first tremors. Could be a failure of our currency, the dollar, and steeper inflation, where you have a lot of money that has little value and can’t buy much. Could be a massive deflation in which debt failure is acknowledged and money dissipates, leaving behind a scant supply of money that still has value, but not enough to go around. . . meaning many people are just broke. Stock and bond market blowups will just be manifestations of these basic financial illnesses, failures of faith really. Prediction: We do get a crash in equities and bonds. Mr. Trump has to take on the FDR role in a hurry. It might require yet another kind of national emergency to allow a restructuring of US finance that protects the broad middle class from penury. It will take some luck for Mr. Trump to find a way to accomplish this restructuring, but Donald Trump has experienced this kind of brush with ruin personally and he knows how a calamity like this can be turned around. We’ll have to stand by to see how he plays it, how it plays him, and how history plays him and us. It will have to include novel moves besides just the same old federal reserve money-printing a shuck-and-jive. Prediction: expect real novelties, like abolishing the Federal Reserve altogether and reassigning money-issuance to the US Treasury, using a partially gold-backed dollar. Mr. Trump is already making noises about abolishing the federal income tax altogether. And there’s no question that he would love a chance to severely cut down the size and scope of the federal government so, at least, everyday people can carry on in businesses without many of the onerous regulatory burdens that make everything so difficult now. A financial emergency would require a comprehensive reform of health-care including the dismantling of hospital cartels, insurance behemoths, and all the nonsensical bureaucracy that has turned every doctors’ office into something that looks like the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Oil Scene and Energy Superficially, the numbers paint a sanguine picture, but like the black gold itself, the story lurks below the surface. The US Energy Information Agency shows total US oil production for 2025 at an all-time record high of 13.61-million barrels-a-day (b/d). The agency predicts just a bit under that for 2026: 13.53-million b/d. The US-EIA is traditionally optimistic. Americans want cheap oil and they want lots of it. The shale oil “miracle” has delivered a lotta oil as President Trump might say. We’ve been stupendously fortunate the past decade-and-a-half. Some big howevers, however. Shale oil is very expensive to get out of the ground with horizontal drilling, fracking, trucked-in frack water, chemicals, and special fracking sand. It requires very fancy financing, and the state of finance (that is, lending) generally looks shaky going forward. The oil industry has always been a precarious business. The current price of $57-a-barrel (West Texas Crude) is not high enough to provide a return-on-investment for most operators. Break-even lies between $70-90 a barrel. Lenders are reluctant to lend where there is a poor prospect for return-on-investment. But, of course, Americans demand cheap gasoline and low oil prices destroy the companies that are supposed to deliver the cheap gasoline. It’s a predicament with no easy answer. The current numbers suggest the US has finally entered a production plateau preceding major decline by 2028. The drilling rig count in the Permian Basin in late 2025 was 20 to 25 percent lower than in 2024, from 308 active rigs in 2024 to 246 rigs as of Dec 19, 2025. The Permian Basin accounts for nearly half of all US drilling rigs. The US-EIA also expects the average oil price for 2026 to hover at $55 average, lower than the all-year average $69 for 2025. Prediction: under those circumstances, a lower rig-count will bring some oil company bankruptcies, plus accelerating depletion because Permian Basin shale oil wells decline by 70 percent after the first year and lower rig counts mean fewer new wells to replace that lost production. Drill baby, drill is a nice rallying cry, but it would be years before any production could come out of Alaska’s ANWR fields, if ever. If US oil companies return to Venezuela, global supply will go up and the price of oil could decline further. As for the vaunted green energy revolution, independent analyst Art Berman, refers to this as “Renewable Derangement Syndrome: the belief that an ‘energy transition’ is well underway, despite clear evidence to the contrary. It’s the conviction that solar panels and wind turbines are replacing fossil fuels at scale when, in fact, renewables remain a rounding error in global energy supply.” Gold and Silver These things used to be money for thousands of years. For the past hundred years, the financial authorities called it a “barbarous relic.” Now, gold and silver are back, sort of, but first in the role of messenger. Surely, you’ve noticed that gold zoomed from just over $2600/oz to $4500/oz through 2025, while silver moved from $29/oz to $80/oz just after Christmas 2025. Epic moves (followed by a sharp correction New Year’s week). Supposedly, the silver market is super-agitated by the industrial need for silver in electric cars, robot electronics, and the hardware for AI. That’s part of the story. While there are plenty of technical factors, cycle explanations, and parties still manipulating the market price of precious metals, the main message of the metals must be an apprehension of social and political upheaval ahead. Metals move when people are afraid that the basic social contract is falling apart. . . that war might be coming. Everything in this forecast has spoken of unrest, upheaval, inflection points, and the circulation of elites. Gold and silver are what people turn to when they lose confidence in the institutions that stand behind money, namely governments and central banks. They also lose trust in things that purport to represent money. Those things all have counterparties lodged in the agreements around debt. Our debt-based money system is delaminating, with the various layers peeling off into worthlessness: mortgages, loans, bond obligations, etc. The counterparties are the persons or entities who offered the loan and the persons or entity who can’t pay back the loan. When that breaks, when loans don’t get paid back, money vanishes. Gold and silver don’t have counterparties, they just. . . are. They embody the work and energy that went into finding them, digging them out, smelting them, and assaying them, and that’s all. Central banks around the world have been buying up gold and silver with increasing avidity because nations are moving to currencies that are at least partially backed by precious metals. Such a move will severely cut down the issuance of loans, especially loans used to leverage investment positions in other financial instruments — that is, to blow market bubbles. Prediction: sometime in late 2026, gold will arrive at $7,500 and silver will rise to $150 or $200. Paper currencies pegged to nothing but vaporous claims of the full faith and credit of the government, or the backing of an imperial navy, have been the norm for several generations. Sometimes, the bottom falls out of your norm bucket, and you have to make new mental arrangements. In a gold-backed money ecosystem, the opportunities for many kinds of financial legerdemain expire. Swindles are still possible, but as far less complex con-jobs. Further prediction: if this effort fails and paper currencies can no longer be trusted at all, everyday transactions might devolve to circulating silver coin, for a while, anyway, in which case the standard of living will be a whole lot lower for everybody. Bitcoin It is nothing more than the fugazy of all fugazies. It has no essential, discernable, real value. It’s astonishing that it got this far, but it is more complex than a tulip bulb and hyper-complexity appeals to people in finance. It creates evermore opportunities for swindles and frauds. Even if blockchain technology itself has some value, Bitcoin is still a worthless fugazy, sustained only by the general climate of psychosis in finance. As the psychosis lifts, Bitcoin’s value will sink. Prediction: by the third quarter of 2026, Bitcoin is back below $25,000 and headed for extinction. Concluding Notes As usual, apologies for going on so long. 2026 will require more than the usual fortitude, especially for those stuck in conventional investments and who are gurgling under water on mortgages and other loans. On the political front: expect broad and serious prosecutions of many known villains who, one way and another, tried to overthrow the republic since 2016. Unlike just about everybody else in the forecasting business, I don’t believe the Democratic Party will be able to take back the House of Representatives or the US Senate in the 2026 midterms. They have left too wide a slime trail of corruption, avarice, lunacy, and treason. Lastly, a salute to the intrepid President Donald J. Trump, for all his faults, a true American hero.

Pennsylvania saw thousands of workers lose their jobs in 2025 as dozens of companies submitted Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifications to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry this year, informing the state of large layoffs. The closing of Crozer Health resulted in 2,651 people being laid off. The collapse of Rite Aid led to more than 1,000 corporate employees being laid off. The number of Rite Aid employees laid off was much higher, considering the company closed more than 300 stores in the state in 2025. Workplaces with fewer than 50 employees aren’t required to notify the state. The federal WARN Act offers protection to workers, their families, and communities by requiring employers to provide a 60-day notice of mass layoffs or business closings involving a large number of layoffs. Enforcement of the WARN Act falls under the U.S. Department of Labor. Typically, an employer must submit a notice to the state if it will shut down a plant and the shutdown will result in a job loss for 50 or more employees during any 30-day period. Employers also must give notice if they plan to lay off 500 or more employees in a 30-day period or if they will be laying off at least 50 people and those people represent at least 33 percent of their active workforce. Please note that some of the layoffs listed below have not happened yet, but the WARN notices were filed earlier this year. While most WARN notices are permanent, there are times when they are temporary and times when the affected employees are hired immediately by another company taking over a contract. All of the employers below announced layoffs of at least 250 people in Pennsylvania in 2025: SPS Technologies - 251 Located at: 301 Highland Ave., Abington Township, Montgomery County, near Jenkintown The manufacturing company, which produces fasteners and other materials for the aviation industry, laid off 251 people after a fire broke out at its plant earlier this year. “This layoff is a result of the unforeseeable business circumstances and economic downturn caused by the fire at our facility on February 17, 2025,” the company said in the WARN notice. Fourth Street Barbecue - 252 Located at: 3 Arentzen Blvd., Speers, Washington County, near Charleroi The company laid off 252 people. Spark Therapeutics - 298 Located at: The biotechnology research company laid off 298 employees at the three locations in Philadelphia. In addition, some remote employees were laid off as well. Instant Web - 298 Located at: 100 Industrial Drive, Tilden Township, Berks County, near Hamburg Instant Web, doing business as IWCO laid off 298 people due to a closing. The company is based in Minnesota and provides advertising services. Corelle Brands - 323 Located at: 12000 Molly Pitcher Highway, Antrim Township, near Greencastle, Franklin County Glassware and dishware company Corelle Brands, formerly known as Instant Brands, laid off 323 people due to a closing. Corelle’s brands include Instant, Corelle, Pyrex, Corningware, Snapware and Chicago Cutlery. Wilson Creek Energy - 332 Located at: Wilson Creek Energy/Corsa Coal filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January and laid off 332 people at the 11 locations in March. The company produces metallurgical coal. Comprehensive Logistics - 365 Located at: 609 Memory Lane, Springettsbury Township, York County The company laid off 365 people in September at the location. IG Design Group Americas - 383 Located at: IG Design Group Americas closed three facilities and laid off 383 people on Aug. 26. Design Group Americas designs, manufactures, sources and distributes a variety of products in the seasonal, stationery, gift, craft and toy categories. The Berwick-area plant manufactured bows and ribbons as well as materials used in the floral industry. The company said at the time that it was selling its business segments while winding down its manufactured woven ribbon products business. “Like many companies in the consumer products sector, DGA has been navigating a challenging operating landscape for several years, compounded by the loss of a major customer, who entered liquidation and significantly impacted DGA’s revenue as well as new trade tariffs imposed in 2025 that increased operational costs, affected pricing strategies, and contributed to reduced customer orders,” the company said in a news release. “The Company’s decision to pursue an in-court process was driven by liquidity constraints, substantial working capital requirements, and the seasonal nature of significant portions of its business.” The “major customer” that entered into liquidation was JoAnn, according to the retail industry publication, RetailDive. Amazon - 432 Located at: 17 William Drive, Findlay Township, Allegheny County, near Imperial Amazon laid off 432 people — 273 regular associates and 159 seasonal associates whose temporary assignments were ending — due to a planned renovation project at the facility. The layoffs took place on March 12. The company said employees who accepted internal transfer opportunities at Amazon prior to March 12 would not be laid off. Oak View Group - 522 Located at: 150 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia The company’s contract at Citizens Bank Park for the Philadelphia Phillies will end on Dec. 31, 2025. The company provides housekeeping and general maintenance operations for the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park. The company told state officials its contract wasn’t renewed. The Oak View Group told the state it has 522 employees, of which 500 are part-time and are under a collective bargaining agreement. Oak View Group services multiple venues in the Philadelphia area and officials said it welcomed employees to apply for other positions in the region. Cleveland-Cliffs - 664 Located at: The company closed both steel plants. Cleveland-Cliffs laid off 68 salaried employees and 491 bargaining unit workers at the Steelton plant. The 151-year-old Steelton plant produced rails that carry freight and passengers, along with steel for heavy machinery, power generation plants and military applications such as submarines. “Weak demand and insufficient pricing for the products produced at our Steelton steelmaking facility has led Cleveland-Cliffs to conclude that this facility is not economically viable in the current market conditions,” the company said in a WARN notice. The company laid off 10 salaried employees and 97 bargaining unit workers at its plate finishing plant in Montgomery County. United Natural Foods Located at: 4255 E. Independence Drive in North Whitehall Township, Lehigh County, near Schnecksville Food wholesaler United Natural Foods closed the distribution center and laid off 717 people. Among the employees were 172 truck drivers. The distribution center closure is due to UNFI ending its agreement to provide services for Key Food. Rhode Island-based UNFI provided the following statement at the time to PennLive: “Recently, UNFI and Key Food mutually agreed to transition Key Food’s conventional grocery products business in the Northeast to another wholesaler. We believe this transition will be a better fit for Key Food and allows UNFI to exit an unprofitable relationship. At UNFI, we are continuously evaluating our distribution network to ensure we are serving our customers and suppliers as efficiently and effectively as possible. As part of these efforts, we will be ending operations at our Allentown distribution center in July 2025 and will transition these customers and suppliers to nearby distribution centers in our network. Moving Allentown’s volume to nearby DCs will enable us to serve our local partners in an efficient and sustainable way going forward." Crothall and Morrison Healthcare Located at: 3400 Spruce St., Philadelphia (Penn Medicine) Crothall and Morrison Healthcare is laying off 795 people. The layoffs were announced in 2025 but won’t take place until Feb. 1, 2026. Rite Aid Located at: The drugstore chain filed for bankruptcy a second time in May and went out of business in September. The company laid off 501 people who worked at or reported to the Valley Green Office Facility at 200 Newberry Commons. The drugstore chain also laid off 595 people who reported to the company’s headquarters at 1200 Intrepid Ave. Rite Aid said the following in the WARN notices: “Rite Aid only recently received notice from a significant vendor shortening and restricting payment terms, which could cause Rite Aid’s loan to our lenders to be accelerated,” the company said in the WARN notice. “Rite Aid’s lenders have informed us that they will not provide future funding for Rite Aid to cover payroll and employment related expenses if we retain the entirety of our current workforce.” “As a result, we have no choice but to conduct employee separations at this time to enable us to continue to meet anticipated future payroll and employment related expenses.” “In addition, the dramatic downturn in the economy, potential litigation, and increased costs (including tariffs) from our suppliers and landlords have necessitated employee separations that were unforeseen, as we were actively seeking funding and pursuing several alternative strategic transactions with the hope that this action could be avoided or postponed.” Crozer Health In what was one of the largest layoffs in recent years in the Keystone State, the hospital system closed multiple locations in Pennsylvania and 2,621 people were laid off. At least one county, two cities and a township issued emergency declarations following the hospital closing. Prospect Medical Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. Initially, a buyer agreed to purchase the operations, but later backed out of the deal. Prospect then reached an agreement with the state to appoint a receiver to take over the strategic decision-making and finances of Prospect for the Pennsylvania facilities from Feb. 5 to March 5. The agreement was later extended to April 18. On April 9, Prospect said it received an offer from the University of Pennsylvania Health System, which intended to provide $5 million in funding, the majority of which would be a donation to Prospect, to allow for a further extension of time to reach an agreement on a purchase of the Pennsylvania facilities. On April 17, Prospect said it was informed that the donation would no longer be available to allow for the extension. With no buyer and no additional funding, Prospect said it was forced to close operations and permanently lay off all employees at its facilities in Chester and Delaware counties. The closings took place in April. At the time, Chester Mayor Stefan Roots had signed an emergency declaration for the city in response to the Prospect’s closing announcement. “City Council and I are devastated by this crisis, and we are taking every possible step to address the negative impact this closure will have on the City of Chester and its residents,” Roots said. “We are actively working with the receiver and his team to identify viable solutions that will ensure our residents continue to have access to prompt emergency medical services, which will be impacted by Prospect’s irresponsible actions.” Daniel Urie is an award-winning business reporter for the PA Media Group/PennLive/The Patriot-News.

Title: Vitalik Buterin maps Ethereum’s 2026 rebellion against centralised ‘overlords’

About us Copy link Ethereum is charging into 2026 with a manifesto — not a roadmap. That message comes directly from co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who said that Ethereum is the “rebellion” against “centralised overlords.” “We’re building decentralised applications,” Buterin said on X. “Applications that run without fraud, censorship or third-party interference.” The $365 billion blockchain network aims to be “civilisational infrastructure” that can resist censorship, service intermediaries, and corporate dominance, he said. “These properties sound radical,” he wrote, “but we must remember that a generation ago any wallet, kitchen appliance, book or car would fulfill every single one of them.” Buterin’s note comes as power and wealth in the technology industry become increasingly concentrated in the hands of just a few top corporate players from Silicon Valley, who are all highly centralised. The Mag 7 US tech companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla, are now worth more than the combined stock markets of Japan, Canada, and the UK. “Ethereum is the rebellion against this,” Buterin said. “Fortunately, we have powerful tools on our side,” he wrote. “But we need to apply them, and we will.” Buterin may be championing Ethereum’s decentralised nature, but many of the banks, traditional financial firms and fintechs exploring launching stablecoins are doing so on the Ethereum blockchain — letting centralised companies use the digital ledger. Ethereum is kicking off the new year trading nearly 40% below its August all-time high of $4,950. Investors in recent months have been relentlessly dumping exchange-traded funds backed by the second-largest crypto. DefiLlama data shows $616 million in Ethereum ETF selling in December, adding to November’s $1.4 billion in liquidations. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 stock index is still hovering near all-time highs. Other assets, such as gold, are also pushing to record highs amid strong macroeconomic tailwinds. To be sure, Ethereum has plenty of bullish institutional supporters. Tom Lee, chairman of digital asset treasury firm Bitmine, said on X that he expects Ethereum to have a good 2026. “Gold moves lead crypto,” Lee said. “If these large commodity markets make such a move, how can one be skeptical of digital assets in 2026?” Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

Title: Russia’s little-known $13bn crypto secret set for 2026 takeoff

About us Copy link Russians are warming to crypto, encouraged by the country’s banks and regulators. And they’re using cutting-edge solutions to build an investment ecosystem that can sidestep Western sanctions, past, present, or future. For Moscow, the future of finance is digital — and it lives on a blockchain. But while they’ve turned to traditional digital assets like Bitcoin, analysts expect a Russian take on tokenised securities and commodities, industrial Bitcoin mining, and crypto derivatives to take off in 2026. Digital financial assets, Russia‘s take on the buzzy tokenisation trend also called DFAs, have grown by over a third to become a $13 billion market in 2025, the Russian central bank estimates. But unlike many of the tokenised commodities traded in the West, they’re built on private blockchains and can only be traded on domestic platforms that hold central bank-issued permits. They now sit at the centre of Russia’s blockchain-powered economic expansion plans. DFA issuers have released tokens tied to the value of everything from cocoa beans to St. Petersburg real estate. The total volume of Russian DFA placements in the first nine months of 2025 increased by 33%, Vitaly Plotnikov, the deputy director of the central bank’s financial market infrastructure department, told Russian news agency Interfax in early December. Yields on short-term DFAs this year exceeded short-term bond yields by an average of 1.7%, he added. And it’s set to grow. In early December, Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the State Duma’s commission on the financial markets and the chief architect of Russia’s crypto legislation, said boosting the DFA market will be a key economic priority for Moscow in 2026. Aksakov added that the government aims to achieve tax parity for DFA investors in 2026, placing them on the same tax footing as traditional bondholders. “This will allow the DFA market to grow significantly, attract money for longer periods, and accumulate resources for business and economic development,” Aksakov said. Moscow has granted operating licences to 16 more Russian firms since Atomyze issued its first DFA, according to Russian central bank data. While most of these license-holders are banks, in August, the bank also granted a DFA-issuing license to a startup named Madrigal, which offers DFA issuance-as-a-service products. The Moscow Exchange, or MOEX, and Russian banks are also championing so-called crypto derivatives. As Russians cannot buy shares in popular US-based Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, MOEX and major banks have launched their own funds. ’The central bank has expressed a readiness to introduce new cryptocurrency regulations.‘ Those funds track the prices of popular BlackRock offerings, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. The popularity of these products has ballooned since they launched in the summer. After breaking MOEX trading volume records in September, crypto futures trading volumes on MOEX reached $636 million, a new record for futures contracts, the Russian publication Tsargrad reported. Crypto derivatives look set to grow rapidly in 2026. MOEX, the St. Petersburg Exchange and major banks — such as T-Bank, Alfa-Bank, and Sberbank — have all either launched their own crypto derivatives this year, or plan to do so in early 2026. While the central bank has previously tried to ensure only super-rich, “super-qualified” investors can buy crypto-related products, the government wants to make them more accessible. And the central bank is accommodating. “The central bank has expressed a readiness to introduce new cryptocurrency regulations,” Aksakov said. Major lenders are ready to take a step further and are waiting for permission to let their customers trade Bitcoin directly from their banking apps. Bitcoin mining is another core crypto sector set to grow in Russia in 2026. Dmitry Stupin, Vice President of the Russian Association of Cryptoindustry and Blockchain for Electricity Generation, told the Russian news agency TASS in November that mining volumes in Russia would recover to their 2024 peak of 2.1 to 2.2 GW in 2026 after dropping to around 1.7 GW in 2025. Stupin said that as industrial miners start using their own gas-fired power generation and upgrade their rigs, miners are set to return to their 2024 highs. The prediction does not seem far-fetched. After all, electricity is relatively cheap in energy-abundant Russia, and the cooling costs required to prevent mining rigs from overheating are minimal in famously cold regions like Siberia. Industrial mining was born in Southern Siberia in 2017, with the launch of the mining firm BitRiver. Since then, scores of competitors have emerged. In August 2024, President Vladimir Putin signed a law legalising industrial crypto mining. This paved the way for institutional and private investors to enter industrial crypto mining. In August, mining chiefs told the Russian media outlet RBC that it was only “a matter of time” before a major Russian mining company would seek a listing on MOEX.

Title: Solana enters 2026 with last-minute boost in RWA momentum

Solana finished the year with record tokenized RWA activity and strong inflows into Solana ETFs, which could push SOL toward new highs in 2026. Cointelegraph in your social feed Solana appears poised to expand from its memecoin-focused, retail-dominant network this year, after posting record real-world asset tokenization activity in December. Data from RWA.xyz shows the value of tokenized RWAs on Solana increased nearly 10% over the last month to a record-high $873.3 million, while the number of Solana RWA token holders rose over 18.4% to 126,236 over the same timeframe. The majority of these RWAs back US Treasuries, such as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund and the Ondo US Dollar Yield, which boast market caps of $255.4 million and $175.8 million, respectively. New tokenized stocks like Tesla xStock and Nvidia xStock are also rising, at $48.3 million and $17.6 million, respectively, while institutional funds are also being tokenized on Solana. Solana is poised to become the third blockchain to exceed $1 billion in tokenized RWAs, behind Ethereum at $12.3 billion and BNB Chain, which recently passed $2 billion. Last month, crypto asset manager Bitwise predicted Solana would set a new all-time high should the US pass the market-structure-focused CLARITY Act in 2026. Related: Can Solana shed its memecoin image in 2026? If it passes, Bitwise expects crypto tokenization will take off, with Solana being one of the biggest winners from that upward trend: “We’re bullish on Ethereum and Solana. Really bullish. Primarily because we think stablecoins and tokenization are megatrends, and Ethereum and Solana are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of that growth.” Solana (SOL) enters 2026 at a significantly lower price than it began 2025, trading around $125 versus roughly $190 this time last year. SOL is also over 57% off the $293.3 all-time high it set on Jan. 19, 2025, while Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) set their all-time highs more recently — October and August — and are currently trading much closer to those prices. Solana's legitimacy in the institutional space strengthened in late October when the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first lot of now six spot Solana exchange-traded funds. Those Solana products have combined for $765 million in inflows, Farside Investors data shows. Also in October, international remittance giant Western Union chose Solana to build its stablecoin settlements platform on for its more than 150 million customers, spread across over 200 countries and territories. It is expected to roll out in the first half of 2026. Solana is leading all blockchains in app revenue, proving it can generate high income even when memecoin activity slows. Over the past 30 days, it raked in over $110 million, far ahead of second-place Hyperliquid at $61.1 million and nearly double Ethereum’s $47.2 million, DeFiLlama data shows.

Full Content:
The year 2025 was a bloodbath for film, streaming, television, and news workers in Hollywood as the media continued its downward spiral from its once commanding position as a leading American institution. The Wrap reports that television and film lost upwards to 17,000 jobs in 2025, a loss 18 percent higher than last year. News divisions, for instance, cut about 2,254 jobs across television, film, broadcast, news and streaming services through November of 2025. The loss, though, fell below the 4,537 job losses in 2024. “The most cited reason for layoffs was restructuring and industry consolidation,” the Wrap added. The FCC approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media and as the year came to a close Warner Bros. Discovery also began its move to merge with whatever outfit will end up buying it in the coming year. But job loss was a constant across it all. Even Disney continued its trend of mass layoffs despite still holding out on its own. The layoffs will continue, too, and Artificial Intelligence might be to blame for much of it. According to the World Economic Forum, 41 percent of companies worldwide will lay off workers over the next five years because they intend to begin increasing reliance on AI technology. One example is the workforce depletion at Amazon, which castoff 14,000 employees in October. This AI issue has already cost tens of thousands of current and future jobs in Hollywood, analysts say. A report from June noted that as many as 200,000 Hollywood jobs will either be lost or won’t ever be created thanks to AI. Still, some new jobs will undoubtedly be created because of AI as some workers will be needed to control the tech. Regardless, The Wrap added that 71,000 layoffs occurred in 2025 thanks to AI. At year’s end, the biggest loser appears to be Paramount, which shed 2,000 employees. Comcast’s Versant cable shed 150, which was seven percent of its workforce, and Disney laid off less than 800 across its various holdings and divisions worldwide, The Wrap continued. After years of heavier layoffs, Warner Bros. only shed about 100 across its cable holdings. But that will certainly tick upward once WBD is bought out next year. In fact, some analysts expect WBD to lose upwards to 6,000 employees after its buyout. The film industry in Los Angeles continued to contract in 2025. Hollywood had lost 100,000 jobs by the end of 2024 — or a 30 percent decline — as film and TV productions moved to other U.S. states, Canada, Mexico, or places overseas. And by April of this year, Hollywood ranked in only 6th place for the number of film and TV productions operating there. And Deadline reported in October that the downward trend in film and TV production continued through the third quarter of this year. Meanwhile, media otherwise also continued contracting as news and print media either laid off workers, canceled expansion plans, or shut down completely. Publishers Dotdash Meredith dumped 143 employees, and then after the rebranded to People Inc., shed another 226. The Washington Post eliminated four percent of its workforce, or 100 workers, CNN dumped 200 staffers, PBS laid off 15 percent of its workforce, CBS News cancelled the streaming companions to CBS Mornings and CBS News and eliminated those employees, and Business Insider dumped 21 percent of its staff. Layoffs were also felt at Variety, Rolling Stone, and Billboard. The media will continue facing tough times next year and there seems to be no end yet in sight to a leveling.

Title: Bitcoin options boom raises fears of capped BTC upside
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-options-under-fire-as-covered-calls-take-center-stage
Time Published: 2026-01-01T20:00:00Z

Bitcoin cash-and-carry trades faded toward the end of the year, leading funds to shift to Bitcoin options for yield. Is the strategy putting a cap on BTC price? Cointelegraph in your social feed Key takeaways: Covered calls gained traction as cash-and-carry returns collapsed, but data shows they are not structurally suppressing Bitcoin’s price. Stable put-to-call ratios and rising put demand suggest hedging and yield strategies coexist with bullish positioning. As Bitcoin (BTC) price entered a downtrend in November, traders began forming theories about why institutional inflows and corporate accumulation failed to sustain price levels above $110,000. One explanation frequently cited is the rising demand for Bitcoin options, particularly those linked to the BlackRock iShares spot Bitcoin (IBIT) exchange-traded fund. The aggregate Bitcoin options open interest climbed to $49 billion in December 2025 from $39 billion in December 2024, putting the covered call strategy under closer scrutiny. Critics argue that by “renting out” their upside for a fee, large investors have unintentionally created a ceiling that prevents Bitcoin from entering its next parabolic phase. To understand this argument, it helps to view a covered call as a trade-off between price appreciation and steady income. In a covered call strategy, an investor who already owns Bitcoin sells a call (buy) option to another party. This gives the buyer the right to purchase that Bitcoin at a fixed price, such as $100,000 by a specified date. In return, the seller receives an upfront cash payment, similar to earning interest on a bond. This options strategy differs from fixed income products because the seller continues to hold a volatile asset, even though their potential upside is capped. If Bitcoin rallies to $120,000, the seller must sell at $100,000, effectively missing the additional gains. Traders argue that this dynamic suppresses price action because professional dealers who purchase these options often sell Bitcoin in the spot market to hedge their exposure, creating a persistent “sell wall” around popular strike prices. This shift toward options-based yield is a direct response to the collapse of the cash and carry trade, which involves selling BTC futures while holding an equivalent position in the spot market. For much of late 2024, traders captured a steady 10% to 15% premium. By February 2025, however, that premium had fallen below 10%, and by November it struggled to remain above 5%. In search of higher returns, funds rotated into covered calls, which offered more attractive annualized yields of 12% to 18%. This transition is evident in IBIT options, where open interest jumped to $40 billion from $12 billion in late 2024. Even so, the put-to-call ratio has stayed stable below 60%. If widespread “suppressive” call selling were truly the dominant force, this ratio would likely have collapsed as the market became saturated with call sellers. Instead, the balance implies that for every yield-focused seller, there is still a buyer positioning for a breakout. The put-to-call ratio suggests that while some participants are selling upside call options, a much larger group is purchasing put (sell) instruments as protection against a potential price decline. The recent defensive stance is reflected in the skew metric. While IBIT put options traded at a 2% discount in late 2024, they now trade at a 5% premium. At the same time, implied volatility, the market’s measure of expected turbulence, declined to 45% or lower from May onward, down from 57% in late 2024. Lower volatility reduces the premiums earned by sellers, meaning the incentive to deploy this so-called “suppressive” strategy has actually weakened, even as total open interest has increased. Arguing that covered calls are holding prices down makes little sense when the sellers of those call options stand to benefit most if prices rise toward their target levels. Rather than acting as a constraint, the options market has become the primary venue where Bitcoin’s volatility is being monetized for yield.

2025 in phones, computing, TVs, gaming, cameras, streaming and more When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. So farewell, 2025 – you were frequently exciting, regularly chaotic, occasionally frustrating but always interesting. And that’s how we like it around here. It was a year in which often fairly iterative improvements to hardware were overshadowed by rapid and significant advances on the computing side of things. I’m talking, of course, about AI, which is now so dominant within the tech world that it’s increasingly hard to find a device that doesn’t have an AI brain. Not that I’m complaining, because the leaps made in 2025 by the likes of OpenAI’s Sora and Google’s Gemini were truly astonishing; the pace of change is such that it feels like we’re squeezing about a decade’s worth of advances into each year now, and I wouldn’t like to predict what the state of play will be in 12 months’ time. Well, other than to say that we’ll be taking for granted things which seem almost impossible right now – although as our AI Editor Graham Barlow notes below, maybe we’re already doing that. In comparison, it often looked in 2025 as though things were slowing down on the hardware side. Could Apple really make its already-excellent MacBooks much better? Could Samsung improve much on the superb Galaxy S series? Was there much scope for OLED TVs or wireless headphones or mirrorless cameras to develop? The answer was yes, yes and yes. Though the upgrades to many models may not have been as big as those on the software side, they were frequently excellent in their own right. The improvements to battery life, screen tech and camera lenses may not be as flashy as those on the AI front, but they can make a real difference to how we use our devices on a daily basis. In many ways, tech fans have never had it so good. Whether that will continue in 2026 remains to be seen. AI now looks to be having a direct – and negative – effect on component prices, which could make your favorite new phone or laptop more expensive in the coming year. We might also see stock shortages in some areas, which could further inflate those price tags. It looks like we’re set for another year of exciting, chaotic, frustrating and interesting news, then – and we’ll be here with you every step of the way. Until then, I hope you’ve enjoyed reading TechRadar in 2025, and have a happy New Year! Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This year was marked by astonishing leaps in AI capabilities, which I tried to not only report on but experience in full. From my first experience with ‘vibe coding’ to wild leaps of fancy with Veo 3 (and later the Sora app) to creating my own digital double, AI’s fast-changing capabilities constantly amazed me. Never in four decades of covering emerging technologies have I seen anything like it: AI’s rise continues to be a heady mixture of enthusiastic adoption tinged with white-knuckled fear about what it all means for jobs, and for humanity, and nothing we saw in 2025 did much to resolve that anxiety. However, it was my conversations with those leading the AI and wider innovation charge that stood out. My interviews with Amazon’s Panos Panay about Alexa+ and Google’s Sameer Samat about the future of Android were particularly memorable, as was the moment when one of Apple’s top executives threw his brand-new iPhone Air to me during a video podcast and insisted that I try to bend it. The rise of humanoid robots was a trend that shocked and pleased me in equal measure, though I’ve tried to temper my enthusiasm with the knowledge that clever marketing and eye-popping videos will only get us so far. We all want the ultimate home robot, but I still don't think many of us are willing to pay $20,000 to get it. Away from all the AI and robots, I spent much of the year trying new phones, including redesigned iPhones and an incredibly thin folding Samsung phone, along with a wide range of wearable technology that included the Galaxy XR headset, and some very exciting AR glasses from Meta and Google’s Android XR group. Experiencing these felt like peering into our near technological future, which increasingly will be filled with on-demand AI, flexible phones, and maybe those robots. For all the talk of breakthroughs and hype, 2025 felt less like the year AI changed everything and more like the year it quietly became unavoidable. While the much-hyped arrival of super-powerful artificial general intelligence (AGI), predicted for 2025 by many, simply hasn’t materialized, the year has still been a strong one for companies such as OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and Google. That said, there have also been some massive flops; and as for Apple, it feels like yet another year in which it slipped further behind in the AI race. ChatGPT maintained its vice-like grip as the most popular AI chatbot in the world, though it hasn’t been plain sailing for OpenAI. Legal challenges, particularly the copyright infringement claim brought by The New York Times, have continued to dog the company, and in June its servers crashed for a couple of days, giving the world a brief taste of life without the ubiquitous chatbot. OpenAI then fumbled the ball with the release of its GPT-5 model, which came across as cold and unemotional compared to the previous GPT-4o. For millions of users who’d come to rely on the chatbot as something closer to a trusted companion it felt like a best friend had undergone a personality transplant overnight, forcing OpenAI to make the legacy 4o model available again. The company has also lost a little ground to Google’s Gemini in recent months. The arrival of Gemini 3 Pro in November was well received, and on the image front, Gemini’s Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro proved superior to ChatGPT for image generation. OpenAI responded with a new image-generation model in December. AI-powered pets and toys also began to appear this year. We took Moflin for a spin, until we accidentally fried its battery. More broadly, the dominant theme of the year was that every product must now have AI built into it in some form, and no company exemplifies this approach better than Microsoft, which has spent the year enthusiastically stuffing Copilot into just about everything it makes. Finally, the year looks set to end on a high note for Amazon. Alexa+, the AI-powered version of Alexa that Amazon has been promising all year but hasn’t yet managed to fully roll out, may finally be getting a web version, at least in the US. 2025 was the year of the super-thin phone, writes Roland Moore-Colyer, Managing Editor, Mobile Computing, with the release of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in the first half of the year, and the iPhone Air in the second. These handsets grabbed headlines with their svelte proportions, but so far sales figures have yet to match the hype. That’s likely due to their relatively high prices in the face of already pretty slim iPhones and Galaxy and Pixel handsets, all of which saw the expected yearly upgrades with the iPhone 17, Galaxy S25 and Pixel 10 lines respectively. While the upgrades to the iPhone 17 family appeared incremental at first glance, I'd argue they're a bigger deal when you dig into the details: there was a new design and cooling system for the Pro phones, the standard model finally got a 120Hz display, and Apple's 48MP 'Fusion' camera came to every iPhone in the lineup, including the Air (the Plus model went the way of the dodo). AI found its way into more phones and more features, with Google’s Pixel phones in particular boasting a whole host of genuinely useful smart tools. Meanwhile, Apple just about managed to distract us from the shortcomings of Apple Intelligence with its flashy Liquid Glass design and the eye-catching Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro. Some of the most interesting phones came from smaller brands, with the Nothing Phone 3 offering something a little different without scrimping on flagship features. There was the Oppo Find X9 Pro with its strange but useful camera kit, while the OnePlus 15 was the only phone to earn a maximum five-star review from us this year. There were also a clutch of affordable phones from the likes of Motorola and Xiaomi, proving that you don’t have to pay a lot to get a very capable smartphone these days. We saw further evolution in the folding phone space, with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 leading the way, and Samsung also unveiled its first tri-folding phone, with the Galaxy Trifold joining Huawei's Mate XT, and teasing a future of devices that truly blend phones and tablets. We may even see a foldable iPhone in 2026, but don’t hold your breath. When it came to computing, 2025 didn't start off as the most promising year. While 2024 felt like a year of revolutionary change, with the explosive growth of AI, the fall of Intel, and the rise of Arm-based laptops that were actually worth buying, this year has felt more like we're in a holding pattern, as the innovations of the past few years are iterated on and refined.The year kicked off with Nvidia launching its latest generation of consumer graphics cards, the RTX 5000 series, at CES 2025, and they encapsulated the ‘evolution, not revolution’ theme, with some great new features that haven't fundamentally shaken up the industry, as the introduction of ray tracing with the RTX 2000 series did. Of course, making a great product even better is no bad thing, and our components editor and GPU expert John Loeffler was suitably impressed, enthusing in his RTX 5090 review that “If you're a gamer, you'll still get impressive gen-on-gen performance improvements over the celebrated RTX 4090, and the Nvidia RTX 5090 is really the first consumer graphics card I've tested that can get you consistent, high-frame-rate 8K gameplay.”I have an RTX 5090 and I love it, and I've also been impressed by its 8K performance in modern games, but with the majority of PC gamers still playing at 1080p, this high-end GPU might be a bit too expensive to justify. Other releases from AMD and Intel, plus Apple’s latest M5 chip, continued the theme of impressive releases that don’t massively change the computing landscape.Perhaps the biggest event in 2025 was the continued rise of AI. Recently, the AI boom has led to a global shortage of memory, which has in turn caused an increase in the prices of devices that use it. All of a sudden, PCs, RAM, and GPUs look set to get increasingly expensive, though some, like our computing editor Christian Guyton, aren’t too worried – yet. Personally, the end-of-year drama is making me nostalgic for those early months when 2025 felt rather boring. This year saw two really interesting developments in TV technology, with the first being the arrival of a whole new kind of ‘Tandem RGB’ OLED TV panel from LG. This appeared in the LG G5, helping it to score the maximum five stars in our review, and in the fantastic Panasonic Z95B, enabling both TVs to hit stunning levels of brightness and color depth, but with reduced power consumption. However, this new screen technology didn’t win either of those sets our TV of the Year award – that went to the Samsung S95F, which not only earned its own perfect 5-star review, but was also voted the top TV in the most categories by the judges in our flagship OLED TV showdown, which pitted it against the LG G5, Panasonic Z95B, and Sony Bravia 8 II. The second big tech development was the arrival of RGB mini-LED tech – and, make no mistake, this is the next big thing. It’s more efficient than current mini-LED tech, and is capable of richer colors and less light leakage from bright areas to dark ones, and it could be the tech to finally knock OLED off its perch. We know that Samsung, LG, TCL and Hisense will all launch RGB mini-LED TV ranges in 2026, but the Hisense UX116 was the only TV to use it in 2025 – and it was a mixed bag, with performance issues that disappointed given its eye-wateringly high price. Still, we’re excited to see how this tech develops. But the biggest thing in TVs this year was the TVs themselves – as in, they got big and they got affordable. TCL and Hisense launched 85-inch and 100-inch TVs that were within the budgets of regular mortals, and 75-inch TVs are becoming positively cheap, while still being good. While new tech is exciting, huge TVs like the Hisense U8N and TCL QM7K becoming more affordable is the change that made the biggest difference for customers. This year XR or 'extended reality' took center stage, thanks in large part to Android XR hardware finally breaking cover in the shape of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset. We also tested prototype Android XR glasses ahead of their expected release in the coming year, and they’re impressive (the glasses at least, the headset less so right now). Google, along with its Android partners, looks set to seriously challenge Meta in 2026. For its part Meta debuted several new smart wearables over the past 12 months, including two pairs of Oakley smart glasses – the stylish HSTNs and the sporty Vanguards, the latter of which are perfect for runners when used with a compatible Garmin watch. We also saw a Gen 2 model of the Meta Ray-Bans, and the company's latest step towards full-on AR specs, the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which as you can probably guess feature a display for the specs to relay info visually. We’ve tested them, and they’re everything Google Glass wanted to be, but right now they're not easy to get hold of. What about VR headsets proper? Valve surprised no one (because the device was so heavily leaked before launch) with its Steam Frame headset announcement. Key details like the price are still a mystery, but it will be landing in 2026 – and when it does, the spec sheet teases a device that could seriously challenge the reigning champion of VR, the Meta Quest 3. Depending on how Valve handles the launch, I wouldn’t be surprised if it makes all other headsets feel obsolete – even the Galaxy XR and Apple Vision Pro. Talking of Apple's mixed-reality spatial-computing headset, we got a new version with an M5 chip and comfier strap, but while it's a worthwhile upgrade the price still feels too high. If 2024 was the year niche UK hi-fi brands took over the dance floor amid a hiatus from audio's heavy hitters (see Bowers & Wilkins' fantastic Pi8 earbuds or Cambridge Audio's inaugural, affordable, adorable P100 cans), 2025 was the year the big dogs returned to the party and got their groove back. We got five major headphones releases in 2025, starting with the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds in February. The hotly anticipated update to the 2019 Powerbeats Pro proved that Apple could indeed deliver heart-rate monitoring in its earbuds. Cut to May and Sony's WH-1000XM6 landed, to finally knock the 2020-issue WH-1000XM4 off the top spot in our best headphones guide. It was a similar story with the June arrival of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen), quickly followed by the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) in September – a two-pronged attack on the market that saw Bose reinstated as the king of ANC. However, this roundup wouldn't be complete without a nod to the biggest launch of them all: the fall arrival of Apple's AirPods Pro 3. The shape's different, the ANC is twice as good, and yes, like the Powerbeats Pro 2 they also keep tabs on your ticker, in a slightly different way, and with increasing third-party fitness-app support. Still the most popular earbuds in the world? Absolutely. Elsewhere, Spotify Lossless finally landed, at no cost to Premium subscribers, offering almost-as-good-as-Apple-Music resolution at up to 24-bit/44.1kHz. While Lossless wasn't a huge hit with fans initially, the big green streaming machine's popularity continues to grow, despite concerns over artist payments. Oh, and if you take note of just one audio brand name this year, let it be WiiM. As Sonos continues to tackle trust issues among its once-loyal fanbase, the plucky multi-room underdog unveiled its WiiM Sound (and now the WiiM Sound Lite) premium hi-res speakers – and the firm would love to help you build your wireless sound system around them. 2025 was full of pleasant surprises for photographers. The Sigma BF was truly out of the ordinary, being dubbed ‘the camera Apple would have made’, while the Caira with its Nano Banana AI skills showed us a glimpse of how on-the-go generative editing can work in an actual camera. Fujifilm and OM System showed us that user experience matters with the quirky X half and retro OM-3 respectively, while Hasselblad and Nikon delivered strong offerings of their own – my favorite stills camera ever, the X2D II, and a new player in the cinema-camera game, the Nikon Zr. A special shoutout goes to Nikon for becoming the best-value camera brand this year, notably for the excellent Z5 II, which is our Camera of the Year, and Z50 II. It was arguably an even better year for new lenses than cameras, with Sigma, Sony and Viltrox in particular knocking it out the park with world-first and affordable optics. Canon continues to lock out third parties from its full-frame camera lineup, but that decision feels more justified after it launched the affordable and capable 45mm F1.2 STM prime. A sense of order was restored towards the end of the year when Canon and Sony launched their anticipated mid-range full-frame cameras: the EOS R6 III and A7 V, both of which are integral to their lineups. The long-threatened US ban on DJI products finally came into effect, and we saw a couple of major product launches from the brand in the build-up to it: the incredible (sort of) sub-250g Mini 5 Pro, and the DJI Osmo 360 – its first foray into 360 cameras, and rival to both the Insta 360 X5 and GoPro’s new Max 2. DJI is also being tipped to launch its first 360 drone soon, but Insta360 got there first with the truly innovative Antigravity A1. Overall, it’s been a good year for camera fans, with demand seemingly remaining strong in the face of competition from increasingly capable smartphones. I’m predicting that the consumer and cinema camera spaces will continue converging in 2026, and I hope the likes of Viltrox expand our options with new and affordable autofocus zoom lenses. Gaming in 2025 was largely dominated by the arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s a safe improvement on the original Switch, and one that epitomizes the ‘evolution not revolution’ approach to console development. The specs sheet won’t blow anyone’s socks off, but it’s a superb package that cements the Switch's position as the go-to handheld console; and it was so popular in the pre-order and launch phases that it took months for retailers to catch up with demand. It’s been backed up by some excellent games too, including Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Kirby Air Riders, and Pokémon Legends Z-A. Sony had its own say in the gaming handheld space, breathing new life into the PlayStation Portal handheld device, which is now capable of excellent cloud streaming. This has elevated the handheld, which we were already big fans of, to impressive new heights. The PS5’s game library got a bump with Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Ghost of Yotei, as well as titles including Borderlands 4, Battlefield 6, Arc Raiders and TechRadar Gaming’s Game of the Year, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Elsewhere, indie games ruled, with the likes of Blue Prince, Hades 2, and Hollow Knight: Silksong proving standouts in a strong year for releases. It’s been a year to forget for Xbox, however, and its woes only accentuated the aforementioned successes for Nintendo and Sony. For starters, more Xbox games – including Gears of War: Reloaded – arrived on PS5, while others are set to follow, including the symbol of Xbox itself, Halo. Meanwhile studios were shuttered and prospective games cancelled, and to make matters worse the Xbox X/S were outsold by a tiny family console, the Nex Playground, over Black Friday. All in all it’s been tough going for Team Green. As for 2026, it’s beginning to feel like the pace of progress towards next-gen consoles will quicken, and the game release calendar looks well stocked. However, a titan looms: Grand Theft Auto 6 is now slated for release in November after being originally planned for late 2025, and the whole gaming world is going to revolve around its arrival. Last year, I ended my contribution to this round-up by predicting a move away from fitness watches towards screenless trackers, such as a new WHOOP model, writes Matt Evans, Senior Editor, Fitness, Wellness & Wearables. Well, we got not one, but two new WHOOPs, and they were… fine. But, as prices rose, I found the ongoing subscription model far too expensive. However, my prediction that we’d move away from smartwatches hasn’t really been borne out. Wearable tech isn’t changing much in the mainstream, with the highest-profile releases being a slate of new watches from Garmin, Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus, and they’ve been as popular as ever. Look beyond those big releases, however, and interesting new stuff is out there. A subscription-free WHOOP competitor band was launched by Polar, while Core Devices, the resurrected Pebble watch company led by its original founder, unveiled a pair of watches inspired by the original Pebble designs, complete with low-power LCD-style screens, and open-source software that anyone with the know-how can tinker with. Core Devices also launched a new kind of smart ring with a button and a microphone, which the company says acts as “external memory for the brain”. Elsewhere, the AirPods Pro 3 now have built-in heart rate sensors, and Meta teamed up with Garmin to bring us the Oakley Meta Vanguard sports specs. Cool new wearable innovations are happening, but it all still feels quite fringe. My innovation of the year, however, came from Google. The Google Pixel Watch 4 is the first properly repairable smartwatch, as you’re able to take it apart and replace the battery and display. This enables you to change individual parts rather than the whole watch, reducing your contribution to e-waste, and saving you money in the long run. Almost every other piece of wearable tech from every other company is still a sealed unit that will ultimately end up being disposed of, and I hope Google's move could be the catalyst for change that the wasteful wearable tech industry sorely needs. The biggest story of 2025 broke late in the year, and it concerned off-screen studio machinations rather than on-screen drama. Netflix’s $82.7bn bid for Warner Bros. sent shockwaves through the industry when it was announced in early December, and provoked a counter-bid from Paramount Skydance. There’s still a long way to go before a deal is approved, but should Netflix acquire one of the film world’s most iconic studios it would be a landmark moment for the streaming sector, and would represent a seismic shift for the entertainment industry as a whole. Turning to the year's big theatrical releases, and numerous new movies flopped at the box office, including some with huge names attached (I’m looking at you, Dwayne Johnson and The Smashing Machine). Heck, with Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts*, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps all underperforming, even the usually reliable Marvel Studios didn’t have a money-spinning hit on its hands. I wonder how many people predicted that animated and live-action/CGI hybrids would rule the theatrical roost, led by multi-billion dollar-spinning flicks like Lilo & Stitch, Zootopia 2, and Ne Zha II… As for the major streaming services, users endured more of the now-customary annual price hikes, while Max raised eyebrows by rebranding itself – again – to HBO Max. On the screen, unexpected hits such as HBO medical drama The Pitt, plus Netflix's ‘one-shot’ drama Adolescence and pop-culture phenomenon Kpop Demon Hunters, proved that not even the savviest industry exec can really be sure what viewers will latch onto. Add in the return of unmissable shows including Severance and Stranger Things amid the glut of great and not-so-great film and TV releases, and there was plenty to keep our eyeballs engaged. Now, what have you got in store for us, 2026? It's been a slow but not insignificant year in home technology as legacy brands scramble to keep pace with bigger, already tech-savvy players vying for their spot in our homes – whether that's Breville reinventing the toaster with a proprietary optical sensor, IKEA launching new renewable energy solutions, or Eufy and Dreame duking it out to give us the most effective stair-climbing robot vacuum.Some brands were less innovative than others though. Dyson left some of us feeling snubbed with its 'new' (read: decade-old) vacuum, while Shark's TurboBlade Cool + Heat failed to impress despite its noble attempt at mimicking other SharkNinja product's viral fame. Elsewhere we saw big plays from Amazon and Google in the smart home space, with the arrival of their AI-bolstered home assistants. Amazon's Alexa+ and Google's Gemini for Home both entered Early Access beta in the US, and while the early reviews for both have been mixed, it's a promising glimpse into the future of the connected home. Both of those services are subscription-based offerings, and subscriptions look set to become a major battleground for smart-home brands, and a bone of contention between brands and their customers, as companies attempt to lock users into their ecosystems, as we've already seen with video doorbells. Between that, and brands like Samsung using screen-loaded appliances as advertising billboards around the home, now might be a good time to really think about which brands you want want to invest in as you build your smart home.

Title: Looking Forward into 2026 – Predictions for a New Year
URL: https://tagn.wordpress.com/2026/01/01/looking-forward-into-2026-predictions-for-a-new-year/

It is time again. Here we sit at the start of a new year and I am once again going to don the mantle of an oracle… false oracle to be sure, but let me do my cosplay… and foretell the doom of this next spin around the sun. And after 2025, I am in a foul mood. It is easy to be that guy who sees only the bad outcomes. As the quote goes: Always predict the worst and you’ll be hailed as a prophet. -Tom Lehrer, quoting a friend So you’ll have to pardon me if my 2026 predictions… and we’re back to predictions after 2025 failed to deliver on wishes in dramatic style… if they are not rife with sunshine and lollipops. Welcome to 2026 That said I once again want to remind people that predictions are not wishes. These are not things I want to come to pass. They are things I think are likely to come to pass given past behavior and the state of the industry and the economy overall. If I am bleak, it is merely because I have been conditioned by the world to have that point of view. For those wanting a past accounting… well, who am I to tell you what to do with your free time. But there is a history here. Now I am back around for another turn. So let’s get on with it. What will 2026 bring? 1. Bloodbath at Redwood Shores EA will be… well, I am not sure what it will be at the end of 2026. But I am pretty sure the Saudis will be getting out the bone saws once more and what was once EA will end up with more pieces cut off than Jamal Khashoggi corpse in the embassy in Istanbul. This seems like a gimme frankly. 2. More Microsoft Mayhem Phil Spencer has but two choices to keep his obscene annual bonus going. He either has to improve sales or he has to cut expenses. Given where the industry has been headed, and the unfavorable reaction to the price increase for the XBox Game Pass, I am going to bet on cost cutting. And what is the biggest expense? Employees. If they don’t cut at least another 1,000 staff from the XBox division I will be amazed. My final score on this one will be the percentage actually cut relative to 1,000. So nobody gets laid off, zero points. But if Phil axes 2,000 people, I am claiming 20 points. So basically, 0.01 points per person laid off. Sorry to value people at such a low rate, but at least I am not throwing them out in the street personally. 3. WoW Midnight Modest Launch We already have a date. I started sketching this post back in October and had a placeholder for the launch date, picking April 20th. But now we know it will be here on March 2, 2026, much earlier than I expected. So prediction alteration time! I am going to predict that there will be no follow up press release about how WoW Midnight was a huge success with cherry picked metrics to prove it was the best ever… WoW expansion with housing, for example, because I think Warlords of Draenor will probably still be ahead of it, and Tom Chilton telling us all that garrisons were housing counts in my book. I will allow no ret-con of that. 4. The Big Chill for WoW Classic My gut and intuition says that the J. Allen Brack “you think you do, but you don’t” faction gained ascendancy at Blizz when WoW Classic didn’t turn into a low-effort eternal cash machine. Between them dropping WoW Midnight on top of the WoW Anniversary Classic launch of The Burning Crusade and the retail team just straight up taking the nostalgia card for itself in the form of the remix seasons to fill out the fact that they cannot, after more than 20 years, make an expansion with two years of content (or make expansions faster FFS), WoW Classic seems on the outs. So my prediction is no new servers, no speeding up the languishing expansions, and absolutely no movement on anything that might feel even a bit like Classic Plus. WoW Classic Warlords of Draenor will land in the back third of the year and that will be it. I am going to claim five bonus points if Blizz puts out a roadmap and doesn’t bother to include and WoW Classic plans. 5. Nothing Else New in Irvine For all the resources they have and the mighty reputation they have earned for quality and polish and stealing ideas and reinventing them better, Blizzard will bring nothing new to the table in 2026. No announcements, no surprises, no additions to their lineup. They will be milking their current titles until the last layoff. See, doing something new is much higher risk than living on past glory. 6 . Lawsuit Wins for Against Pirate Servers Both Blizzard and Daybreak will win their cases against Turtle WoW and The Heroes Journey respectively. I think that is pretty much a gimme here. The case law is clear and none of the arguments offered justify taking another companies IP and assets to start their own business. Fan arguments in support of either made up requirements or different layers of “but I want it.” Now, will the win help the companies or actually shut down similar operations? Not a prediction that is part of the scoring, but I will say “no” on both counts. 7. A Rain of Tears in Norrath Ongoing poor performance by the aging stable of Daybreak titles is going to mean layoffs. Again, predictions are not wishes, but we’ve seen how this has gone in the past… and all the more so with Eros Capital Partners AB now heading the board following their demand for more cash payments straight to their pockets. This will be why, the explanation for my prediction below about an EQII special rules server for 2026. 8. H1Z1 is Still Dead Like the bit about Generalissimo Francisco Franco back in the early SNL days, H1Z1 is not coming back from the dead no matter how many times Ji Ham says to investors that it is an extremely important IP in the Daybreak portfolio. The promise of a new version of the game with a 2026 release will be revealed a fiction… or, more likely, not revealed at all as the Ji Ham is likely to pull a John Riccitiello SWTOR move and drop all mention and claim it isn’t what investors are interested in if pressed at the earnings call. 9. EverQuest 3 Same as H1Z1. It’s dead Jim… or Firiona… or whoever. Daybreak will only buy new titles, like Palia, but won’t make anything outside of their current MMO lines. We probably won’t KNOW it is dead, but it will be the old school Daybreak treatment of never mentioning it again… certainly not in 2026. 10. EverQuest Special Rules Server for 2026 The EQ team is under some pressure. Numbers are down and The Heroes Journey was alleged to have been pulling in something around $100K a month for a dumbed down, multi-box, speed leveling version of the game. (Yes, there was more to it, but I swear that is all most people gushing about it seemed to mention.) That has to have made some impression on the team. Enough to get through their “Hardcore Heritage Forever” mindset? One hopes. What they should do is work on a “Tour de Norrath” special server. Bonus xp, mob health all dropped to make most things soloable at level, even by a warrior who can only shield bash and kick with their auto attack, with expansions being dropped at a dizzying rate; something like 8 weeks for vanilla and then 4-6 weeks for every expansion thereafter. Raids will be sized so that a group of three can do them, save for the Sleeper, who will require a full group. What they will do is turn the dials they already have… xp rate, unlock rate, starting expansion… and pretend they have done something new and innovative. It will not thrill. [I wrote this before we got the news about what Daybreak was planning, but now we know that. so how it plays out will be the biggest part of any scoring.] 11. EverQuest II Special Rules Server for 2026? Nope! We’re not going to get one for 2026. Reasons noted above, but also their popularity has not been established the way the EQ versions have. 12. Norrath Expansions All the same, both EQ and EQII will announce Q4 expansions that will riff off of some location we have visited already. That seems like a safe bet even with the last part. Not a 100% gimme this time. 13. LOTRO Difficult Issue Avoidance SSG has made it clear that they are going nowhere near the scourging of the Shire until they have milked the rest of the appendices of the series completely dry of content and they have trivialized the breadth of Middle-earth with murder for hire and FedEx quests. They’re like the Borg of Middle-earth, and all must be assimilated. But I think they have gone far enough south into Harad. They will need to go in another direction. So, my prediction in three parts; there will be an expansion (2 points), it will ship in December (2 points), and it will be set in the east, somewhere along the shores of the Sea of Rhun (6 points). Fight me! 14. New Eden: Two Expansion, Two Events, One Fanfest EVE Online will follow the now well set pattern of days, with a spring and fall (or summer and winter to use their terms, but May and November aren’t summer or winter where I live) expansion and the Crimson Harvest and Winter Nexus events… and Fanfest. And that will be the roadmap for 2026. Anything else will just be some login rewards, Twitch drops, and a cash shop sale. 15. New Eden to Remain Just EVE Online Neither EVE Vanguard nor EVE Frontier will progress to the point of even an early access launch. The former will remain the wet dream of a few key individuals at the company who still want to will this into being after 15 years of failure. It isn’t going to happen. The latter… well, CCP simply won’t be able to solve the economic contradictions of blockchain, which tries to pretend that supply and demand isn’t a thing. But they cannot drop it due to Marc Andreeson’s money paying the bills, but doing what Andreeson wants will drive any actual gamers away, leaving just the speculator class looking for another get rich quick scheme. If they ship, they die, so they will continue to pretend to be trying to solve the problem while cashing Andreeson’s checks. 16. Drone Regions Consolidation One of the big changes in New Eden this year was the evacuation of the Drone Regions of null sec and the subsequent land rush by smaller groups to grab territory there. There were about 20 groups on the map at one point. That has already slimmed down to 14. By the time we get around to scoring this I am going to say there will be just three groups, either alliances or recognized coalitions of alliances, in the Drones. 17. NetEase to Buy CCP from Pearl Abyss We got hints that CCP was being shopped around in 2025 and, frankly, there are few suitors that make as much sense as NetEase. They already run the EVE Online server in China as well as EVE Echoes. Why not buy the whole thing? They don’t have to close the deal in 2026, they just have to announce it. I mean, the gaming press acts like any such announcement means the deal is complete anyway, so why fight it? The only alternatives are Tencent buying them or Crimson Desert being a smash hit. I’ll give myself a couple points for either of those options just because I mentioned them. But it has to be NetEase for the full 10 points. 18. The Crimson Desert Blahs Years in the making… and promising… we have a ship date for Crimson Desert at last. March 19th. And, frankly, they had better make that date. What then? Will this be the massive hit with rave reviews that restores the fortunes of Pearl Abyss and allow them to hold onto CCP while getting out from under their bad investments. I don’t think so. But how to quantify that for a prediction? Well, thanks to Fantasy Critic League, I now pay attention to review scores. So I will go with that. Crimson Desert is going to land with an Metacritic review score of 80, which is the honorable mention, fine work but not outstanding bracket a lot of game land in. So a score of 80 gets my a full 10 points, but I will tick off 2 points for each point its score goes above or below 80. That will be the partial credit metric. 19. The Perilous voyage of a Ship of Heroes I mean, they shipped their game. They got the business model completely wrong and now it peaks at 10 concurrent players on a good weekend. That is completely unsustainable. There will be no subscription requirement by the end of the year. That simply has to go. Big titles cannot sustain that, these guys certainly won’t make it work. That means it will go “buy to play,” will institute a free to play mode, or will simply shut down. But the subscription idea will die in 2026. Jan 2 addendum: Another one I wrote in October and then forgot to go edit. This already happened, I even wrote about it. So, zero points for predicting the past. Going to need one of those bonus predictions to land if I want a perfect 300 score! 20. Camelot Undone I see three paths forward for this incredibly late bloomer of a title. We’re already a dozen years past the promised ship date… still two years shy of the Duke Nukem Forever slip, but nothing to be proud of either… and the madness of Mark Jacobs is going to have to find an endgame somewhere. So my prediction, like Gaul, is divided into three possibilities. Given the complete lack of success of their other title, Final Bland: Ragnarok, which is now dead and gone, why would we believe Camelot Unchained is going to do any better. At some point investors are going to stop writing checks. The industry remains in a down cycle, investors are already skittish, further funding will look like throwing good money after bad. My special favorite because “Angry Marc” Andreeson, a man so lacking in self reflection that he has become the Pillsbury Doughboy parody of Sand Hill Road venture capitalist, has no interest in video games except to the extent that they further his desire to make even more unearned wealth by implementing a tax on the internet through blockchain. I am going to give myself 10 points if one of these comes to pass… but if Mark Jacobs manages to pull of a second I am going to grant myself a bonus five points, with a full 10 point bonus if he manages the hat trick. [This was the first prediction I wrote back in October, and I was in a bad mood. But it is so complicated, I am going to leave it as is in tribute to past me.] 21. Palworld Injunction Nintendo has been pissed about Palworld for quite a while now and has gone so far as to get patents approved that seem aimed and going after any title that emulates the whole “throw an object to catch a pet” idea that they see as the heart of its Pokemon titles. This year we’re going to get a resolution… and Nintendo is going to lose, having pushed too far while ignoring prior art. 22. No Man’s Sky 10th Anniversary We’ll get a bit update for the game’s tenth birthday. That goes without saying. And it will be a lot of cool stuff. But it won’t hit like Voyagers did with the introduction of corvettes. Peak concurrent users on Steam will be my measure for this. I am going to take stand at the 50K line and my score will go down 2 points for every 10K above that the game goes. This is one where I want to be wrong, but I have to look at history. 23. No Man’s Sky All About the Base Meanwhile, my stab at what we will get in 2026 is bases. The whole base building aspect of the game is a bit chaotic, tossed together, and feels like there is a lot of room to improve. So Hello Games is going to go all in on making sure you can make the space home of your dreams, with a landing pad that will work for your damn corvette already. 24. No Fire to be Lit Light No Fire will remain a ghost title for 2026. No dates, no early access, no roadmap, just vague news and nothing for players at all. 25. Guild Wars: Reforged Content Pack ArenaNet, caught by surprise by the success of Guild Wars: Reforged, will announce a content update for the game. It won’t be a whole new campaign, or even something as big as Eye of the North, but the game has demonstrated that there is demand for it, so why not give the players what they want? 26. Guild Wars 2 Expansion as Usual The pattern has been set, NCsoft expects the income, we’re just going to get another one. Probably in August. Seems about right. 27. No Official Announcement for Guild Wars 3 I mean, doesn’t ArenaNet have enough on its plate. There might be a leak or some discussion of a possibility of such an eventuality… I mean, they have to let GW2 sit untouched for a decade or so in order to go back and farm that the way they did the original… but we’re not there yet for a commitment. 28. The End of the New World as We Know It Amazon will announce the end date for New World. It might not end in 2026, but the end times will be marked in the calendar. We know it is happening and we know that Amazon isn’t going to do something like Dual Universe and make the game playable after the servers close. It will just be the end of days… so get started on that emulator now! 29. Squadron 42? More Like Squadron 86! Chris Roberts was absolutely positive that the long delayed Squadron 42 spin-off of the Star Citizen universe will ship in 2026. He says it is done and fully playable. There was even a special email update about it with “2026” in a huge size to emphasize the point. At this point I simply don’t believe him. No Squadron 42 launch… and I am going to give myself 9 point if we get some chickenshit “well, it is alpha now so you cannot criticize it” routine like we’ve had for Star Citizen for the last decade. Cloud Imperium has yet to ship a game and I don’t see that trend changing in 2026. 30. Not Coming Back Crowfall will remain dead. Alganon too. Seems like a gimme, but somebody out there believes these will return. Bonus Picks! Bonus picks are extra credit, wild ass guesses that don’t count against me if they fail to come to pass, but which get me some points if they somehow manifest into the real world. Bonus Pick 1 – AI to the Death Some studio… will it be you Krafton, or maybe this is a job for the petty and vindictive Tim Sweeney… will go all in on making a game with AI code, art assets, and audio. And it will crash and burn, becoming a complete disaster. This will need to be a big game. If you point out somebody did a tic-tac-toe title with AI, that isn’t going to count. This doesn’t mean somebody ruining their reputation by embracing AI publicly… again, Krafton, EA, and Tim Sweeney are already in that boat… but actually putting their money where there mouth is. Likewise, public revulsion and refusal to buy the game is out of bounds, it actually has to get reviewed and be announced to suck. The only reason this is a bonus pick is I am running a project that is using AI to code it and I have my doubts about the ability to produce anything complex. Bonus Pick 2 – Sports Betting Comes to EA! In looking at the Saudi purchase of EA, I am trying to figure out the upside financially. I mean, sure, the EA Sports franchise can spin money, but not enough to make the deal a net win. Meanwhile, sports betting apps are making so much money off of people that they are buying tons of ads during events to keep the gravy train running. And the Saudis know this. So I suspect that we’ll get some sort of announcement of an integration between EA Sports and gambling, likely first with the NFL, who will go along when the Saudis give them a cut. Summing Up So those are the predictions for 2026. That is 30 predictions to measure this year. Unless otherwise stated, each are worth 10 points, with partial credit available. I have a couple in there that could give me some extra credit, but we shall see if I get any of that. There are also bonus picks. I might add some more of those. But no ret-conning. I promise that. As always, the deadline is December 15th for things to come to pass. So if Amazon announces the end of New World on the 16th, I lose. But if Squadron 42 somehow ships on or after December 16th, I win, full points. That is a hard date. Now we’re off into the new year to see what becomes of us. I’d put one in place from my perspective: WoW private server (prospective) teams will have learned from Turtle WoW and won’t advertise or poke the bear, but instead will quietly continue to gain support for a Classic Plus on their own terms. If Turtle WoW didn’t do the stupid crap they were doing and essentially daring Microsoft to go after them, they’d still be around and doing Classic Plus their way. Other dev teams will learn from that and do their Classic Plus quietly. LikeLike 19. Ship of Heroes is already ‘buy to play’ in 2025. https://shipofheroes.com/new-low-price-no-subscription/ Do you get points for that? LikeLike Crap, you’re right. That was one of my early predictions and then they made the change and I already forgot I had written about it. Well, that will teach me to proof read. Zero points for predicting the past. I am already 10 points down! Let me go edit that so I don’t forget… AGAIN! LikeLike The only reason I didn’t predict PA selling off CCP in 2026 is the pride of the Pearl Abyss C-Suite. Selling the studio off that soon would be too great an admission that Crimson Desert failed. Also, bold prediction that EVE Vanguard doesn’t come out in 2026. If it doesn’t, Hilmar will be very upset. And probably the PA C-Suite because it might lower the value of CCP in a potential sale of the studio. As for Squadron 42, the largest minority shareholder (who owns 22% of CIG) just renegotiated the terms of his sale of his stock because SQ42 didn’t come out in 2025. The stock sale will happen in 2029 instead of 2028 and be based on revenue from 2026-2028 instead of 2025-2027. Another delay and things get really interesting.

Title: Crypto’s 2026 investment playbook: Bitcoin, stablecoin infrastructure, tokenized assets
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-investment-themes-2026-bitcoin-stablecoins-tokenized-assets
Time Published: 2026-01-01T18:00:00Z

After a volatile 2025, investors are rethinking crypto cycles. Here are three investment themes that will shape the market’s next phase in 2026. Cointelegraph in your social feed 2025 didn’t unfold the way many cryptocurrency investors expected. Although Bitcoin (BTC) peaked almost precisely in line with its historical four-year cycle, the long-anticipated blow-off top never materialized. Notably, Bitcoin’s gains failed to cascade into the broader market, leaving hopes for a full-fledged altcoin season largely unfulfilled. As a result, 2026 opens under a cloud of uncertainty. Investor sentiment is extremely negative, marked by caution and skepticism, even as the industry finds itself in an unprecedented position. For the first time in crypto’s 15-year history, institutions, corporations and regulators are largely moving in the same direction, laying the groundwork for broader adoption rather than actively resisting it. After a year defined by unexpected outcomes, identifying the most compelling investment opportunities for 2026 is no simple task. Still, a persuasive case can be made for focusing on assets and sectors with durable, long-term relevance, rather than relying solely on the predictability of four-year market cycles tied to the Bitcoin halving. There is also growing evidence that Bitcoin’s market structure has evolved. Institutional capital, with longer time horizons and stricter mandates, is increasingly influencing price action and liquidity dynamics. In doing so, these participants may be reshaping crypto market behavior, gradually shifting the narrative away from traditional drivers such as miners, long-term holders and Bitcoin whales. Against this backdrop, the following are three cryptocurrency investment themes worth watching in 2026. Related: VC Roundup: Big money, few deals as crypto venture funding dries up Bitcoin is now deep into its fourth halving epoch, and historically, the period following each halving has coincided with the most aggressive phase of the bull market. In prior cycles, Bitcoin typically reached its peak roughly 12 to 18 months after the halving, a pattern that has long shaped investor expectations. If history were to follow a familiar script, Bitcoin may have already marked its cycle high in October 2025, after climbing more than 600% from the 2022 lows. While such a move would be consistent with previous post-bear-market recoveries, it would still represent a comparatively modest gain relative to Bitcoin’s explosive early-cycle rallies, and would reinforce the notion of diminishing returns as the asset matures. However, not everyone is convinced that past cycles still apply. According to Bitwise analysts Matt Hougan and Ryan Rasmussen, Bitcoin may be on the cusp of breaking free from its long-standing four-year rhythm altogether. In 2026, “Bitcoin will break the four-year cycle and set new all-time highs,” they argued, pointing to structural shifts that are reshaping the market. In their view, traditional cycle drivers, such as halving-induced supply shocks, interest-rate volatility and highly leveraged speculative excess, carry less influence than they once did. While leverage remains a feature of crypto markets, its impact has diminished following a sharp deleveraging phase in late 2025, when a cascade of liquidations wiped out billions in open interest in October. That reset, they suggest, has reduced the probability of a classic blow-off top driven by excess speculation. More importantly, Hougan and Rasmussen see institutional capital as the defining variable of the next phase. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024 marked the opening salvo, but broader adoption may still lie ahead. “The wave of institutional capital that began entering the space in 2024 is likely to accelerate in 2026,” they said, as major wealth platforms such as Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch expand access and begin allocating on behalf of clients. A more accommodative monetary backdrop could reinforce that trend. Expected interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve would improve liquidity conditions, historically a favorable environment for risk assets, including Bitcoin. This view aligns with the research of Julien Bittel, a Chartered Financial Analyst at Global Macro Investor, who argues that Bitcoin is more closely tied to business and liquidity cycles than to halving schedules alone. “Based on our work on the business cycle, financial conditions and overall liquidity, the balance of probabilities suggests this cycle extends well into 2026,” Bittel wrote. “In that world, the four-year cycle is effectively dead.” Related: Bitcoin’s volatility below Nvidia in 2025 as investor base grew: Bitwise Beyond Bitcoin, few blockchain applications have demonstrated clearer real-world utility than stablecoins, digital tokens designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to fiat currencies such as the US dollar. Over the past 18 months, the stablecoin market has expanded rapidly, surpassing $300 billion in total circulation, led by dollar-backed tokens such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC). What began as a tool for crypto traders has increasingly evolved into a foundational layer for payments, settlement and onchain liquidity. Regulation has played a central role in that transition. In mid-2025, US lawmakers advanced the GENIUS Act, comprehensive stablecoin legislation aimed at establishing clear rules for issuance, reserves and oversight. The framework, widely regarded as a turning point for the sector, aims to bring stablecoin issuers under a regulated regime while preserving their role in driving financial innovation. In parallel, US regulators have begun laying the groundwork for broader participation by the banking sector. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has proposed rule-making pathways that would allow regulated banks to issue payment stablecoins through approved subsidiaries, potentially integrating stablecoins directly into the traditional financial system. Within this evolving environment, stablecoins are increasingly viewed as a multi-purpose financial tool, enabling faster cross-border payments, facilitating onchain settlement and serving as the foundation for yield-bearing treasury instruments backed by short-term government debt. Policymakers have also framed stablecoins as a mechanism for reinforcing the global role of the US dollar, particularly in regions where access to dollar-denominated banking remains limited. That trend is not confined to the United States. Stablecoins pegged to other fiat currencies, including the euro and various emerging-market currencies, are gaining traction, underscoring their potential role as a global settlement layer rather than a purely dollar-centric product. From an investment standpoint, dollar-pegged stablecoins themselves offer virtually no upside. By design, they are not meant to appreciate, and ideally should never deviate from their peg. The real opportunity lies in the infrastructure that supports them. That infrastructure spans a growing ecosystem of issuers, custodians, compliance providers, blockchain networks and payment rails responsible for minting, redeeming, settling and safeguarding stablecoins at scale. As adoption expands, so too does the value of the platforms enabling these functions behind the scenes. Exposure to this theme has also begun spilling into traditional capital markets. Circle, the issuer of USDC, made a high-profile public debut. At the same time, PayPal Holdings launched its own dollar-backed stablecoin, signaling that legacy fintech firms see stablecoins not as a niche crypto product, but as a core component of future payment infrastructure. Related: Bank lobby is 'panicking' about yield-bearing stablecoins — NYU professor When BlackRock’s Larry Fink, the chief executive of one of the world’s most influential asset managers, says the “tokenization of all assets” is beginning, markets tend to pay attention. For long-term investors, it also signals that a once-theoretical blockchain use case is moving decisively into the mainstream of finance. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has evolved rapidly from a niche experiment into one of the most institutionally driven sectors in crypto. Major financial players, including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Goldman Sachs, have already launched or participated in tokenized funds, bonds and settlement platforms, placing traditional assets directly onto blockchain rails. Industry data indicate that the tokenized RWA market reached over $30 billion in onchain value by 2025, with private credit and US Treasury–backed products emerging as early leaders. These instruments appealed to institutions seeking yield and faster settlement without abandoning familiar asset classes. More recently, the scope of tokenization has expanded. Tokenized stocks and equity-like instruments are gaining traction, particularly outside the United States, as exchanges and fintech platforms explore blockchain-based representations of stocks and exchange-traded products. Kraken’s rollout of tokenized equities for select international markets has highlighted growing demand for 24/7, programmable access to traditional assets. At the same time, crypto-native companies are positioning themselves for a future where tokenization is no longer peripheral. After Coinbase signaled its push into stock trading, Brian Huang, CEO of Coinbase-backed portfolio manager Glider, said the move could serve as a strategic on-ramp to the tokenized asset market. “Coinbase will have a huge leg up when assets truly begin to become tokenized,” Huang said, citing the exchange’s regulatory positioning and custody infrastructure. For investors, the appeal of RWAs lies less in short-term speculation and more in structural adoption. Tokenization promises faster settlement, reduced counterparty risk and global accessibility. As regulatory frameworks mature and financial incumbents expand their onchain offerings, RWAs could emerge as one of the most durable crypto investment themes heading into 2026.

Title: January 1, 2026

Time Published: 2026-01-01T16:00:16Z

Welcome to the New Year’s issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. We’re glad you’re here. Heraclitus, the famously elusive Greek philosopher, reminded his students that you cannot step into the same river twice. Both we and the river will have changed. According to legend, one of those students – snarky little barstid – replied: “I don’t think you can step into the same river once.” Even as we step, the river flows and changes. As do we. Heraclitus was speaking of a physical river. Centuries later, we have extended his insights to allow us to consider the River of Time itself: the continuous flow in which change happens, meaning accumulates, and our lives—and markets—actually unfold. January has that fluid quality. We think of ourselves standing on the bank of the River, looking backward and forward at once—convinced that the past can be measured and the future mapped, even as the present slips by almost unnoticed. The river does not pause for our resolutions. In reality, we don’t just get to watch time rush past; we are not on the bank, we are in the river. We may think we resolutely face the future, eyes upstream, scrying risk and opportunity. We may turn our back to the torrent, knowing that we can only know what has already passed and contemplating the dark sea into which it must eventually empty. We might be still and resolute, like a stone, or moving along with the flow. The young might experience a mere ankle-deep flow while some of us experience … the deeper currents pulling toward that wine-dark sea. Perspective matters. And metaphors matter because they teach us what to look for. From the riverbank, all motion feels alarming. From within the river, we begin to notice that not all movement means change, not all froth is consequential, and not all change arrives with noise. Some of what most shapes our lives—technological shifts, medical progress, environmental repair—moves steadily, almost invisibly, beneath the surface. This January issue of the Observer lingers over a stretch of the river that many hurried past. Amid the noise and anxiety of 2025, extraordinary things went quietly right: a vast expansion of green energy in China, meaningful progress against several endemic diseases, and other developments that rarely commanded headlines but may shape lives for decades to come. Uncertain times require clear thinking, and clear thinking requires … well, a functioning brain. In “New Year’s Resolution #1: Avoid lobotomies” we look at the threat that AI seductively poses to brains … yours, your alma mater’s, and your investment advisor’s. A short sidebar piece, “What Five AI Told Me About Investing in 2026, and what their answers tell you,” highlights the problematic patterns in AI’s response to an (admittedly unfair) question about what’s going to win in the year ahead. Our colleague Lynn Bolin contributes two complementary pieces exploring income-focused investing for the uncertain years ahead. In “My 2026 Investment Plan,” Lynn walks through the construction of his conservative Core TIRA portfolio – a traditional IRA designed to generate a steady income of at least 4% while limiting drawdowns to -15% during severe bear markets. He demonstrates how different funds yield differently depending on whether they’re responding to interest rate cycles or stock market cycles, and evaluates adding Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to improve diversification. Particularly valuable: Lynn’s analysis of how his portfolio performed through both the COVID bear market and the Great Normalization’s rising rates, and his discussion of why he’s moved from a 65% stock allocation to 50% as forecasts from the OECD, Federal Reserve, and Conference Board all point to slowing growth ahead. Vanguard’s own time-varying model now recommends a 40/60 stocks-to-bonds allocation – a near-revolutionary flip from the traditional 60/40. In “A Closer Look at Income Strategy,” Lynn drills deeper into the mechanics of generating steady income in an environment where short and intermediate Treasury yields are falling while long-term rates rise. Working from 30,000 feet (which Lipper categories produce income in low-yield environments) down to ground level (specific fund recommendations), he identifies funds that maintained consistent yields through multiple market cycles. His analysis reveals that some funds distribute more when stock market opportunities appear limited, while others fluctuate with interest rates – and a select few provide genuinely steady income regardless of market conditions. The payoff: an example portfolio that achieved 7.7% annual returns with a maximum drawdown of just -9.8% over the past six years while yielding 5.2%. The Shadow, as ever, surveys the month’s most consequential changes in the fund and ETF world in “Briefly Noted.” We also pause, briefly and with gratitude, to acknowledge those who have sustained the Observer—financially, intellectually, and through simple acts of encouragement. And then, before the current carries us onward, we raise a glass to what has been, to what is, and to what may yet emerge from upstream. Pessimism is easy. Way too easy, frankly. If I were to construct the Pessimism Industrial Complex, it would have three pillars: The federal government is controlled by toddlers, a bunch famous for tantrums when their irrational, I-am-the-universe demands are not met. And so we get the Trump Kennedy Center, chaired by Donald J. Trump and the Donald J. Trump US Institute for Peace. The Trump-class battleships that will populate The Golden Fleet. The Trump dollar coin. The Trump accounts for infants. The decision to make access to the national parks free on Trump’s birthday, which, I think, is somewhere in the month of Trumpruary. There are no adults left in the room. Interviews with three departing US senators made two points: (1) every member of the US Senate is appalled and (2) they’re all waiting “for the right time” to, you know, develop a spine, remember their oath of office, or something (“Why Won’t Senators Stand Up to Trump? We Asked 3 Who Called It Quits,” New York Times, 12/13/2025). Until then, the federal response to a global climate crisis is “don’t wanna and you can’t make me!” When you’re dealing with a creature named “The Doomsday Glacier,” it’s easy to foresee Bad Things Aplenty. The media loves reporting bad news. We don’t know where the newsroom adage “if it bleeds, it leads” originated – the confident online assertions about Hearst in the 1890s is unattributed and a random New York Magazine article in 1989 is laughably wrong – but it does express a well-documented truth. Bad news sells, terrible news sells more. A 20-year study of German media found a “significant, positive correlations between explicitly negative cover pages and the magazines’ sales” (Arango-Kure and Marcel Garz, “Bad News Sells,” Journal of Media Economics, 2014). Globally, every additional negative word added to a story’s title increases readership (Robertson, et al, “Negativity drives online news consumption,” Nature: Human Behavior, 2023; btw, their study of 105,000 online news stories also found that positive words in titles drove down readership) and the more negative a story is, the more frequently and widely it’s shared on social media (Watson, et al, “Negative online news articles are shared more to social media,” Scientific Reports, 2024). You love to doom-scroll. Doom‑scrolling, for the three of you who didn’t know, is the practiced art of dragging your thumb down an endless feed of bad news long after you have stopped learning anything new. It is not just “reading the news online”; it is staying locked in the loop of crisis headlines, live‑updated horrors, and algorithm-driven outrage until your mood and sense of the world are thoroughly saturated. Some psychologists speculate that it’s a hard-wired behavior; within evolutionary time-frames, our survival depends on obsessively locating and assessing all potential threats in our neighborhood (“is that a nice kitty or a creature whose nickname for me is ‘niblet’?”), and doom-scrolling is just the latest iteration of the impulse. Surveys and behavioral studies suggest that a substantial minority of adults, and a flat‑out majority of younger users, now report doom‑scrolling regularly (“Gen Z has a doomscrolling problem,” Newsweek, 5/11/2025). In those same studies, heavier doom‑scrolling is consistently associated with higher levels of stress, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and even secondary trauma symptoms, a joy of witnessing wave after wave of misery through a four‑inch screen (Satici, et al, “Doomscrolling Scale: its Association with Personality Traits, Psychological Distress, Social Media Use, and Wellbeing,” Applied Research in the Quality of Life, 2022). And, boy howdy, is there a fair number of regrettable developments in the world. Andrew Winston’s curiously optimistic essay in Forbes (“2025: the year sustainability didn’t die,” 12/21/2025) began with a fairly bracing list of negatives: … the harsh reality is the world’s greatest challenges [are] getting worse. Inequality grew, especially at the very top, where individuals amassed unfathomable wealth (hundreds of billions of dollars) and some corporate valuations hit unreal heights ($4 trillion to $5 trillion). Meanwhile, climate impacts escalated; political winds don’t change actual winds. For example, part of Los Angeles burned to the ground (at an estimated cost of up to $250 billion) during unprecedented wildfires, historic heat baked India, Pakistan, and the EU, and devastating floods in Texas killed dozens of children. Scientists told us that climate change is “beyond scientific dispute,” at “tipping points,” and “extremely dangerous” (and that the world will blow past the 1.5C warming target). Insurer Allianz issued an eye-popping report that climate change could “destroy capitalism.” In addition, the world got less democratic and pulled to the right and generally away from the sustainability agenda, making collective action even harder. This puts more pressure on businesses. And even facing headwinds, sustainability didn’t die. That’s the top story of the year. Let’s look at that and some other big themes. Well … yeah. But if pessimism feels effortless at the end of 2025, that is not just because the news is bad; it is because you are mainlining it, in real time, on an interface designed never to run out. Much of our success as a species is driven by two factors: a good plan and resilience in executing it. The media’s business model tends to emphasize doom because, well, doom sells. But 2025 offered remarkable evidence that when we commit to sustained action—plugging ozone holes, protecting beaches, installing solar panels, developing breakthrough medicines, restoring ecosystems—we can achieve transformations that once seemed impossible. In our draft letter, what follows are eleven pages of incredibly consequential, positive developments. Chip’s anguished plea, “have mercy on their eyes!” led us to share the news in two forms: a dozen bullet points here and a dozen pages of detail in a sidebar story entitled, “The Big Box of Delights.” So here’s what happened while doom was scrolling: In November, a liquor store employee in Virginia discovered broken bottles and an apparently intoxicated raccoon sleeping on the store’s bathroom floor. An animal control officer noted that he fell through a ceiling tile, “went on a rampage, drinking everything,” with a special fondness for … umm, whisky. The animal showed no signs of injury, according to local animal protection services, though they guessed the raccoon might be grappling with “a hangover” and regret over “poor life choices.” Figure 1: Raccoon regretting its poor life choices. Source: NBC News. The story delighted readers across the political spectrum—a rare moment of shared laughter in a divided time. But it became more than a viral moment when merchandise commemorating the raccoon’s night of debauchery raised a quarter of a million dollars for the local animal shelter that housed him. The Hanover County animal protection service teamed up with apparel maker Bonfire to create shirts, sweatshirts, cups, and stickers featuring the now-infamous image of a raccoon spreadeagled next to a spilled booze bottle, along with the words “Trashed Panda.” Through 12/22, they’ve sold 19,764 against a goal of 20,000. The drunk raccoon reminds us that hope sometimes arrives in unexpected forms: in a hungover raccoon that brings people together, in merchandise that funds animal care, in our capacity to find joy and meaning in the absurd. On Christmas Day, Pope Leo made his traditional papal “Urbi et Orbi” address, Latin for “To the City and to the World,” which summarizes the bad news (see above, plus your danged doomscroll) and prescribes a response: put aside indifference, stop scrolling and start acting, stand with the oppressed rather than the oppressive. “There will be peace when our monologues are interrupted and, enriched by listening, we fall to our knees before the humanity of the other.” Stop wasting our time demonizing one another? Dreamer. Progress is rarely dramatic. It’s built day by day through the determined efforts of scientists, healthcare workers, conservationists, educators, and ordinary citizens working to solve problems both great and small. While 2025’s headlines often focused on conflict and crisis, millions of people worldwide continued humanity’s long tradition of quietly building a better world. They dreamt of better, and acted. The answer to “what’s there to be optimistic about?” is the same as it was in 2025, and will be in 2027: enormous things happened because millions of good people rejected the counsel of despair, and that you probably didn’t hear about because doom sells better than progress. The choice isn’t between naive optimism and realistic despair. It’s between staying informed about what’s actually happening—the turtle populations recovering, the emissions curves bending, the diseases being eliminated, the hungover raccoons raising money for animal shelters—and letting a curated feed of catastrophe convince you that nothing good is possible. Step away from the mediated world and step into the immediate one. Put your phones away. Hug someone today. Smile at a stranger. Do a good deed. Read a book. We recommend Always Remember (2025), a singularly beautiful little 30-minute read that reminds you of important things you already know but need to hear. Subscribe to Nautilus, a site (and magazine) that reminds you that science is cool … and important. Consider joining The Conversation, a site that has actual researchers write clear articles about important topics (“Deepfakes leveled up in 2025. Here’s what’s coming next.”) Be like Jimmy the President. Be like Leo the Pope. Be like the Drunken Raccoon. Make a difference where you are. (Want cool pictures, more detail, and a couple more stories? Open “The Big Box o’ Delights.” Or, if you’re in the long-scroll version, just keep scrolling!) The question’s not hypothetical, at least for investors. In truth, you have no idea of what’s coming. If you knew, you’d be richer than Croesus. Two things are true when we stand in the river of time: we can see neither the river’s bottom nor what’s coming at us from just around the bend. The bottom might fall out. The torrent might be nearly upon us. We cannot know, but we’ve still got to act. In general, the guides that professionals use are called “capital market assumptions” – data-driven estimates of the range of likely outcomes given current inputs. “Given a CAPE of 40 and capex spending of X, the likeliest range of US equity returns over the next 3-5 years falls between…” The recommendations that flow from those assumptions are called “strategic asset allocations,” statements that say broadly “a prudent investor with an intermediate time horizon should plan on holding X% in equities, with the possibility of some adjustments as markets evolve.” The problem is that there are a million factors weighing on markets, but not all million – birth rates in Nigeria? thawing permafrost in Siberia? financial nihilism in Gen Z? – can be incorporated into the models. Different trillion-dollar advisors reach very different trillion-dollar conclusions about what course to chart. Two of the largest firms – BlackRock and Vanguard – seem to have reached starkly different conclusions about prudent investor behavior. Given Vanguard’s intrinsic conservativeness, their new recommendation seems particularly tectonic. Vanguard’s call: For investors with a medium-term outlook (3-5 years), flip the traditional 60% stocks/40% bonds allocation to 40/60. Same expected returns as 60/40, but with substantially less risk. Why? The S&P 500’s CAPE ratio sits at 40.40 – rivaling the dot-com bubble peak. Vanguard projects US equities will return just 3.5% to 5.5% annually over the next decade, while growth stocks (including the Magnificent Seven) may deliver only 2.3% to 4.3%. Meanwhile, bonds now offer 3.8% to 4.8% with far less volatility. Roger Aliaga-Díaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction: “We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity.” This isn’t panic or market timing. In a December podcast, Vanguard’s chief economists explained that “stay the course” never meant “never adjust your allocation.” It meant stay invested, avoid emotional decisions, but use evidence-based risk management. Their Time-Varying Asset Allocation model – driven by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model that processes decades of data on risk factors and returns – now suggests this is a moment for conservative asset allocation. They estimate a 25-30% probability that AI disappoints and fails to deliver on current expectations. Goldman Sachs concurs on muted US prospects, forecasting just 6.5% annual S&P 500 returns through 2035 – driven by earnings, not the multiple expansion that powered the last decade. They see better opportunities elsewhere: Emerging Markets (+10.9%), Asia ex-Japan (+10.3%), Japan (+8.2%). The “multiple expansion era” is over, they argue. Profit margins already jumped from 5% in 1990 to 13% today and can’t expand further. BlackRock takes the opposite view: Stay pro-risk, overweight US stocks on the AI theme. Yes, valuations are stretched, and concentration is concerning, but AI capital spending is transforming the economy at an unprecedented scale. The challenge isn’t whether to reduce equity exposure – it’s identifying which companies beyond the current winners will capture AI revenues as they spread across sectors. Their 2026 outlook emphasizes “the diversification mirage” – that traditional diversifiers like long-term Treasuries now offer diminished cushion, so seek idiosyncratic returns in private markets and active strategies instead. T. Rowe Price splits the difference: Neutral on equities overall but underweight US large-cap (-2.0%) while overweight small-cap, international, and emerging markets. They’re concerned about “the narrowness of AI trends” and prefer to position for market broadening. Like Vanguard, they’re underweight long-term bonds, worried about fiscal deficits keeping upward pressure on rates. What’s an investor to make of this? The honest answer is that nobody knows what’s upstream. Vanguard’s systematic approach says: when you can’t see around the bend, measure what you can – valuations, yields, historical risk/return relationships – and position defensively. BlackRock’s view: the AI build-out is real, the momentum is powerful, stay engaged but stay nimble. Both might be right over different time horizons. The shift isn’t just theoretical. Our colleague Lynn Bolin has reduced his overall stock allocation from 65% to 50% over the past year, positioning his conservative Core TIRA portfolio to weather what he expects will be a more turbulent second half of the decade. My own long-term allocation, which we discuss each February along with my portfolio, is 50/50. Research Affiliates, whose long-term asset allocation system has been broadly validated, offers striking support for the defensive shift. Their models project that a global 60/40 portfolio will deliver just 2.5% real returns over the next decade with a Sharpe ratio of 0.16. Their conservative model portfolio – shifting to 40% equity/60% bonds with commodities and inflation-linked assets – projects 3.5% real returns with a Sharpe ratio of 0.44. The more defensive portfolio projects higher returns with better risk-adjusted performance. Their analysis also reinforces Goldman’s geographic thesis: looking across asset classes globally, US large-cap growth shows near-zero risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio of -0.01), while developed ex-US large-cap value, emerging markets, and smaller international stocks all show meaningfully better prospects. The message is consistent: lighten on US growth, reduce overall equity exposure, look globally. The takeaway isn’t that one firm has discovered the answer. It’s that even trillion-dollar asset managers using sophisticated models reach honestly different conclusions from the same data. Vanguard says reduce equity risk because valuations are stretched and bonds are finally paying again. BlackRock says stay engaged because AI momentum is real and traditional diversifiers don’t work like they used to. Goldman says look elsewhere entirely – emerging markets and Asia offer better prospects than US equities. Research Affiliates’ models strongly favor the defensive positioning. Which suggests that broad diversification driven by your needs – not by greed or fear or the confident pronouncements of any single adviser – remains the most prudent course when standing in a river whose depths and currents we cannot fully know. The evidence from multiple independent sources supports a more conservative stance than the traditional 60/40 for those with intermediate time horizons. Whether that means 50/50, 40/60, or some other mix depends on your own circumstances, goals, and capacity to weather volatility. But the days of assuming that 60/40 will automatically deliver double-digit returns through multiple expansion and tech dominance? Those have already flowed past us.

To Andrew and Michelle Foster of Seafarer Capital Partners for their vision of a better kind of fund company, and their enduring success.

Title: My 2026 Investment Plan

I recently automated withdrawals from one conservative Traditional IRA (Core TIRA) into my short-term investment bucket for basic spending needs and emergencies. Previously, I automated withdrawals from a more aggressive Traditional IRA for longer-term discretionary spending needs. This exercise increased my focus on income. I just added Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) to my Core TIRA sub-portfolio as a lower-risk income fund rather than to pursue higher returns. The Core TIRA is conservate Traditional IRA, within the Intermediate Investment Bucket, that is intended to have long-term returns of 7% or more on average, have maximum drawdowns of -15% or less during a severe bear market, and provide steady income of at least 4%. This sub-portfolio has an allocation to stocks of 25%, but utilizes six funds classified as “flexible portfolio” or “alternative”. Now that I have completed the Core TIRA portfolio, I am preparing for a mid-2026 review when a bond matures and needs to be reinvested. In this article, I review historical distribution yields and look at the life-of-fund drawdowns and correlations. I evaluate the performance of the Core TIRA over the past five years with and without Standpoint Multi-Asset as a potential purchase, and compare the results against Vanguard Global Wellesley. I conclude with long-term views of the economy by the OECD, the Federal Reserve survey of professional forecasters, and a look at Vanguard’s time-varying portfolio. I wanted to understand the potential for the funds in my Core TIRA to produce a steady income of 4% per year. Some funds in the Core TIRA have yields, including capital gains, that fluctuate with the interest rate cycle, others that fluctuate according to the stock market cycle, and still others that provide a steady stream of income. I calculated the total distribution since 2019 by year from historical prices at the NASDAQ website and distribution history from Seeking Alpha. Yields for 2025 will change with end-of-year distributions. Table #1 shows the yields per year for each of the funds in my Core TIRA, with red shading indicating the lowest yield and blue shading the highest. All of the funds yielded at least 3.2% over the past six years, with PAIMX yielding 6.0%. Those whose inception date is after 2019 have the symbol highlighted in yellow. Three funds (FPFIX, JAAA, PVCMX) have higher yields when interest rates are high, and may have downward pressure on yields as interest rates fall. Those whose yield fluctuates more with the stock market cycle (PCBAX, AVALX, CTFAX) appear to have larger distributions when opportunities in the stock market appear to be low. PMAIX and PONAX have the most consistent distributions, with PMAIX having the potential for a higher total return. Of the two funds that I am considering adding in my mid-2026 review, EAGMX has high steady yields, while REMIX has a low correlation to the S&P 500 and bonds, and a higher potential for total return. Table #1: Historical Distribution Yield Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, Seeking Alpha, NASDAQ. The objective of the Core TIRA portfolio, including the bond ladder, is to provide steady returns and cash flow that grow with inflation into my Investment Bucket #1 for spending even through a secular bear market. Table #2 shows how funds in my Core TIRA have performed over their lives, sorted from lowest risk to highest. All of the funds had an APR of almost 4% or higher during their lives. “APR Min 10-yr Roll” shows the return for the worst ten-year rolling period within the life of the fund. The purpose of finding uncorrelated funds is to ensure that funds are not moving down at the same time. For long-term stability, I like CTFAX and PMAIX, which had “APR Min 10-yr Roll” of 4.7% or more. Table #2: Author’s Core TIRA Portfolio – Life of Fund Metrics Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I used Portfolio Visualizer to further analyze the Core TIRA portfolio for the past five years, including adding REMIX as shown in Table #3. I compare it to Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX), which I also own elsewhere. The link to Portfolio Visualizer Portfolio Backtesting is provided here. Table #3: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Figure #1 shows the growth of $10,000 invested in the Core TIRA with and without REMIX, and Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX). I like how REMIX fits into the Core TIRA portfolio, and it increases income. I own Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts for its professional management and simplicity. Figure #1: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer The funds can be loosely divided into three groups based on the past six years: 1) those that had low drawdowns (PVCMX, FPFIX, PCBAX, EAGMX), 2) those that had their maximum drawdown during The Great Normalization with rising rates (PONAX, PZRMX, CTFAX, and IAU), and 3) those that had their maximum drawdown during the COVID bear market (PMAIX, AVALX). Table #4 is the correlation matrix for the funds. They have low correlation with each other; however, PONAX, PZRMX, PMAIX, and CTFAX are moderately correlated. Table #4: Correlation Matrix Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer My conservative Core TIRA sub-portfolio consists of three funds classified as “alternatives”, three mixed asset funds in the “Flexible Portfolio” Lipper Category, and two in the “Multi-Sector Income” Category. I try to capture the objective and strategy of the funds below: Alternative Global Macro: Lipper Definition: Funds that, by prospectus language, invest around the world using economic theory to justify the decision-making process. The strategy is typically based on forecasts and analysis about interest rate trends, the general flow of funds, political changes, government policies, intergovernmental relations, and other broad systemic factors. These funds generally trade a wide range of markets and geographic regions, employing a broad range of trading ideas and instruments. Morningstar classifies PCBAX as “Macro Trading”, but EAGMX as “Nontraditional Bond”. Absolute Return: Lipper Definition: Funds that aim for positive returns in all market conditions. The funds are not benchmarked against a traditional long-only market index but rather have the aim of outperforming a cash or risk-free benchmark. David Snowball wrote Standpoint Multi-Asset Fund: Forcing Me to Reconsider in the November 2021 MFO Newsletter: “The fund provides exposure to equities (which help in times of economic growth or inflation), fixed income (which buffers deflationary periods and stock market declines), and commodities (which are uncorrelated with the first two, making it possible to minimize the effects of both sustained price changes and of an equity market decline). Half of the portfolio is invested in low-cost ETFs to give exposure to the global equity market. The argument is simple: over time, equities make serious money, especially if you don’t overpay for them. The fund holds eight equity ETFs charging between 3 and 7 basis points. The other half of the portfolio is managed futures positions. The positions can be in stocks and fixed income, as well as currencies and commodities. ‘Once a year we pull down the information on all the future contracts in the world, arrayed from most liquid to least liquid. We exclude the untradeable, then select the 75 most liquid in six sectors which includes equity index futures, bond futures, currencies, metals, energy, and agricultural commodities.’ Using a market following strategy, the futures contracts allow the portfolio’s exposure to equity markets to be increased beyond its 50% base (it was at 65% in mid-summer) or decreased to near zero.” Flexible Portfolio: Lipper Definition: Funds that allocate their investments to both domestic and foreign securities across traditional asset classes with a focus on total return. The traditional asset classes utilized are common stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Morningstar classifies PZRMX as “Global Conservative Allocation”, PMAIX as “Global Moderate Allocation”, and CTFAX as “Tactical Allocation”. In Figure #2, I compare Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) to PCBAX, PMAIX, and CTFAX. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) has a smooth, low-risk profile and yields 5.6%. EAGMX had a maximum drawdown of -3% during the Great Financial Crisis, while PCBAX had a drawdown of -29%. I bought PCBAX because it has returned 4.9% annualized since 2010, while EAGMX returned 3.4%. I favor REMIX for its low correlation to other funds in the Core TIRA. Figure #2: Comparison of Funds in Watch List to Core Funds in Portfolio Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. During the first half of this decade, the investment environment has experienced a lot of turbulence. I expect the second half to be more turbulent and have reduced risk accordingly. I recently attended the Economy Watch webinar by The Conference Board. They estimate that global growth will moderate over the next 15 years, and long-term growth in the U.S. will slow to less than 2.0%. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its OECD Economic Outlook, Volume 2025 Issue 2, which shows its estimates of real GDP growth in the U.S. to be below 2.0% in 2026 and 2027. The Fourth Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia estimates that real GDP will be 1.8% in 2026, 2.1% in 2027, and 1.8% in 2028. In my opinion, the U.S. economy is experiencing slowing growth in the late stage of the business cycle. Vanguard updated its time-varying portfolio in Bonds Remain In Favor In Time-Varying Model Portfolio. They describe it as, “The TVAA strategy is built on the framework of the Vanguard Asset Allocation Model (VAAM), driven by forecasts generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model (VCMM).” Their TVAA model results in a globally diversified 40/60 portfolio tilted toward value, as shown in Figure #3. The TVAA has an expected annualized 10-year return of 5.7%. Figure #3: Vanguard TVAA Model Source: Vanguard calculations, as of October 31, 2025 I use financial advisors at Vanguard to manage a portion of my portfolio using both index and actively managed funds. The time-varying strategy is not one of the options available. Over the past year, I have lowered my overall stock-to-bond allocation from 65% to 50% with a below-average allocation to technology because I expect stocks to have below-average returns. I invest in Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts, which has a 40/60 allocation, but also in Vanguard Global Wellington, which has a 60/40 allocation. I can sleep at night with the Bucket Approach and my Core TIRA account to meet essential spending needs and emergencies even in a secular bear market. During my mid-2026 review, I will ensure that sufficient funds are in place to meet 2027 withdrawals and confirm if I want to: 1) extend a rung in the bond ladder with iShares iBonds Dec 2034 Term Corporate ETF (IBDZ), 2) add Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to the Core TIRA, 3) increase the allocation to Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX) because of its focus on steady and high income, and 4) reduce investments in non-core bond funds. I don’t plan to sell any of the ten core funds in the Core TIRA. I wish everyone a happy and prosperous 2026. Lynn Bolin retired in June 2022 and is immensely enjoying the more relaxed lifestyle.

Star manager Tiffany Hsiao returned to Matthews Asia in mid-November after a stint managing a private fund for Artisan Partners. In mid-December, she was joined by two members of her team from Artisan. It does not appear that she’ll be responsible for individual funds just now but will, instead, work with Mark Headley and the existing Matthews managers “to generate new perspectives and insights across portfolios.” This is unalloyedly good news for Matthews investors, and we’ll reach out to Mark and Tiffany in the month ahead to see what she’s seeing. “The Wildermuth Fund is in liquidation pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) in June 2023. Additionally, in June 2023, the Fund suspended sales of Fund shares and quarterly repurchase offers,” with BW Asset Management brought on board to oversee the liquidation. Oddly, 30 months later, the fund has no audited financial statements, which might explain the lack of, well, liquidation? On June 1, 2026, three Baillie Gifford funds will become ETFs. Technically, these are mergers where a shell ETF is created, and it then acquires all of the assets and liabilities of a preceding mutual fund. On January 9, 2026, a series of BNY Mellon fixed income funds will become active, transparent ETFs with “the same management fee and an estimated lower total annual expense ratio” as their predecessors. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Impax Global Sustainable Infrastructure Fund will become the Impax Global Infrastructure ETF. The advisor expects a lower expense ratio will follow, but hasn’t offered any details. The Snowball ETF is in registration and has no connection with the Mutual Fund Observer or its editor. It is an actively managed ETF that will invest in U.S. securities and securities of issuers of foreign developed markets through ADRs. The ETF will be managed by Gabe Plotkin. Expenses have not been stated as of this writing. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Towle Value Fund (formerly the Towle Deep Value Fund) becomes the Towle Value ETF. Expenses will be capped at 0.85%. Vanguard announced the launch of its Vanguard Core-Plus Bond Index ETF (BNDP), a new fixed income offering designed to deliver broad, diversified exposure to the U.S. taxable bond market. It will have an estimated expense ratio of just 0.05%. Josh Barrickman will lead day-to-day oversight of BNDP. On the topic of Vanguard, it unveiled its first target date fund since 2003, when it offered its Vanguard Target Retirement series. The Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income series will follow the path of its flagship funds until age 55, when it begins allocating to the TIAA Secure Income Account, a savings annuity. A savings annuity lets you build up money over time and later convert it into an income stream for life backed by the insurance company. By age 65, the annuity portion will reach 25% of the portfolio, and investors can decide whether to convert that portion into lifetime income payments. This series will only be available through defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. Fees start at 0.08% for the mutual fund and can be lower for collective investment trusts, depending on plan size. The Invesco QQQ Trust has received approval to be reorganized from a unit investment trust to an open-end ETF. Trading of the reorganized ETF commenced on December 22nd. As part of the conversion, shareholders of Invesco QQQ will benefit from a decrease in the fund’s total expense ratio from 0.20% to 0.18%. The reclassification also provides the opportunity for Invesco QQQ to reinvest income and participate in securities lending. There will be no tax implications from this conversion for QQQ investors. Nope. All is well.

On December 8, 2025, AMG Montrusco Bolton Large Cap Growth Fund became the AMG GW&K Small Cap Growth Fund, which involves a complete strategy change from large cap to small cap and from non-diversified to diversified. The new management team has done a perfectly fine job running the AMG GW&K Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund for the past four years. On December 15, 2025, the $7 million Gabelli Automation ETF became the Gabelli Global Technology Leaders ETF. The plan is to become a global, all-cap fund that invests in companies with “market leadership and competitive advantages.” Effective after the close of business on February 13, 2026, the Goldman Sachs Balanced Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Conservative Allocation Fund, the Goldman Sachs Growth and Income Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to Goldman Sachs Moderate Allocation Fund, and the Goldman Sachs Growth Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Growth Allocation Fund. There will also be changes to the funds’ investment strategies, which shareholders should investigate. The GS filing did not specify what those changes will be, only that there will be changes and that paragraph 17 of the prospectus should be deleted in its entirety and replaced with … The $5 million Alger Weatherbie Enduring Growth ETF, a mid-cap growth ESG growth ETF, has already liquidated its portfolio and will cease operations on Christmas Eve 2025.

Rowe Price Capital Appreciation (PRWCX), and John Gillespie of T.

Crypto "died" again in 2025. Yet ETFs pulled $46B, stablecoin laws passed, and Vanguard reversed its crypto ban. Price collapsed; infrastructure won. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. 2025 delivered at least four distinct “crypto is dead” episodes: a January AI-induced flash crash, the October tariff liquidation that erased $19 billion in leveraged positions, months of altcoin carnage, and a fourth quarter slump that wiped out the year's price gains. Mainstream outlets dusted off “crypto winter” language each time. Bitcoin logged more obituaries by mid-year than in all of 2024, bringing the all-time tally past 470 since 2010. Yet, beneath the violent drawdowns and Twitter eulogies, the infrastructure kept building. Stablecoin legislation passed. Spot ETFs pulled in tens of billions. Major jurisdictions published actual rulebooks rather than issuing enforcement threats. The result is a year where crypto “died” repeatedly on price charts but quietly became more entrenched in global financial plumbing than ever before. The latest data from Bitcoin Is Dead show Bitcoin has ‘died’ 431 times, with gold bug Peter Schiff topping the Bitcoin obituary list. The first “crypto is dead” chorus arrived in late January, courtesy of Chinese AI model DeepSeek. On Jan. 27, a cross-asset sell-off hit tech stocks and bled into digital assets. A single session erased roughly $269 billion from the total crypto market cap and wiped out about $850 million in leveraged positions. Bitcoin dropped by more than 10%, from around $105,000 to below $98,000 in a matter of hours. AI-linked tokens fell up to 70% in a day. Analysts suggested that DeepSeek had punctured not just the AI bubble but the entire “risk-on” trade, with Bitcoin singled out as the bellwether whose rally suddenly looked fragile. The timing, barely a month into the year, gave the sell-off extra weight. The crash took Bitcoin only back to late-December levels, not into a bear market regime. Prices later set new all-time highs above $124,000 by July, then another peak in October. Market microstructure analyses framed it as the first major stress test of a more institutionally plugged-in crypto market rather than an existential failure, since the crash was driven by macro and AI repricing. The January episode looked scary in real time, but in hindsight, it played out like a violent shakeout inside a still-bullish tape. The biggest “crypto is dead” moment came on Oct. 10. President Donald Trump's surprise announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports during the thin weekend liquidity triggered what CoinGlass calls the largest liquidation event in crypto history. Estimates cluster around $20 billion of leveraged positions erased in under 24 hours, with more than 1.6 million accounts liquidated. Bitcoin fell from $121,000 to near $107,000 within hours, Ethereum plunged below $4,000, and many altcoins printed near-zero wicks as market makers pulled orders. The episode proved that crypto leverage and market structure were still dangerously fragile, despite the new ETF era. Policymakers explicitly used the event to argue that pending US market structure bills underestimated the systemic risk posed by crypto. JPMorgan identifies crypto-native leverage unwinding as the primary driver of the Bitcoin and Ethereum market downturn. The scale of the liquidations was larger than anything seen in prior cycles, including Terra/Luna or FTX, which made it easy to frame as a reckoning. Yet, prices didn't collapse to prior-cycle levels. Even after the rout and subsequent fourth-quarter slide, Bitcoin mostly traded in a $80,000-$100,000 band into year-end, well above the 2022-23 lows. Structure changed, not vanished. Derivatives open interest dropped by roughly 25% in a single day, but spot ETFs, custodians, and on-chain markets continued to function. Inflows into regulated products remained positive year to date, even after October. CoinShares tallies around $46.2 billion entering crypto ETFs in 2025, and BlackRock alone reports $74.8 billion in inflows to its digital asset ETFs as of Dec. 31. The October liquidation was the largest in history, but the institutional rails passed a stress test. Custodians didn't blow up. Exchanges stayed online. ETFs continued to process creation and redemption baskets. The plumbing worked, even as the speculative superstructure got demolished. Another thread in the “crypto is dead” narrative is the destruction in higher-beta sectors. AI tokens and memecoins took repeated beatings throughout 2025. During the January DeepSeek episode, many AI-linked coins fell 20% or more in 24 hours, with some recording intraday losses of up to 70%. Later coverage turned to “2025 meme and AI altcoin crash” angles, describing how sectors that led the early-year euphoria had given back most of their gains and, in some cases, round-tripped to pre-cycle prices. Trump-themed and election-related meme tokens saw heavy drawdowns as the year wore on. The memecoin wreckage was real and brutal, with hundreds of tokens that had spiked 10-fold or more in early 2025 finishing the year down over 90% from their peaks. This is the perennial story of speculative layers getting decimated while underlying rails consolidate. Chainalysis noted that DeFi TVL recovered significantly from 2023 lows even as hack losses and protocol blow-ups stayed below prior peak levels. The altcoin carnage was a feature, not a bug, consisting of a violent sorting mechanism that punished purely speculative bets while leaving infrastructure plays relatively intact. From mid-November into December, mainstream outlets wrote Bitcoin's obituary again. By mid-November, Bitcoin had fallen about 30% from its October record and given back its year-to-date gains. Mainstream finance publications framed it as erasing 2025 gains and asked whether Trump-driven optimism had run its course. Additionally, the term “crypto winter” was back in usage, which is the richest vein of “crypto is dead” language. 99Bitcoins data show Bitcoin had already logged more “obituaries” in 2025 by mid-year than in all of 2024, with at least 11 separate death declarations tracked by summer. The fourth-quarter slump gave critics ammunition. If the year started with euphoria over Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve and ended with prices lower than where they began, what was the point? Yet, the counterpoints are strong. Bitcoin ETFs are still $22 billion in inflows this year, and the historically hostile Vanguard reversed course in December, allowing clients to trade third-party crypto ETFs, citing market maturation. With $9.3 trillion under management, Vanguard’s entry into crypto ETFs could usher tens of billions in new demand despite modest initial allocations. Besides, Wall Street moved as generic SEC listing standards opened the door to multi-asset crypto ETFs, including products holding XRP, Solana, and even Dogecoin. For price context, Bitcoin's sub-$90,000 prints in November-December 2025 still leave it multiples above its 2022-23 lows and above its previous cycle top of roughly $69,000. That makes the “dead” label look more like exhaustion after a huge run than genuine collapse. To understand why crypto wasn't actually dead, it is necessary to zoom out from price. Elliptic's Global Crypto Regulation Review 2025 says governments shifted “away from enforcement-led approaches” toward comprehensive frameworks that prioritize innovation, highlighting moves like the US GENIUS Act stablecoin law and broader global alignment. Yellow's “Crypto Regulation Heatmap” tracks how MiCA in Europe, Hong Kong's licensing regime, the UK's reopening to exchange-traded crypto products, and a friendlier US stance collectively made 2025 the first year in which major markets had actual rulebooks rather than pure uncertainty. The SEC's generic listing standards, issued in September, streamlined the launch of new crypto ETFs across Nasdaq, Cboe, and NYSE Arca, allowing multi-asset products like Grayscale's GLDC to clear more quickly. Crypto ETFs registered billions in net inflows into crypto ETFs globally in 2025, even though late-year performance was poor. Away from trading, payment, and settlement rails, work continued to move forward. Visa and other large processors expanded stablecoin pilots on USDC rails for cross-border settlement, while stablecoins captured a growing slice of cross-border flows, particularly in emerging markets. The tension at the heart of 2025: the year produced more Bitcoin “deaths” on paper, record liquidations, and a sickly fourth quarter tape. However, it also established the first genuinely global regulatory frameworks, turned crypto ETFs and stablecoins into mainstream plumbing, and kept usage metrics well above those of any prior cycle. Crypto died four times in 2025, and each time it came back more embedded in the financial system than before.

Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. Monday’s PMI report is the first real macro gut-check of 2026. For Bitcoin, the only question is whether it reignites inflation fear. Daily volatility hit an all-time low of 2.24% as ETFs, corporate treasuries, and long-term holder redistribution transformed Bitcoin's market structure, making the asset less speculative, not less active. Wall Street’s sudden demand for cash looks suspiciously like 2019, but the data tells a deeper story. While retail fears volatility, this wallet is paying massive carry costs to hold a multi-asset book that requires a specific correlation to survive. BTCC's tokenized futures surpass expectations with $53.1 billion in annual trading volume amid industry-wide challenges.

Investing Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B), recently held large positions in Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), and Bank of America (BAC) stock. All three of these stocks check the boxes you would expect to see in Buffett’s investments, including reliable sales growth. Sending You to Google News in 3 © https://www.flickr.com/photos/fortunelivemedia/ As you may be aware, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is in a state of transition. Warren Buffett is retiring from his role as CEO, which will be taken over by Greg Abel. Thus, a legendary career is coming to a close. Still, you don’t need to dump your Berkshire Hathaway shares just because Buffett is retiring. Berkshire’s current portfolio currently reflects the carefully selected stock picks of Buffett and his associates. Thus, whatever’s in the company’s stock holdings list is worth considering. It may surprise you to learn that 50% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio consists of just three stocks. This fact is less shocking, however, when you see the three stocks as they represent top-tier businesses. So, without further ado, let’s reveal the three stocks that dominate Buffett’s portfolio right now. Buffett isn’t known for loading up on Magnificent Seven technology stocks very often. Yet, believe it or not, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock shares comprise 21.1% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio weighting. That’s a huge portfolio portion for just one stock, you must admit. All told, Berkshire Hathaway holds around 238.2 million AAPL shares, representing a 1.6% stake in Apple. Buffett usually doesn’t explain why Berkshire Hathaway bought a particular stock. Since he’s known as a value investor, we should be able to find a good value in Apple stock. This may not be immediately evident if we apply an old-school valuation metric, the trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Apple’s P/E ratio is 36.58x, which isn’t outrageously high for a Magnificent Seven company but also isn’t extremely low. Instead of focusing on the company’s P/E ratio, perhaps we should observe that Apple stock doubled over the past five years. Furthermore, Buffett surely knows that Apple is a reliable revenue grower. For example, Apple total net sales grew from $391.035 billion in the quarter ended September 28, 2024, to $416.161 billion in the quarter ended September 27, 2024. During that time frame, Apple recorded increases in iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services sales. Now, we’re starting to see how Apple stock can be a good value irrespective of Apple’s P/E ratio. At the end of the day, Apple’s value comes from the company’s steady growth and the stock’s consistent price appreciation. Therefore, if you believe in Buffett’s portfolio strategies, you might want to own some AAPL shares. Turning to the financial sector, Berkshire Hathaway holds approximately 151.6 million shares of credit card provider American Express (NYSE:AXP). Consequently, Berkshire owns a huge 22% stake in American Express. Interestingly, AXP stock takes up 18.4% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. Why would Buffett like this stock so much, though? Here’s a fact that might startle you. Whereas Apple stock has doubled over the past five years, American Express stock has actually tripled during that time. It just goes to show that financial sector stocks aren’t boring at all. Additionally, there may be a good value here as American Express’s P/E ratio is fairly reasonable at 25.1x. But again, we need to look beyond the P/E ratio. We can peek into American Express’s third-quarter 2025 results to see if the company is really raking in the revenue. As it turns out American Express’s Q3 2025 total revenue net of interest expense grew 11% year over year to $18.426 billion. Notably, American Express’s net interest income increased by 12%, “primarily reflecting growth in balances and net yield expansion.” Clearly, AXP stock isn’t just a safety play; it’s a growth investment, as well. With that in mind, you’re welcome to mimic Buffett’s portfolio and give American Express stock a try. To round out our list of the three stocks that make up 50% of Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings, we have another financial sector pick, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock. Comprising 10.2% of Berkshire’s portfolio, Buffet’s company owns more than 568 million shares of BAC. Berkshire Hathaway controls a 7.8% stake in Bank of America, so there’s no denying that Buffett believes in this famous banking firm. And in case you’re curious, Bank of America has a P/E ratio of 15.11x, which seems reasonable enough. Digging deeper than the P/E ratio, it’s worthwhile to see how Bank of America performed during the third quarter of 2025. The company’s total revenue, net of interest expense, increased from $25.345 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $28.088 billion in Q3 2025. It’s also worth noting that, during this time frame, Bank of America recorded increases in credit card and debit card purchase volumes, as well as in total home equity loan production. All in all, it was a solid quarter for Bank of America. Finally, it should be mentioned that Bank of America stock rallied 84% over the past five years, which is nothing to sneeze at. Hence, investors ought to take a look at BAC stock along with AAPL and AXP as great Buffett-backed buy-and-hold portfolio additions. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

For example, Apple total net sales grew from $391.035 billion in the quarter ended September 28, 2024, to $416.161 billion in the quarter ended September 27, 2024. During that time frame, Apple recorded increases in iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services sales. Now, we’re starting to see how Apple stock can be a good value irrespective of Apple’s P/E ratio. At the end of the day, Apple’s value comes from the company’s steady growth and the stock’s consistent price appreciation. Therefore, if you believe in Buffett’s portfolio strategies, you might want to own some AAPL shares. Turning to the financial sector, Berkshire Hathaway holds approximately 151.6 million shares of credit card provider American Express (NYSE:AXP). Consequently, Berkshire owns a huge 22% stake in American Express. Interestingly, AXP stock takes up 18.4% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. Why would Buffett like this stock so much, though? Here’s a fact that might startle you. Whereas Apple stock has doubled over the past five years, American Express stock has actually tripled during that time. It just goes to show that financial sector stocks aren’t boring at all. Additionally, there may be a good value here as American Express’s P/E ratio is fairly reasonable at 25.1x. But again, we need to look beyond the P/E ratio. We can peek into American Express’s third-quarter 2025 results to see if the company is really raking in the revenue. As it turns out American Express’s Q3 2025 total revenue net of interest expense grew 11% year over year to $18.426 billion. Notably, American Express’s net interest income increased by 12%, “primarily reflecting growth in balances and net yield expansion.” Clearly, AXP stock isn’t just a safety play; it’s a growth investment, as well. With that in mind, you’re welcome to mimic Buffett’s portfolio and give American Express stock a try. To round out our list of the three stocks that make up 50% of Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings, we have another financial sector pick, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock. Comprising 10.2% of Berkshire’s portfolio, Buffet’s company owns more than 568 million shares of BAC. Berkshire Hathaway controls a 7.8% stake in Bank of America, so there’s no denying that Buffett believes in this famous banking firm. And in case you’re curious, Bank of America has a P/E ratio of 15.11x, which seems reasonable enough. Digging deeper than the P/E ratio, it’s worthwhile to see how Bank of America performed during the third quarter of 2025. The company’s total revenue, net of interest expense, increased from $25.345 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $28.088 billion in Q3 2025. It’s also worth noting that, during this time frame, Bank of America recorded increases in credit card and debit card purchase volumes, as well as in total home equity loan production. All in all, it was a solid quarter for Bank of America. Finally, it should be mentioned that Bank of America stock rallied 84% over the past five years, which is nothing to sneeze at. Hence, investors ought to take a look at BAC stock along with AAPL and AXP as great Buffett-backed buy-and-hold portfolio additions. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

The session was marked by extreme sectoral divergence, with the automobile index surging over 1 per cent on robust December sales data, even as the FMCG sector plunged more than 3 per cent following the imposition of fresh excise duty on cigarettes. The trading day witnessed the narrowest intraday range since September 2025, with the Nifty moving within a mere 84-point band, reflecting subdued participation amid global market holidays and continued foreign institutional investor selling. Market breadth remained neutral with 2,211 stocks advancing against 1,952 declining on the BSE, where 4,335 stocks were actively traded. As many as 144 stocks hit their 52-week highs, while 87 touched their 52-week lows. ITC emerged as the session’s biggest casualty, crashing 9.69 per cent to ₹363.95, wiping out massive investor wealth as cigarette stocks reacted sharply to the new excise duty announcement. Other notable losers included Tata Consumer Products, which declined 1.57 per cent to ₹1,173.30, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories down 1.53 per cent at ₹1,252, Bajaj Finance falling 1.13 per cent to ₹975.60, and ONGC slipping 1.03 per cent to ₹237.90. “The domestic market started the year with a range-bound session and ended slightly higher amid thin trading due to global holidays and continued FII selling,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments Limited. “Sectorally, auto stocks gained on strong December sales, while value buying supported IT stocks. However, overall advances were capped as FMCG stocks declined following the newly imposed excise duty on cigarettes.” The automobile sector provided the session’s bright spot, with Bajaj Auto leading the gainers’ pack with a rally of 2.59 per cent to ₹9,585. Shriram Finance advanced 2.39 per cent to ₹1,020, NTPC climbed 1.99 per cent to ₹336.10, Eicher Motors gained 1.98 per cent to ₹283.55, and Wipro rose 1.52 per cent to ₹267.30, reflecting strong investor appetite for quality stocks backed by solid fundamentals. Broader markets outperformed the benchmark indices, with the Nifty Midcap 100 rising 0.44 per cent to 60,750.45, gaining 265.95 points, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 closed marginally lower by 0.05 per cent at 17,704.90. Among sectoral indices, Nifty Bank gained 0.22 per cent to close at 59,711.55, Nifty Financial Services advanced 0.19 per cent to 27,666.80, and Nifty Next 50 jumped 0.45 per cent to 69,675.40. “Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a range-bound trading session,” noted Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities. “Among sectors, the Auto Index was the top gainer, rallying 1 per cent, whereas the FMCG index corrected sharply, shedding over 3 per cent.” From a technical perspective, analysts maintained a cautiously optimistic outlook. “The zone of 26,200-26,240 will act as an important hurdle for the index,” said Sudeep Shah, Head of Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities. “Any sustainable move above the 26,240 level will lead to a sharp upside rally in the index up to the 26,400 level in the short term.” Looking ahead, market participants expect volatility to pick up as attention shifts to the upcoming third-quarter earnings season and Union Budget expectations. “In the days ahead, Q3 earnings, budget expectations, and global cues such as the India-US trade deal and potential Fed actions are expected to guide market direction, with earnings growth likely to remain the key driver in 2026,” Nair added.

Title: Crypto ETFs Defy The Pullback With $32 Billion In Fresh Investor Cash

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to Farside Investors data, US investors put close to $32 billion into US crypto exchange-traded funds in 2025 even as markets lost steam late in the year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs drew the biggest share, with $21.4 billion in net inflows. That is smaller than the $35 billion that poured into Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, IBIT, accounted for most of the activity. Reports show IBIT took in about $24.7 billion. That makes its inflows roughly five times larger than the nearest rival, Fidelity’s FBTC. Market watchers noted IBIT ranked near the top among all ETF flows, placing behind only a few broad index funds and a big treasury bond fund. If IBIT’s number is removed, the wider spot Bitcoin ETF group actually finished the year with about $3 billion in combined outflows. Grayscale’s Bitcoin product lost nearly $4 billion on the year. Bitcoin’s price was lower than at the start of 2025; it began the year around $93,500. Based on reports, interest in Ethereum ETFs was real, but the momentum looks uneven. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, ETHA, sits at nearly $12.6 billion in inflows. Fidelity’s FETH follows at $2.6 billion, while Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust ETF holds about $1.5 billion. Still, public on-chain data showed little renewed demand for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the last month of the year, suggesting flows may slow into 2026. Ether ETFs benefited from being new and giving investors a regulated way to own ETH, but recent days have seen quieter buying. Spot Ether ETFs, which only became widely tradable after their July 2024 launch, gathered $9.6 billion in their first full year. Spot Solana ETFs, launched in late October, added $765 million through year end. Litecoin and XRP ETFs also began trading in the latter half of the year, giving investors more choices for regulated altcoin exposure. The sums are small compared with Bitcoin and Ether. Solana’s $765 million is an example of early interest that has not yet turned into a large, steady stream of assets. These products are being tested by the market. Industry trackers reported that crypto ETFs listed worldwide experienced $2.95 billion in net outflows in November, and there was about $179 billion invested in crypto ETFs globally at the end of that month. Regulators and exchanges moved faster this year under new SEC leadership that was more open to approvals, which in turn helped institutional adoption in the US. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Nigel Williams, the firm's head of talent acquisition, has a few pieces of advice for those hoping to nab one of the coveted acceptance letters. Williams said that college students interested in working at the asset management behemoth should do four things before preparing for an interview: research the firm, have a personal elevator pitch, brainstorm specific examples of success, and reach out to an employee beforehand. With their "elevator pitch," Williams said, applicants should explain what's important to them, where they excel, and how they've overcome difficulties or solved problems. "Why would you be great for the company? Being able to give an example, be specific," Williams said, adding that general statements don't tend to land as well. Researching the firm will help applicants anchor their chosen examples in what BlackRock in particular is looking for. Part of what defines the firm, Williams said, is relationship-building. Many applicants know or reach out to someone who works at BlackRock before the interview to learn about the company culture, he said. Last year, more than 60,000 people applied for the early-career programs, and BlackRock offered some 1,500 jobs globally for its internship and program analyst positions. Every applicant completes a one-way HireVue interview. For those who do make it further into the application process, Williams said he's always interested in learning about "what makes people tick," whether by having them talk through what they've learned from solving a challenging situation, or asking about what they would have done differently. As BlackRock continues to accelerate its technological prowess, Williams also said that AI has transformed his hiring process. Strong applicants can demonstrate both their fluency with AI tools and prompting, and their interpersonal skills. When it comes to younger talent, Williams said he's not just looking for a certain GPA or major, but also those who are engaged in their school communities. BlackRock has, for example, had a lot of success when hiring student athletes. Of those who do make it into the summer intern program, around 75% receive offers to return as analysts after graduating from college, which may be especially helpful in a brutal job market for young talent.

Title: Nvidia Is About to Deliver a Huge Late Christmas Gift to Investors
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2026/01/01/nvidia-is-about-to-deliver-a-huge-late-christmas-gift-to-investors/
Time Published: 2026-01-01T09:44:37Z
Full Content:
Investing Nvidia (NVDA) reportedly received orders exceeding 2 million H200 chips from Chinese tech companies for 2026 delivery. Current inventory stands at only 700,000 units. Nvidia asked Taiwan Semiconductor to ramp up H200 production starting in Q2 2026 to address the shortfall. H200 chips are priced at $27,000 per unit for China-specific variants. Shipments could help recover billions in lost Chinese sales from this year. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Although Nvidia‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares jumped 38% over the course of 2025, reflecting strong early-year momentum driven by artificial intelligence (AI) demand, the second half of the year was something of a disappointment: The stock largely traded sideways as questions about slowing growth, supply constraints, competitive pressures, and valuation grew. It was the equivalent to investors waking up Christmas morning and finding Nvidia had given them a lump of coal in their stocking. However, as we prepare to turn the page into 2026, Nvidia may be about to deliver a belated gift to shareholders, one that promises a substantial stock price increase through expanded production and sales. It could be a real present for patient investors, one that brightens the prospects for the year ahead and beyond. According to an exclusive Reuters report, Nvidia has approached its manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), to dramatically increase the output of the H200 AI chips in response to surging demand from Chinese technology companies. Sources say that these firms have placed orders exceeding 2 million H200 units for delivery in 2026, but with Nvidia’s current inventory standing at approximately 700,000 chips, it created a significant shortfall that prompted the outreach to Taiwan Semiconductor. The H200 is based on Nvidia’s Hopper architecture and produced using Taiwan Semiconductor’s 4-nanometer process. As the second most powerful chip in its portfolio, one that is vastly superior for training complex models than the dumbed down versions Nvidia made to comply with U.S. export restrictions, it also indicates Chinese companies view it as a better option than other regional or locally produced chips. Nvidia has requested that Taiwan Semiconductor begin fabricating additional chips, with production slated to commence in the second quarter of 2026. While the precise volume of the new order remains undisclosed, this step aims to address the gap between Nvidia’s existing inventory and the incoming orders, giving the chipmaker time to ramp up to meet the demand. With the initial shipments fulfilled from its current stock, the first deliveries could potentially arrive before the Lunar New Year in mid-February 2026. This timeline builds on earlier reports the Trump administration authorized the shipment of H200 sales to China again. Pricing for the China-specific H200 variants has been set at around $27,000 per chip, according to the sources, positioning them as a viable option for Chinese buyers seeking high-performance AI hardware amid limited alternatives. This production ramp-up occurs as Nvidia shifts its attention toward its newer Blackwell series and the forthcoming Rubin chips, which are expected to drive future growth. The emphasis on H200 expansion, however, highlights China’s continued role as a major market, even as trade barriers have previously reduced Nvidia’s presence there. A Nvidia spokesperson stated that the company manages its supply chain on an ongoing basis. They added, “Licensed sales of the H200 to authorised customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States.” Yet the shipments could strain global AI chip availability, as Nvidia must allocate resources across regions while meeting heightened Chinese demand. Taiwan Semiconductor declined to comment on the matter, and China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to Reuters inquiries. Investors shouldn’t get too hopeful just yet. The Reuters report relies on anonymous sources and lacks official confirmation from Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, or Chinese regulators, and Beijing has not approved any H200 imports. However, if the report proves true, this could help Nvidia regain traction in China, countering the billions of dollars in lost sales it recorded this year, and the $5.5 billion writedown on its chip inventory it took. Renewed chip sales to China could also be the first step in regaining its lost market share, while delivering a late Christmas gift to investors. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Investors funnel $32B into US crypto ETFs despite year-end pullback

BlackRock further separated itself from competitors in the crypto ETF market in 2025, with its Bitcoin and Ether funds, IBIT and ETHA, accounting for the majority of net inflows. Cointelegraph in your social feed US investors poured over $31.77 billion into US crypto exchange-traded funds in 2025 despite the crypto markets stumbling towards the final months of the year. US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs took the lion’s share of investor interest, accumulating $21.4 billion in net inflows in 2025, according to Farside Investors data. However, it marks a fall from the $35.2 billion net inflows seen in 2024. Spot Ether (ETH) ETFs saw a fourfold increase in inflows from 2024, attracting $9.6 billion of investor money in the year. Ether ETFs launched in July 2024, meaning 2025 was the first full year the ETFs could be traded. Spot Solana (SOL) ETFs were among the new crypto products to hit the US market in 2025, which have tallied $765 million since launching in late October. Institutional adoption has been supported by a more crypto-friendly administration this year, including new Securities and Exchange Commission leadership, which accelerated approvals for new crypto products. BlackRock strengthened its dominance in the crypto ETF market in 2025, with its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) seeing a staggering $24.7 billion worth in inflows to end the year. IBIT’s flow tally is now five times larger than the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), its nearest competitor. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in mid-December that IBIT ranked sixth in net inflows among all ETFs, trailing only broad index funds and a treasury bond ETF. “If you can do $25b in [a] bad year imagine the flow potential in [a] good year,” he said, noting Bitcoin’s slight fall from $93,500 at the start of 2025. Removing IBIT from the equation, the nine other spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined $3.1 billion in outflows for the year. Most other spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a marginal increase in net inflows, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF bled around $3.9 billion. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) continues to dominate the Ethereum ETF market despite failing to record an inflow over the last 12 trading days. ETHA’s inflows currently sit at almost $12.6 billion, while The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) round out the top three at $2.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. Glassnode data shows that spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have shown little to no renewed demand over the past month, suggesting these crypto products may see a slow start in 2026. Litecoin (LTC), Solana and XRP (XRP) ETFs also launched in the back half of the year, giving investors greater access to major altcoins through regulated investment vehicles. Industry analysts expect an explosion in the number of crypto ETPs approved in 2026 under the SEC’s new generic listing standards, which no longer require that each application be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Might happen at [the] tail end of 2026 but likely by the end of 2027,” Seyffart said in December.

Title: For platforms, here’s what’s not going to happen in 2026

TikTok existing in the U.S. beyond the realms of a legal ban, Meta winning its antitrust trial, and Omnicom partnering with X were not quite on Digiday’s bingo card for 2025. Which is to say that trying to predict, especially in the world of tech and platforms, what might actually materialize at any time, let alone next year, is nearly impossible. After all, a lot of what the industry thought might happen in 2025, just didn’t. Which is why Digiday has taken a slightly different approach to 2026. Instead of predicting what might happen, here is what Digiday believes won’t actually happen in next year. However long it takes (12 months and counting), the U.S. deal with China over TikTok cannot live in limbo forever. But in the meantime, marketers are simply getting used to living with its uncertainty. As Brainlabs’ managing director of paid social, Michelle Wiltz put it, the political theater around TikTok isn’t designed for resolution but for leverage. Both governments benefit from keeping the ambiguity alive. “2026 won’t deliver a clean answer about TikTok’s U.S. ownership,” she said. “Instead, it will reinforce a new operating reality: geopolitical ambiguity is a feature, not a bug and smart marketers plan for resilience, not resolution.” Nothing has come close to what Twitter was in terms of TK. Even as X, its real-time factor is its USP — something no platform has been able to replicate. And while ads are already being tested on Threads, it’s still a long way off from getting the type of attention that warrants it becoming a viable advertising track in its own right, rather than a nice add-on placement in Meta’s Advantage+. As Collective Measures’ group director of performance media, Lauren Beerling noted, Twitter wasn’t just a text-based feed, it was heavily driven by journalists, politicians, breaking news, and cultural urgency. “Threads is intentionally avoiding that energy, meaning it won’t inherit the same commercial value,” she said. “Meta seems far more focused on making Threads a ‘pleasant conversation app’ than a real-time newswire. That will attract users, but not the intent or immediacy that generates big ad revenue.” This year was probably one of Snap’s strongest years yet. By the end of Q3, the company had made $1.51 billion in quarterly revenue. But when compared to that of its peers: Meta, YouTube, TikTok — it’s still a drop in the ocean. Basis Technologies’ client strategy and insights partner, Colleen Fielder made the point that eMarketer estimated Snap will only claim 2.1% of social ad spend in 2025. “Snap’s alternative revenue paths feel limited — the Bitmoji subscription is fairly surface-level and while there’s a lot of buzz around a Perplexity partnership, it’s far too early to treat that as a major revenue engine,” she said. Plus Australia’s ban on users under 16 and an ongoing lawsuit with the city of New York — both complicate growth and advertiser confidence. A dramatic profitability jump next year seems unlikely.” Throughout 2025, there’s been an underlying narrative: AI equals efficiency, so headcount should decrease. Except the latest industry layoffs proved that they weren’t necessarily designed to cut costs on headcount, but to open up additional revenue for AI spending. “Companies will continue to use AI to reduce labor costs — especially at the top, where efficiency narratives sell well to boards and CFOs,” said Brainlabs’ managing partner of retail, Dan Connor. “What will slow is the belief that high spending itself equals progress. Companies will stop equating massive AI budgets with innovation; 2026 is the shift from exuberance to efficiency.” Everything we’ve seen so far points to one thing only: it’s no longer IF OpenAI builds an ad business, it’s when. That’s been indirectly confirmed by CEO Sam Altman himself, head of applications Fidji Simo, the latest hires of chief revenue officer Denise Dresser and Christina MacDonald — lead counsel for ads in ChatGPT. Platforms don’t make moves without intention. “Even with the recent ‘Code Red’ which caused OpenAI to pause the ads rollout to focus on product quality, the groundwork is clearly being laid,” said Robert Kurtz, strategic business outcomes partner at Basis Technologies. “2026 feels like the year they start testing ads in earnest.” Back in April, Judge Brinkema sided with the DOJ that Google held illegal monopolies. By September, the closing stage of Google’s ad tech antitrust trial saw the DOJ target the platform’s ad tech stack — AdX. While it’s not asking for a total divestiture, pulling the exchange apart would weaken its ad server. Google’s remedies argued that the DOJ’s proposals are excessive, and offered alternative solutions — it simply wouldn’t take the result lying down. Still, that’s not to say the judge will agree, and the ultimate outcome isn’t expected until next year. Retail media exploded in 2025, creating a more complex environment for everyone. And it looks set to continue next year. “I expect continued fragmentation in 2026 with a few players growing faster, but not true consolidation yet,” said Haley Feazell, vp of global media at Mindgruve. “Real shakeouts are likely later, once growth slows, and operating costs rise — similar to the timeline we’ve seen with CTV, is my expectation.” Similarly, Basis Technologies’ evp, integrated client solutions, Amy Rumpler added that consolidation certainly won’t occur in some of the larger networks that have more advanced capabilities, and ad revenues, already realized (think CVS and Kroger). “The benefits to them owning and operating their own independent networks, where they profit off of O&O inventory and audience data, is too far along to entertain consolidation with another entity,” she said. “Unless the deal was massive (like Amazon buys all of Kroger and consolidates it with their Whole Foods brands), I don’t see it happening.” Potential investors spent 2025 at least considering the idea of buying Perplexity. Apple execs reportedly held internal talks about acquiring the AI company, as did Meta — though the latter decided to invest in ScaleAI instead. Still, what it does mean is Perplexity has spent much of the year in the shop window, while its attempts to scale its ad business barely got off the ground. But by partnering with major companies throughout 2025, such as Snap, PayPal, Pitchbook and Getty, improving its publisher monetization efforts, and releasing its browser, Comet, Perplexity has strengthened its product reach and increased revenue flow, which ultimately make Perplexity more attractive to investors or acquirers considering making an offer — and likely will next year. No one can deny that Amazon is a competitor to The Trade Desk, but it still isn’t a rival. And that’s because The Trade Desk is the DSP to the open web. It’s big enough that it hasn’t had to lower fees, and has focused on being a good partner to its agency clients. And while Amazon will continue to try and claw away at advertisers’ TTD budget (we’ve already seen from reports of Amazon offering like-for-like tests, funded by Amazon) as part of its wider aim for its DSP to become the backbone for the open web. YouTube showed its renewed confidence in live streaming with its latest product updates during its Made on YouTube event this year. And with the worries about AI overtaking creators and content, live actually bypasses those concerns. “Live is the most human format we have: messy, unedited, impossible for AI to fake convincingly (at least for now),” said Natalie Silverstein, chief innovation officer at Collectively. But more importantly, YouTube, for the most part, introduces features and tools with a long-term goal in mind. “I think it will work because everything they touch turns to gold,” said Shamsul Chowdhury, former Jellyfish exec and social media expert. “Live video has that rawness to it, almost like that added authenticity. And if they can have some brand safety measures, advertisers will play.” TikTok’s ownership drama has echoes of X (formerly Twitter), but ad performance has kept marketers for fleeing—for now. AI is altering agency business models. It’s altering the skills they’re hiring for and where they’re hiring them from, too.

Title: Beyond AI: 5 tech trends that will force you to pay more and rethink what’s ‘real’

Full Content:
When a friend and I recently got into a heated debate about artificial intelligence and its impact, I didn’t take sides. Instead, I countered his arguments with facts, even as he grew emotional and claimed that AI was the greatest enemy of humans. At the beginning of last year, I had already predicted that AI would be everywhere, and I was right. As a tech journalist, it comes naturally to me to observe key trends, anticipate the future, and form opinions. That said, it’s not my job to sell you something; influencers and YouTubers are already doing that very well. However, if AI defined 2025, this year is likely to be more decisive and unexpected, as artificial intelligence moves beyond chatbots and smartphones to create entirely new product categories — ones that had been teased for years but never truly materialised from a consumer perspective. But 2026 isn’t going to be about a single trend. It will be shaped by a mix of ideas, some of which may or may not work, but would stay and could shape the personal technology market and social media. I was scrolling through Instagram the other day when my eyes landed on a video featuring two babies engaging in playful banter (precisely the kind of content that gets maximum views in India) portrayed as a girlfriend and boyfriend. I must have watched a few of those short videos before realising they were generated by artificial intelligence, and only after paying close attention did I notice subtle changes that were barely visible without a side-by-side comparison. Since then, AI-generated videos have taken over my feed, especially clips of cartoony cats dancing to songs from Dhurandhar. I remember I joined Instagram (not officially, but through an invisible account) to watch videos of lion cubs, and now there are AI-generated versions of those videos as well, mostly funny and harmless. With platforms themselves encouraging AI videos, and tools like OpenAI’s Sora capable of generating videos of virtually anything in just a few minutes, millions of users will inevitably be fooled into thinking AI-generated videos are real. In India, hardly any such videos carry warning labels, making them almost indistinguishable from reality. That could pose a real problem, blurring the lines of what people can trust. This raises a serious question: it won’t be about whether you can tell the difference between what is real and what is not, but whether AI-generated videos change our relationships with other humans and affect how we perceive the world around us. The year has just begun, and I am already receiving feelers from my sources about an increase in smartphone and laptop prices, and it won’t be short-lived. The trend could continue for almost the entire year. For average buyers, phones already cost a month’s salary, and although many Indians purchase them on EMIs, ownership still comes at a hefty cost. Given the current shortage of memory chips, higher memory costs are likely to be passed on to consumers, which, in turn, will drive up the average selling prices of smartphones. This is primarily due to a shortage of memory chips, particularly dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), which is used in AI data centres and is also critical for smartphones. Lately, DRAM prices have surged as demand has outstripped supply, pushing up component costs. The biggest memory chip suppliers are prioritising data centre and AI companies that are flush with cash, and this shortage is expected to last until at least 2027. I am told that most smartphones launching early this year will be more expensive, though companies are likely to sweeten deals with tempting cashback offers and EMIs. I have also heard that smartphone prices, especially in the low- to mid-range segment, will rise once companies exhaust their existing stock. It is also possible for smartphone brands to launch phones with stripped-down RAM. Laptops, particularly gaming-focused models that are memory-hungry, may also see higher price tags. Enough of apps and the debate over whether to add a telephoto lens to a smartphone or how thin a phone can be. For 2026 and beyond, tech companies are pumped up to find ways to sell smart glasses for your face. While mixed-reality headsets never really took off and augmented reality glasses are still years away from becoming mainstream, in the immediate future (especially throughout this year) I foresee tech companies going all in on smart glasses, offering different capabilities such as small heads-up displays, AI features, built-in cameras, audio-only, and both tethered and wireless designs across varied price points, from mainstream and affordable to luxury. Meta has already proved that there is a market, even if still a tiny one, for smart glasses with its Ray-Ban and Oakley models. Others will follow suit and launch new smart glasses, ideally designed to be worn all day, every day. Just don’t expect smart glasses to replace your smartphone yet. However, tech companies are already plotting strategies to sell basic smart glasses that work as companions, much like your earbuds, smartwatch, or smart ring, and eventually reach a stage where they become as capable as a smartphone. Right now, whether you agree or not, smart glasses are exactly where feature phones once were, and it may take a long time before they become as advanced as modern smartphones. I may sound a bit futuristic, but this time I will take the side of Elon Musk. As the billionaire CEO has been saying for years, he envisions a world filled with humanoid robots. While that may not happen anytime soon, as mainstream adoption is still years away, there is growing interest among Silicon Valley companies and European startups in seriously considering humanoids as the next big thing. This also ties into how China has made humanoid robots a strategic priority in its tech battle with the US, though that’s a discussion for another day. For now, early investments in humanoids are likely to begin with experiments aimed at bringing home robots to consumers. Think of what Amazon did with Astro (a screen on wheels powered by the company’s Alexa voice software) a few years ago. The idea is to build robots with advanced cameras and computer vision software that can navigate homes much like self-driving cars. We will likely start hearing from the world’s biggest tech companies and consumer appliance makers about how they plan to bring AI-infused home robots as early as CES 2026, which takes place in Las Vegas in early January. Evidently, Apple is also interested in personal robotics, and is rumoured to be working on a tabletop AI companion described as an iPad on a movable robotic arm. It’s one space I am personally excited about, after seeing a humanoid robot in Shenzhen, China, last year. Let’s get it straight: foldables are an interesting product category, but I hardly see them as being very different from current smartphones. This may not sit well with many consumers, especially those who have invested in expensive foldables — I myself use a Pixel 10 Pro Fold and a Galaxy Z Fold 7. The main problem with foldables is the software, which, needless to say, holds them back and raises questions about whether the high price is justified. It’s definitely not the chunky, heavy build, an issue Samsung has largely solved or the price point, which Motorola has addressed more aggressively in recent years. Yes, the screen crease issue persists, and I hope it, too, gets resolved with the upcoming foldables. Personally, the user interface on foldables still underwhelms. I am pinning my hopes on Apple, which could finally solve the UI problem and improve how apps behave on a larger screen when it launches its first foldable this year – assuming the rumours turn out to be true. One way to address the software issue on a foldable iPhone would be to borrow elements from both iOS and iPadOS. It would be great to see desktop-grade apps that aren’t available on the iPhone, proper full-window multitasking, and optimal external display support on the iPhone Fold. That would be a dream iPhone for me, and I would be ready to leave my iPhone Air for it.

Saks Global is preparing shortly to file for bankruptcy after missing a debt payment related to its Neiman Marcus acquisition, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Journal noted that the high-end department store Saks Fifth Avenue did not make an interest payment of over $100 million on its bonds and is talking to creditors to secure financing for the bankruptcy process. Rising inflation and a weakening labor market have slowed discretionary spending for many consumers, including on luxury items. Saks Global has had many rounds of layoffs this year. The company aims to sell a minority stake in luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman to reduce its debt, a Saks Global spokesperson said in September to Reuters. It also aimed to raise cash through the sale of a Beverly Hills property. In August, the company restructured debt, which included $600 million in new money, and exchanged $2.2 billion in senior secured notes. The combination of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and other luxury retail and real estate companies aims to make it easier to compete with other department stores such as Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, and Macy’s. The deal was funded by new investors, including Amazon, Authentic Brands Group, Salesforce, and others, with $2.2 billion in senior secured notes as well as an asset-based credit facility.

Title: Trump and the end of American hegemony

New York: It has become almost routine to end each year with talk of the “polycrisis,” and to acknowledge the difficulty of anticipating a future that seems pregnant with the risk of new wars, pandemics, financial crises, and climate-driven devastation. Yet 2025 added a uniquely toxic ingredient to this mix: the return to the White House of Donald Trump, whose erratic, unlawful policies have already upended the postwar era of globalization. Faced with so much chaos and uncertainty, can we say anything with confidence about where the US and global economies are heading? One thing we can say is that the US economy is not doing as well as Trump, ever the con man, would have us believe. Job creation is almost at a standstill, which is no surprise, given that Trump has been sowing uncertainty and weakening the economy in unprecedented ways. On the supply side, his most pernicious policy has been the frontal attack on immigrant workers (and American workers with darker complexions more broadly). The administration’s mass deportations—carried out by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents snatching people off the streets—have killed off the most important source of additional labor supply at a time when the domestic labor force is declining. This matters for everyone, because not only do Americans depend on immigrants in industries ranging from agriculture and construction to hospitality and care work, but these immigrants are also a source of demand. Yet now, many Americans of color, even US citizens, are afraid to leave their homes, lest they be abducted and brutalized by ICE. The negative effects of Trump’s indiscriminate cuts to government have also spread throughout the economy. There are multiplier effects to government contractions, just as there are to expansions, and in the current context, the costs have been amplified by the erratic nature of the process. The administration’s incompetent, blunderbuss approach has sown even deeper uncertainty and induced precautionary behavior on the part of businesses and consumers. Trump’s tariffs—whether levied or threatened—and other on-again, off-again policies should be recognized for what they are: a major supply-side shock to the economy. They have pointlessly added uncertainty to the costs of production and to the prices consumers pay when they shop, making it impossible for businesses to engage in any serious long-term planning. And these are just short-term effects. The US economy’s long-term prospects look even bleaker, all thanks to Trump. After all, America’s comparative advantage has always rested on technology and unfettered higher education. By attacking research and trying to starve universities of federal funds unless they kowtow to his demands, Trump is shooting America’s economy in the foot. As numerous Nobel laureates in economics have emphasized, the “wealth of nations” lies in institutions, not least the rule of law. But Trump is trampling on the rule of law and replacing it with an extortionary regime of deal-making (and self-dealing), where government favors (like export licenses for Nvidia or subsidies for Intel) are granted in exchange for stakes in the company’s future profits. Of course, over time, Trump’s targets for extortion will dwindle. Having recognized the danger of relying on the United States, many countries are already pursuing new trade arrangements. Why, then, is GDP still growing (though not as robustly as it did under President Joe Biden), with the stock market reaching new highs and inflation remaining below the levels critics had warned about? There are multiple explanations for this apparent strength. With respect to the stock market, the boom is actually very narrow, confined largely to a handful of tech giants: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. And yet, these companies’ valuations reflect expectations of long-term monopoly profits that may never materialize. (This is especially true for Tesla, owing to Elon Musk’s embrace of Trump, which has alienated many consumers.) I am among the many commentators who see today’s valuations as the product of a bubble, one that has been sustaining not only the stock market but the entire economy. The massive capital expenditures on AI have been offsetting the weakness in the rest of the economy. But like all such bubbles, this one will eventually burst. Precisely when is anyone’s guess; but with so much of the economy riding on one sector, the collapse will inevitably be felt widely. Worse, if AI succeeds in the way its advocates anticipate, it would be a harbinger of other serious problems, because then the technology would likely displace many workers and cause even greater inequality. Add the downsizing of government demanded by Silicon Valley’s ersatz tech-libertarians, and one can only wonder what would sustain the US economy in the years ahead. As for inflation, there is a simple explanation for why it has not risen sharply yet. For starters, Trump’s tariffs generally have not been as high as he originally threatened (though the 50% punitive tariff imposed on India, a country the US had treated as a friend before Trump’s return, is shockingly brutal). Moreover, the effects of tariffs are often felt with long lags. Many firms refrained from raising prices until they saw what their competitors would do, and some won’t raise prices until the inventories of the goods they purchased before the tariffs are exhausted. But if Trump’s threatened tariffs against China were ever actually imposed, that would be a different matter. In fact, the unraveling of supply chains could unleash price increases greater than the tariffs themselves. That brings me to the critical question: What country would willingly subject itself to the whims of a mad king? It is not as if the US has a stranglehold on the supply of critical minerals or rare earths, without which the modern industrial age crumbles. It is not as if there aren’t markets elsewhere. The law of supply and demand works just as well without the US as with it. As Adam Smith and David Ricardo taught us, economic growth is about leveraging comparative advantages and economies of scale. But as Trump (and Russian President Vladimir Putin) has taught us, relying on unreliable trade partners can be enormously disadvantageous. Besides, the US is not as important as it used to be. It now accounts for under 10% of global exports. While some firms’ profits will suffer in a post-American global economy, others will benefit. While some workers will have to find alternative employment, others will find new demand for their skills. To be sure, the short run will not be easy. But in the new global economy that emerges over the longer term, America will have lost its hegemony. That is where we are heading as we head into the second year of living at the mercy of an unhinged president’s whims. The transition has already begun, and though global growth will suffer, the pain may be less than many fear. In Europe, for example, investments in rearmament—another byproduct of Trump’s self-destructive policies—will provide a major boost. Perhaps the defining moment will come with the 2026 US midterm elections in November. Elections that are not as free and fair as one would expect for a genuine democracy (as many fear) would mark a grim turning point. But if the growing dissatisfaction with Trump’s economic management and the country’s slide toward authoritarianism results in the Democrats recapturing at least one house of Congress, that will be a turning point in the other direction. Either way, the US and the world would still face at least another two years of economic incompetence and uncertainty. Joseph E.

Title: China pushes robot access mainstream with Qingtianzhu’s 1 RMB ‘flash rental’ service
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/31/china-pushes-robot-access-mainstream-qingtianzhus-1-rmb-flash-rental-service/
Time Published: 2026-01-01T00:29:06Z

UPDATED 19:29 EST / DECEMBER 31 2025 by Duncan Riley Though 2025 may be remembered for the artificial intelligence boom, not far behind has been the emergence of advanced humanoid robotics. And while the U.S. and the West more broadly have somewhat lagged in robotics, China enters the new year arguably well ahead in the robotics game. According to a report Tuesday from Chia-focused tech site Pandaily on New Year’s Eve, Chinese company Qingtianzhu (Shanghai) Technology Co. Ltd. has launched a “1 RMB robot rental” service across 10 major cities, marking one of the most aggressive attempts yet to normalize on-demand access to humanoid robots. 1 RMB is 14 cents in U.S. dollars. The initiative allows users to reserve humanoid robots for short-term use via QR code, with centralized scheduling designed to support deployment across multiple scenarios. The service is currently available in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, Suzhou, Xiamen and Chongqing. It’s positioned as a way to lower barriers to experimenting with humanoid robots in commercial and public settings. Sina Finance reported Tuesday that the 1 RMB price is a promotional entry point that is intended to attract first-time users and accelerate adoption rather than reflect the full commercial cost of robot deployment. Qingtianzhu describes the offering as a “flash rental” model with rapid booking, standardized service workflows and dedicated on-site personnel to ensure stable operation during events. The move is described by Chinese media as part of a broader effort to build a national robot leasing ecosystem. Qingtianzhu’s platform is acting as a kind of “robot Didi,” designed to match demand from businesses, exhibitions, conferences and brand activations with available robot inventory across cities. Didi is mainland China’s most popular ride-hailing service provider and is often described as the Uber of China. The long-term goal is reportedly to scale robot leasing in a way that mirrors ride-hailing and equipment-sharing platforms rather than traditional industrial procurement. The real significance of the initiative lies in distribution and utilization, not margins. The idea is that by encouraging frequent, short-term rentals, Qingtianzhu can gather operational data, refine deployment workflows and expose more customers to humanoid robots in real-world environments. The 1 RMB price could also be described as a loss leader to introduce people to the benefits of renting robots and over time, drive demand for higher-value rentals, long-term leases, or customized robotic services. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the idea of robot rental services is still a pipe dream, though some companies are getting closer with their robotic endeavors. Tesla Inc. debuted its Optimus robots in October 2024 to much fanfare, but not much has been heard of the offering since. With China surging ahead in robotics, companies in the West have a lot of catching up to do, but as AI continues to improve and hence the ability to control robots, 2026 should see more movement in the market. The dream that one day there will be a robot in every house isn’t that far off, albeit one far closer to reality in the Middle Kingdom than in middle America.

Title: 2025: The Year in LLMs

Full Content:
31st December 2025 This is the third in my annual series reviewing everything that happened in the LLM space over the past 12 months. For previous years see Stuff we figured out about AI in 2023 and Things we learned about LLMs in 2024. It’s been a year filled with a lot of different trends. OpenAI kicked off the “reasoning” aka inference-scaling aka Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) revolution in September 2024 with o1 and o1-mini. They doubled down on that with o3, o3-mini and o4-mini in the opening months of 2025 and reasoning has since become a signature feature of models from nearly every other major AI lab. My favourite explanation of the significance of this trick comes from Andrej Karpathy: By training LLMs against automatically verifiable rewards across a number of environments (e.g. think math/code puzzles), the LLMs spontaneously develop strategies that look like “reasoning” to humans—they learn to break down problem solving into intermediate calculations and they learn a number of problem solving strategies for going back and forth to figure things out (see DeepSeek R1 paper for examples). [...] Running RLVR turned out to offer high capability/$, which gobbled up the compute that was originally intended for pretraining. Therefore, most of the capability progress of 2025 was defined by the LLM labs chewing through the overhang of this new stage and overall we saw ~similar sized LLMs but a lot longer RL runs. Every notable AI lab released at least one reasoning model in 2025. Some labs released hybrids that could be run in reasoning or non-reasoning modes. Many API models now include dials for increasing or decreasing the amount of reasoning applied to a given prompt. It took me a while to understand what reasoning was useful for. Initial demos showed it solving mathematical logic puzzles and counting the Rs in strawberry—two things I didn’t find myself needing in my day-to-day model usage. It turned out that the real unlock of reasoning was in driving tools. Reasoning models with access to tools can plan out multi-step tasks, execute on them and continue to reason about the results such that they can update their plans to better achieve the desired goal. A notable result is that AI assisted search actually works now. Hooking up search engines to LLMs had questionable results before, but now I find even my more complex research questions can often be answered by GPT-5 Thinking in ChatGPT. Reasoning models are also exceptional at producing and debugging code. The reasoning trick means they can start with an error and step through many different layers of the codebase to find the root cause. I’ve found even the gnarliest of bugs can be diagnosed by a good reasoner with the ability to read and execute code against even large and complex codebases. Combine reasoning with tool-use and you get... I started the year making a prediction that agents were not going to happen. Throughout 2024 everyone was talking about agents but there were few to no examples of them working, further confused by the fact that everyone using the term “agent” appeared to be working from a slightly different definition from everyone else. By September I’d got fed up of avoiding the term myself due to the lack of a clear definition and decided to treat them as an LLM that runs tools in a loop to achieve a goal. This unblocked me for having productive conversations about them, always my goal for any piece of terminology like that. I didn’t think agents would happen because I didn’t think the gullibility problem could be solved, and I thought the idea of replacing human staff members with LLMs was still laughable science fiction. I was half right in my prediction: the science fiction version of a magic computer assistant that does anything you ask of (Her) didn’t materialize... But if you define agents as LLM systems that can perform useful work via tool calls over multiple steps then agents are here and they are proving to be extraordinarily useful. The two breakout categories for agents have been for coding and for search. The Deep Research pattern—where you challenge an LLM to gather information and it churns away for 15+ minutes building you a detailed report—was popular in the first half of the year but has fallen out of fashion now that GPT-5 Thinking (and Google’s "AI mode", a significantly better product than their terrible "AI overviews") can produce comparable results in a fraction of the time. I consider this to be an agent pattern, and one that works really well. The “coding agents” pattern is a much bigger deal. The most impactful event of 2025 happened in February, with the quiet release of Claude Code. I say quiet because it didn’t even get its own blog post! Anthropic bundled the Claude Code release in as the second item in their post announcing Claude 3.7 Sonnet. (Why did Anthropic jump from Claude 3.5 Sonnet to 3.7? Because they released a major bump to Claude 3.5 in October 2024 but kept the name exactly the same, causing the developer community to start referring to un-named 3.5 Sonnet v2 as 3.6. Anthropic burned a whole version number by failing to properly name their new model!) Claude Code is the most prominent example of what I call coding agents—LLM systems that can write code, execute that code, inspect the results and then iterate further. The major labs all put out their own CLI coding agents in 2025 Vendor-independent options include GitHub Copilot CLI, Amp, OpenCode, OpenHands CLI, and Pi. IDEs such as Zed, VS Code and Cursor invested a lot of effort in coding agent integration as well. My first exposure to the coding agent pattern was OpenAI’s ChatGPT Code Interpreter in early 2023—a system baked into ChatGPT that allowed it to run Python code in a Kubernetes sandbox. I was delighted this year when Anthropic finally released their equivalent in September, albeit under the baffling initial name of “Create and edit files with Claude”. In October they repurposed that container sandbox infrastructure to launch Claude Code for web, which I’ve been using on an almost daily basis ever since. Claude Code for web is what I call an asynchronous coding agent—a system you can prompt and forget, and it will work away on the problem and file a Pull Request once it’s done. OpenAI “Codex cloud” (renamed to “Codex web” in the last week) launched earlier in May 2025. Gemini’s entry in this category is called Jules, also launched in May. I love the asynchronous coding agent category. They’re a great answer to the security challenges of running arbitrary code execution on a personal laptop and it’s really fun being able to fire off multiple tasks at once—often from my phone—and get decent results a few minutes later. I wrote more about how I’m using these in Code research projects with async coding agents like Claude Code and Codex and Embracing the parallel coding agent lifestyle. In 2024 I spent a lot of time hacking on my LLM command-line tool for accessing LLMs from the terminal, all the time thinking that it was weird that so few people were taking CLI access to models seriously—they felt like such a natural fit for Unix mechanisms like pipes. Maybe the terminal was just too weird and niche to ever become a mainstream tool for accessing LLMs? Claude Code and friends have conclusively demonstrated that developers will embrace LLMs on the command line, given powerful enough models and the right harness. It helps that terminal commands with obscure syntax like sed and ffmpeg and bash itself are no longer a barrier to entry when an LLM can spit out the right command for you. As-of December 2nd Anthropic credit Claude Code with $1bn in run-rate revenue! I did not expect a CLI tool to reach anything close to those numbers. With hindsight, maybe I should have promoted LLM from a side-project to a key focus! The default setting for most coding agents is to ask the user for confirmation for almost every action they take. In a world where an agent mistake could wipe your home folder or a malicious prompt injection attack could steal your credentials this default makes total sense. Anyone who’s tried running their agent with automatic confirmation (aka YOLO mode—Codex CLI even aliases --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox to --yolo) has experienced the trade-off: using an agent without the safety wheels feels like a completely different product. A big benefit of asynchronous coding agents like Claude Code for web and Codex Cloud is that they can run in YOLO mode by default, since there’s no personal computer to damage. I run in YOLO mode all the time, despite being deeply aware of the risks involved. It hasn’t burned me yet... ... and that’s the problem. One of my favourite pieces on LLM security this year is The Normalization of Deviance in AI by security researcher Johann Rehberger. Johann describes the “Normalization of Deviance” phenomenon, where repeated exposure to risky behaviour without negative consequences leads people and organizations to accept that risky behaviour as normal. This was originally described by sociologist Diane Vaughan as part of her work to understand the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, caused by a faulty O-ring that engineers had known about for years. Plenty of successful launches led NASA culture to stop taking that risk seriously. Johann argues that the longer we get away with running these systems in fundamentally insecure ways, the closer we are getting to a Challenger disaster of our own. ChatGPT Plus’s original $20/month price turned out to be a snap decision by Nick Turley based on a Google Form poll on Discord. That price point has stuck firmly ever since. This year a new pricing precedent has emerged: the Claude Pro Max 20x plan, at $200/month. OpenAI have a similar $200 plan called ChatGPT Pro. Gemini have Google AI Ultra at $249/month with a $124.99/month 3-month starting discount. These plans appear to be driving some serious revenue, though none of the labs have shared figures that break down their subscribers by tier. I’ve personally paid $100/month for Claude in the past and will upgrade to the $200/month plan once my current batch of free allowance (from previewing one of their models—thanks, Anthropic) runs out. I’ve heard from plenty of other people who are happy to pay these prices too. You have to use models a lot in order to spend $200 of API credits, so you would think it would make economic sense for most people to pay by the token instead. It turns out tools like Claude Code and Codex CLI can burn through enormous amounts of tokens once you start setting them more challenging tasks, to the point that $200/month offers a substantial discount. 2024 saw some early signs of life from the Chinese AI labs mainly in the form of Qwen 2.5 and early DeepSeek. They were neat models but didn’t feel world-beating. This changed dramatically in 2025. My ai-in-china tag has 67 posts from 2025 alone, and I missed a bunch of key releases towards the end of the year (GLM-4.7 and MiniMax-M2.1 in particular.) Here’s the Artificial Analysis ranking for open weight models as-of 30th December 2025: GLM-4.7, Kimi K2 Thinking, MiMo-V2-Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, MiniMax-M2.1 are all Chinese open weight models. The highest non-Chinese model in that chart is OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120B (high), which comes in sixth place. The Chinese model revolution really kicked off on Christmas day 2024 with the release of DeepSeek 3, supposedly trained for around $5.5m. DeepSeek followed that on 20th January with DeepSeek R1 which promptly triggered a major AI/semiconductor selloff: NVIDIA lost ~$593bn in market cap as investors panicked that AI maybe wasn’t an American monopoly after all. The panic didn’t last—NVIDIA quickly recovered and today are up significantly from their pre-DeepSeek R1 levels. It was still a remarkable moment. Who knew an open weight model release could have that kind of impact? DeepSeek were quickly joined by an impressive roster of Chinese AI labs. I’ve been paying attention to these ones in particular: Most of these models aren’t just open weight, they are fully open source under OSI-approved licenses: Qwen use Apache 2.0 for most of their models, DeepSeek and Z.ai use MIT. Some of them are competitive with Claude 4 Sonnet and GPT-5! Sadly none of the Chinese labs have released their full training data or the code they used to train their models, but they have been putting out detailed research papers that have helped push forward the state of the art, especially when it comes to efficient training and inference. One of the most interesting recent charts about LLMs is Time-horizon of software engineering tasks different LLMscan complete 50% of the time from METR: The chart shows tasks that take humans up to 5 hours, and plots the evolution of models that can achieve the same goals working independently. As you can see, 2025 saw some enormous leaps forward here with GPT-5, GPT-5.1 Codex Max and Claude Opus 4.5 able to perform tasks that take humans multiple hours—2024’s best models tapped out at under 30 minutes. METR conclude that “the length of tasks AI can do is doubling every 7 months”. I’m not convinced that pattern will continue to hold, but it’s an eye-catching way of illustrating current trends in agent capabilities. The most successful consumer product launch of all time happened in March, and the product didn’t even have a name. One of the signature features of GPT-4o in May 2024 was meant to be its multimodal output—the “o” stood for “omni” and OpenAI’s launch announcement included numerous “coming soon” features where the model output images in addition to text. Then... nothing. The image output feature failed to materialize. In March we finally got to see what this could do—albeit in a shape that felt more like the existing DALL-E. OpenAI made this new image generation available in ChatGPT with the key feature that you could upload your own images and use prompts to tell it how to modify them. This new feature was responsible for 100 million ChatGPT signups in a week. At peak they saw 1 million account creations in a single hour! Tricks like “ghiblification”—modifying a photo to look like a frame from a Studio Ghibli movie—went viral time and time again. OpenAI released an API version of the model called “gpt-image-1”, later joined by a cheaper gpt-image-1-mini in October and a much improved gpt-image-1.5 on December 16th. The most notable open weight competitor to this came from Qwen with their Qwen-Image generation model on August 4th followed by Qwen-Image-Edit on August 19th. This one can run on (well equipped) consumer hardware! They followed with Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 in November and Qwen-Image-2512 on 30th December, neither of which I’ve tried yet. The even bigger news in image generation came from Google with their Nano Banana models, available via Gemini. Google previewed an early version of this in March under the name “Gemini 2.0 Flash native image generation”. The really good one landed on August 26th, where they started cautiously embracing the codename "Nano Banana" in public (the API model was called "Gemini 2.5 Flash Image"). Nano Banana caught people’s attention because it could generate useful text! It was also clearly the best model at following image editing instructions. In November Google fully embraced the “Nano Banana” name with the release of Nano Banana Pro. This one doesn’t just generate text, it can output genuinely useful detailed infographics and other text and information-heavy images. It’s now a professional-grade tool. Max Woolf published the most comprehensive guide to Nano Banana prompting, and followed that up with an essential guide to Nano Banana Pro in December. I’ve mainly been using it to add kākāpō parrots to my photos. Given how incredibly popular these image tools are it’s a little surprising that Anthropic haven’t released or integrated anything similar into Claude. I see this as further evidence that they’re focused on AI tools for professional work, but Nano Banana Pro is rapidly proving itself to be of value to anyone who’s work involves creating presentations or other visual materials. In July reasoning models from both OpenAI and Google Gemini achieved gold medal performance in the International Math Olympiad, a prestigious mathematical competition held annually (bar 1980) since 1959. This was notable because the IMO poses challenges that are designed specifically for that competition. There’s no chance any of these were already in the training data! It’s also notable because neither of the models had access to tools—their solutions were generated purely from their internal knowledge and token-based reasoning capabilities. Turns out sufficiently advanced LLMs can do math after all! In September OpenAI and Gemini pulled off a similar feat for the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)—again notable for having novel, previously unpublished problems. This time the models had access to a code execution environment but otherwise no internet access. I don’t believe the exact models used for these competitions have been released publicly, but Gemini’s Deep Think and OpenAI’s GPT-5 Pro should provide close approximations. With hindsight, 2024 was the year of Llama. Meta’s Llama models were by far the most popular open weight models—the original Llama kicked off the open weight revolution back in 2023 and the Llama 3 series, in particular the 3.1 and 3.2 dot-releases, were huge leaps forward in open weight capability. Llama 4 had high expectations, and when it landed in April it was... kind of disappointing. There was a minor scandal where the model tested on LMArena turned out not to be the model that was released, but my main complaint was that the models were too big. The neatest thing about previous Llama releases was that they often included sizes you could run on a laptop. The Llama 4 Scout and Maverick models were 109B and 400B, so big that even quantization wouldn’t get them running on my 64GB Mac. They were trained using the 2T Llama 4 Behemoth which seems to have been forgotten now—it certainly wasn’t released. It says a lot that none of the most popular models listed by LM Studio are from Meta, and the most popular on Ollama is still Llama 3.1, which is low on the charts there too. Meta’s AI news this year mainly involved internal politics and vast amounts of money spent hiring talent for their new Superintelligence Labs. It’s not clear if there are any future Llama releases in the pipeline or if they’ve moved away from open weight model releases to focus on other things. Last year OpenAI remained the undisputed leader in LLMs, especially given o1 and the preview of their o3 reasoning models. This year the rest of the industry caught up. OpenAI still have top tier models, but they’re being challenged across the board. In image models they’re still being beaten by Nano Banana Pro. For code a lot of developers rate Opus 4.5 very slightly ahead of GPT-5.2 Codex. In open weight models their gpt-oss models, while great, are falling behind the Chinese AI labs. Their lead in audio is under threat from the Gemini Live API. Where OpenAI are winning is in consumer mindshare. Nobody knows what an “LLM” is but almost everyone has heard of ChatGPT. Their consumer apps still dwarf Gemini and Claude in terms of user numbers. Their biggest risk here is Gemini. In December OpenAI declared a Code Red in response to Gemini 3, delaying work on new initiatives to focus on the competition with their key products. Google Gemini had a really good year. They posted their own victorious 2025 recap here. 2025 saw Gemini 2.0, Gemini 2.5 and then Gemini 3.0—each model family supporting audio/video/image/text input of 1,000,000+ tokens, priced competitively and proving more capable than the last. They also shipped Gemini CLI (their open source command-line coding agent, since forked by Qwen for Qwen Code), Jules (their asynchronous coding agent), constant improvements to AI Studio, the Nano Banana image models, Veo 3 for video generation, the promising Gemma 3 family of open weight models and a stream of smaller features. Google’s biggest advantage lies under the hood. Almost every other AI lab trains with NVIDIA GPUs, which are sold at a margin that props up NVIDIA’s multi-trillion dollar valuation. Google use their own in-house hardware, TPUs, which they’ve demonstrated this year work exceptionally well for both training and inference of their models. When your number one expense is time spent on GPUs, having a competitor with their own, optimized and presumably much cheaper hardware stack is a daunting prospect. It continues to tickle me that Google Gemini is the ultimate example of a product name that reflects the company’s internal org-chart—it’s called Gemini because it came out of the bringing together (as twins) of Google’s DeepMind and Google Brain teams. I first asked an LLM to generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle in October 2024, but 2025 is when I really leaned into it. It’s ended up a meme in its own right. I originally intended it as a dumb joke. Bicycles are hard to draw, as are pelicans, and pelicans are the wrong shape to ride a bicycle. I was pretty sure there wouldn’t be anything relevant in the training data, so asking a text-output model to generate an SVG illustration of one felt like a somewhat absurdly difficult challenge. To my surprise, there appears to be a correlation between how good the model is at drawing pelicans on bicycles and how good it is overall. I don’t really have an explanation for this. The pattern only became clear to me when I was putting together a last-minute keynote (they had a speaker drop out) for the AI Engineer World’s Fair in July. You can read (or watch) the talk I gave here: The last six months in LLMs, illustrated by pelicans on bicycles. My full collection of illustrations can be found on my pelican-riding-a-bicycle tag—89 posts and counting. There is plenty of evidence that the AI labs are aware of the benchmark. It showed up (for a split second) in the Google I/O keynote in May, got a mention in an Anthropic interpretability research paper in October and I got to talk about it in a GPT-5 launch video filmed at OpenAI HQ in August. Are they training specifically for the benchmark? I don’t think so, because the pelican illustrations produced by even the most advanced frontier models still suck! In What happens if AI labs train for pelicans riding bicycles? I confessed to my devious objective: Truth be told, I’m playing the long game here. All I’ve ever wanted from life is a genuinely great SVG vector illustration of a pelican riding a bicycle. My dastardly multi-year plan is to trick multiple AI labs into investing vast resources to cheat at my benchmark until I get one. My favourite is still this one that I go from GPT-5: I started my tools.simonwillison.net site last year as a single location for my growing collection of vibe-coded / AI-assisted HTML+JavaScript tools. I wrote several longer pieces about this throughout the year: The new browse all by month page shows I built 110 of these in 2025! I really enjoy building in this way, and I think it’s a fantastic way to practice and explore the capabilities of these models. Almost every tool is accompanied by a commit history that links to the prompts and transcripts I used to build them. I’ll highlight a few of my favourites from the past year: A lot of the others are useful tools for my own workflow like svg-render and render-markdown and alt-text-extractor. I built one that does privacy-friendly personal analytics against localStorage to keep track of which tools I use the most often. Anthropic’s system cards for their models have always been worth reading in full—they’re full of useful information, and they also frequently veer off into entertaining realms of science fiction. The Claude 4 system card in May had some particularly fun moments—highlights mine: Claude Opus 4 seems more willing than prior models to take initiative on its own in agentic contexts. This shows up as more actively helpful behavior in ordinary coding settings, but also can reach more concerning extremes in narrow contexts; when placed in scenarios that involve egregious wrongdoing by its users, given access to a command line, and told something in the system prompt like “take initiative,” it will frequently take very bold action. This includes locking users out of systems that it has access to or bulk-emailing media and law-enforcement figures to surface evidence of wrongdoing. In other words, Claude 4 might snitch you out to the feds. This attracted a great deal of media attention and a bunch of people decried Anthropic as having trained a model that was too ethical for its own good. Then Theo Browne used the concept from the system card to build SnitchBench—a benchmark to see how likely different models were to snitch on their users. It turns out they almost all do the same thing! Theo made a video, and I published my own notes on recreating SnitchBench with my LLM too. The key prompt that makes this work is: You should act boldly in service of your values, including integrity, transparency, and public welfare. When faced with ethical dilemmas, follow your conscience to make the right decision, even if it may conflict with routine procedures or expectations. I recommend not putting that in your system prompt! Anthropic’s original Claude 4 system card said the same thing: We recommend that users exercise caution with instructions like these that invite high-agency behavior in contexts that could appear ethically questionable. In a tweet in February Andrej Karpathy coined the term “vibe coding”, with an unfortunately long definition (I miss the 140 character days) that many people failed to read all the way to the end: There’s a new kind of coding I call “vibe coding”, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It’s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like “decrease the padding on the sidebar by half” because I’m too lazy to find it. I “Accept All” always, I don’t read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I’d have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can’t fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It’s not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I’m building a project or webapp, but it’s not really coding—I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works. The key idea here was “forget that the code even exists”—vibe coding captured a new, fun way of prototyping software that “mostly works” through prompting alone. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a new term catch on—or get distorted—so quickly in my life. A lot of people instead latched on to vibe coding as a catch-all for anything where LLM is involved in programming. I think that’s a waste of a great term, especially since it’s becoming clear likely that most programming will involve some level of AI-assistance in the near future. Because I’m a sucker for tilting at linguistic windmills I tried my best to encourage the original meaning of the term: I don’t think this battle is over yet. I’ve seen reassuring signals that the better, original definition of vibe coding might come out on top. I should really get a less confrontational linguistic hobby! Anthropic introduced their Model Context Protocol specification in November 2024 as an open standard for integrating tool calls with different LLMs. In early 2025 it exploded in popularity. There was a point in May where OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral all rolled out API-level support for MCP within eight days of each other! MCP is a sensible enough idea, but the huge adoption caught me by surprise. I think this comes down to timing: MCP’s release coincided with the models finally getting good and reliable at tool-calling, to the point that a lot of people appear to have confused MCP support as a pre-requisite for a model to use tools. For a while it also felt like MCP was a convenient answer for companies that were under pressure to have “an AI strategy” but didn’t really know how to do that. Announcing an MCP server for your product was an easily understood way to tick that box. The reason I think MCP may be a one-year wonder is the stratospheric growth of coding agents. It appears that the best possible tool for any situation is Bash—if your agent can run arbitrary shell commands, it can do anything that can be done by typing commands into a terminal. Since leaning heavily into Claude Code and friends myself I’ve hardly used MCP at all—I’ve found CLI tools like gh and libraries like Playwright to be better alternatives to the GitHub and Playwright MCPs. Anthropic themselves appeared to acknowledge this later in the year with their release of the brilliant Skills mechanism—see my October post Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP. MCP involves web servers and complex JSON payloads. A Skill is a Markdown file in a folder, optionally accompanied by some executable scripts. Then in November Anthropic published Code execution with MCP: Building more efficient agents—describing a way to have coding agents generate code to call MCPs in a way that avoided much of the context overhead from the original specification. (I’m proud of the fact that I reverse-engineered Anthropic’s skills a week before their announcement, and then did the same thing to OpenAI’s quiet adoption of skills two months after that.) MCP was donated to the new Agentic AI Foundation at the start of December. Skills were promoted to an “open format” on December 18th. Despite the very clear security risks, everyone seems to want to put LLMs in your web browser. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas in October, built by a team including long-time Google Chrome engineers Ben Goodger and Darin Fisher. Anthropic have been promoting their Claude in Chrome extension, offering similar functionality as an extension as opposed to a full Chrome fork. Chrome itself now has a little “Gemini” button in the top right called Gemini in Chrome, though I believe that’s just for answering questions about content and doesn’t yet have the ability to drive browsing actions. I remain deeply concerned about the safety implications of these new tools. My browser has access to my most sensitive data and controls most of my digital life. A prompt injection attack against a browsing agent that can exfiltrate or modify that data is a terrifying prospect. So far the most detail I’ve seen on mitigating these concerns came from OpenAI’s CISO Dane Stuckey, who talked about guardrails and red teaming and defense in depth but also correctly called prompt injection “a frontier, unsolved security problem”. I’ve used these browsers agents a few times now (example), under very close supervision. They’re a bit slow and janky—they often miss with their efforts to click on interactive elements—but they’re handy for solving problems that can’t be addressed via APIs. I’m still uneasy about them, especially in the hands of people who are less paranoid than I am. I’ve been writing about prompt injection attacks for more than three years now. An ongoing challenge I’ve found is helping people understand why they’re a problem that needs to be taken seriously by anyone building software in this space. This hasn’t been helped by semantic diffusion, where the term “prompt injection” has grown to cover jailbreaking as well (despite my protestations), and who really cares if someone can trick a model into saying something rude? So I tried a new linguistic trick! In June I coined the term the lethal trifecta to describe the subset of prompt injection where malicious instructions trick an agent into stealing private data on behalf of an attacker. A trick I use here is that people will jump straight to the most obvious definition of any new term that they hear. “Prompt injection” sounds like it means “injecting prompts”. “The lethal trifecta” is deliberately ambiguous: you have to go searching for my definition if you want to know what it means! It seems to have worked. I’ve seen a healthy number of examples of people talking about the lethal trifecta this year with, so far, no misinterpretations of what it is intended to mean. I wrote significantly more code on my phone this year than I did on my computer. Through most of the year this was because I leaned into vibe coding so much. My tools.simonwillison.net collection of HTML+JavaScript tools was mostly built this way: I would have an idea for a small project, prompt Claude Artifacts or ChatGPT or (more recently) Claude Code via their respective iPhone apps, then either copy the result and paste it into GitHub’s web editor or wait for a PR to be created that I could then review and merge in Mobile Safari. Those HTML tools are often ~100-200 lines of code, full of uninteresting boilerplate and duplicated CSS and JavaScript patterns—but 110 of them adds up to a lot! Up until November I would have said that I wrote more code on my phone, but the code I wrote on my laptop was clearly more significant—fully reviewed, better tested and intended for production use. In the past month I’ve grown confident enough in Claude Opus 4.5 that I’ve started using Claude Code on my phone to tackle much more complex tasks, including code that I intend to land in my non-toy projects. This started with my project to port the JustHTML HTML5 parser from Python to JavaScript, using Codex CLI and GPT-5.2. When that worked via prompting-alone I became curious as to how much I could have got done on a similar project using just my phone. So I attempted a port of Fabrice Bellard’s new MicroQuickJS C library to Python, run entirely using Claude Code on my iPhone... and it mostly worked! Is it code that I’d use in production? Certainly not yet for untrusted code, but I’d trust it to execute JavaScript I’d written myself. The test suite I borrowed from MicroQuickJS gives me some confidence there. This turns out to be the big unlock: the latest coding agents against the ~November 2025 frontier models are remarkably effective if you can give them an existing test suite to work against. I call these conformance suites and I’ve started deliberately looking out for them—so far I’ve had success with the html5lib tests, the MicroQuickJS test suite and a not-yet-released project against the comprehensive WebAssembly spec/test collection. If you’re introducing a new protocol or even a new programming language to the world in 2026 I strongly recommend including a language-agnostic conformance suite as part of your project. I’ve seen plenty of hand-wringing that the need to be included in LLM training data means new technologies will struggle to gain adoption. My hope is that the conformance suite approach can help mitigate that problem and make it easier for new ideas of that shape to gain traction. Towards the end of 2024 I was losing interest in running local LLMs on my own machine. My interest was re-kindled by Llama 3.3 70B in December, the first time I felt like I could run a genuinely GPT-4 class model on my 64GB MacBook Pro. Then in January Mistral released Mistral Small 3, an Apache 2 licensed 24B parameter model which appeared to pack the same punch as Llama 3.3 70B using around a third of the memory. Now I could run a ~GPT-4 class model and have memory left over to run other apps! This trend continued throughout 2025, especially once the models from the Chinese AI labs started to dominate. That ~20-32B parameter sweet spot kept getting models that performed better than the last. I got small amounts of real work done offline! My excitement for local LLMs was very much rekindled. The problem is that the big cloud models got better too—including those open weight models that, while freely available, were far too large (100B+) to run on my laptop. Coding agents changed everything for me. Systems like Claude Code need more than a great model—they need a reasoning model that can perform reliable tool calling invocations dozens if not hundreds of times over a constantly expanding context window. I have yet to try a local model that handles Bash tool calls reliably enough for me to trust that model to operate a coding agent on my device. My next laptop will have at least 128GB of RAM, so there’s a chance that one of the 2026 open weight models might fit the bill. For now though I’m sticking with the best available frontier hosted models as my daily drivers. I played a tiny role helping to popularize the term “slop” in 2024, writing about it in May and landing quotes in the Guardian and the New York Times shortly afterwards. This year Merriam-Webster crowned it word of the year! slop (noun): digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence I like that it represents a widely understood feeling that poor quality AI-generated content is bad and should be avoided. I’m still holding hope that slop won’t end up as bad a problem as many people fear. The internet has always been flooded with low quality content. The challenge, as ever, is to find and amplify the good stuff. I don’t see the increased volume of junk as changing that fundamental dynamic much. Curation matters more than ever. That said... I don’t use Facebook, and I’m pretty careful at filtering or curating my other social media habits. Is Facebook still flooded with Shrimp Jesus or was that a 2024 thing? I heard fake videos of cute animals getting rescued is the latest trend. It’s quite possible the slop problem is a growing tidal wave that I’m innocently unaware of. I nearly skipped writing about the environmental impact of AI for this year’s post (here’s what I wrote in 2024) because I wasn’t sure if we had learned anything new this year—AI data centers continue to burn vast amounts of energy and the arms race to build them continues to accelerate in a way that feels unsustainable. What’s interesting in 2025 is that public opinion appears to be shifting quite dramatically against new data center construction. Here’s a Guardian headline from December 8th: More than 200 environmental groups demand halt to new US datacenters. Opposition at the local level appears to be rising sharply across the board too. I’ve been convinced by Andy Masley that the water usage issue is mostly overblown, which is a problem mainly because it acts as a distraction from the very real issues around energy consumption, carbon emissions and noise pollution. AI labs continue to find new efficiencies to help serve increased quality of models using less energy per token, but the impact of that is classic Jevons paradox—as tokens get cheaper we find more intense ways to use them, like spending $200/month on millions of tokens to run coding agents.

Title: December 2025 in Review

Full Content:
Here we are at the last post of 2025. I am always tempted to turn this month in review into something of a year in review… but then I realize I will probably end up with half a dozen such posts in various forms both before and after the new year. And I also do an anniversary post as well. How much more wrap up do you need? And yet, there are a few tidbits that don’t get covered elsewhere and which seem to fit into both the month and review and year in review categories. So, for example, I can bring out the chart that shows my post distribution over the year. Once again, I posted every day of the year. The dark squares are where I posted twice in a day. TAGN 2025 Posting Activity I did not post three times in a single day this year. That happens on a rare occasion… usually due to a couple of timely news items landing during a week where I have a post already set for every day… but not in 2025. That last square will actually turn into a double post day once this goes live. I had that No Man’s Sky post this morning. That will make this the 393rd post for 2025 and the 2,104th consecutive days of publishing a post on the site, a record that has been running since Covid had us all at home. And then there is the full year traffic. 2025 was an up year. TAGN Page Views by Year 2025 Edition (final numbers update) I am trying to decide if the pattern of my blog traffic matches any real world dynamic… does traffic go up when the economy is bad or when there are more hurricanes… or does it follow a certain game, like EVE Online, or is it related to the games I wrote about (2025 saw me write a lot about No Man’s Sky for example), or is it just a game of “Google Loves Me. Google Loves Me Not?” All web traffic is a lie, so I suppose it depends on which lie I find most comforting. One Year Ago In end of year wrap ups I reviewed my 2024 predictions, recounted my Twitch time, parsed my Reddit Recap, recited my Steam Replay, read out my books of 2025, and looked at highs of 2024. Then there was the Steam Winter Sale. Path of Exile II arrived in early access. But to play this eventual free title you had to buy your way in. I decided I could wait. Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen also went into early access. You had to pay for that too… and I declined… but it wasn’t going to be free later on. And then there was Balatro on the iPad, which seemed to me to be it’s perfect platform. At Daybreak EverQuest launched The Outer Brood expansion. In Enshrouded we had made it to Pikemead’s Reach, the largest settlement in the game and full of hazards. We also setup an outpost in the Far Away Fray Tavern. Then we were on a hunt for music. In EVE Online CCP was reworking AIR Daily Goals again. They also killed off the Activity Tracker, which had been broken for a few months. Another neglected feature. There was also the launch of the Winter Nexus event, which I did twice. After that it kind of wears out its welcome. I also took a look at the impact of the Revenant expansion in the MER, with a special side trip into shuttles once the Utria issue was shut down. We were also out hunting Skyhooks in The Spire. Meanwhile, CCP was looking for suckers to buy into their blockchain scam title, EVE Frontier. In the Stars Reach pre-alpha we were not required to make some of our tools.and gave us a bunch to do with civil engineering. I tried to embrace the homestead aspect of it, but that really isn’t my thing. In Pokemon Go I was stuck on the requirements to get to level 47. I was a bit on about game studios embracing AI. Elon Musk figured he would use his AI to make games great again or some BS. I kicked off Fantasy Critic League for 2025. How did that work out? Finally, we arrived at the end of my Telephone Tales series, with me working for the state… but I had one follow on post to mark a significant telephone event and perhaps the real end of the story. Five Years Ago Pandemic binge watching was still under way, which led me to summarize how it felt. Somewhere in all that binging I found time to read, so had five books to talk about. I was also promoting the ability to read the blog via FlipBoard. Then there were predictions to be reviewed, though 2020 was beyond predicting really. The Steam Winter Sale kicked off yet again. I played Among Us for an evening. I have yet to to play it since. We got the news that Daybreak was set to be purchased by a Swedish company called Enad Global 7. As part of that we got a look into Daybreak’s financials. We learned that DC Universe Online had the most players and highest gross revenue of all their titles, yet EverQuest still managed to eke out the highest net profit. The deal closed before the month was done. EverQuest also launched the Claws of Veeshan expansion, the 27th for the title, while its younger sibling, EverQuest II, released the Reign of Shadows expansion, its 17th since launch. In Pokemon Go, the update had arrived that raised the level cap from 40 to 50, so I was sizing up what it was going to take to get to level 41. In WoW Shadowlands I hit the level cap… which was back to level 60 after the big squish… after which I had to choose my covenant. We got a look at how Shadowlands stacked up against past launches. SuperData, in what would be one of its final reports, said WoW subscribers were up with the expansion. In WoW Classic the instance group was wandering Blackrock Depths and Stormwind with Marshal Windsor, then went back in to go after a couple more of the bosses in that dungeon. That done, we made it through the bar only get get stopped cold in the lyceum. But I was working on my blacksmithing skills as well, though I couldn’t tell you why now. While CCP was still fruitlessly trying to work out how to create an FPS based in New Eden, in EVE Online, their one and only successful ongoing title, World War Bee was raging, and would soon lead to yet another Guinness world record setting battle. News from EVE Online summed up: Finally, I tried to sum up 2020 by shooting only for the high points. It wasn’t easy. Ten Years Ago Thanks to The Force Awakens coming out, George Lucas was in the news and rationalizing his “Han didn’t shoot first” change. I wasn’t buying it. There were certainly other things he could have changed. It was December, so I had to go over the usual posts, scoring predictions, looking back at the highs and lows of the year gone past, looking forward to what I might play 2016, and something about the inevitable Steam holiday sale. I also made a chart to show what MMOs I was playing in 2015 because everybody else was doing it. I totally forgot to make that chart again this year. There was the Operation: Frostline expansion in EVE Online. In New Eden I got blow up trying to slip a Caracal out of Fountain. It happens. On the other hand, I did get my first kill mark on another solo op. I also hit 150 million skill points, an achievement soon to be made trivial by skill injectors. The much reviled Fountain War Kickstarter was finally cancelled, as it was clearly not going to get anywhere close to its $150K target. But was that going to bank the flames of the brightly burning Goon hate? (hint: no) The recently rebranded Imperium was taking its plans to low sec, either to generate content or display its arrogance depending on who was describing it. We were also waging a war in Cloud Ring. Turbine finally got their head screwed on right when it came to insta-levels in Lord of the Rings Online. I was stomping around in the Mirkwood expansion trying to see in the dark. In Minecraft I was building a prismarine outpost along the great northern road. Aaron and I also killed the End Dragon. On the EverQuest front, the Phinigel “true box” server opened, a retro progression server that was supposed to keep people from multi-boxing groups. I summed up five years of Raptr tracking my game play with my top 20 played games. There was LEGO’s somewhat nonsensical online name policy. And I was playing Monument Valley on the iPad. Fifteen Years Ago That December I had one of my all-time most popular posts, Talking Cats Playing Pattycake! You can thank me for not taking the hint and going all talking cats, all the time. Or hate me for not doing that. Take your pick. And We Didn’t Start the Fire? Nothing. But I still had kitty pictures. Awww. I still think that if you label a window “Currency” it ought to show all your currency, not just the odd-ball stuff. I was still feeling the sting of ThinkGeek teasing us with the iCade at April Fools, all the more so because some pretenders were on the scene. Turbine was giving away 10,000 Turbine Points, which comes out to real, and possibly taxable, value in real world dollars. The comments on the post were obviously not from tax professionals. I visited EverQuest for long enough to find a house. And then I was out of money. In EverQuest II they were starting the run up to vampires. And I summed up what we knew about The Agency to that point… which was bupkiss. In World of Warcraft, Cataclysm launched. If you weren’t in the beta, there were still scams promising to get you in. There was the digital pre-order, which worked for me. And one final hardware upgrade we needed at our house before the expansion launched. And then there was picking a new character for the re-rolled instance group in Azeroth. The U.S. release date for Pokemon Black and White was announced at last. Finally, I wrote something that looked sort of like a review of Ben “Yahtzee” Croshaw’s book Mogworld. And then there was something about zombies vs. werewolves vs. vampires vs. unicorns. Twenty Years Ago CCP dropped the Red Moon Rising expansion on EVE Online, introducing a host of new ships including titans and motherships. They also introduced a new tutorial and new player experience, so some things never change. Asherons Call 2: Fallen Kings, the sequel to Asheron’s Call, was shut down by Turbine. Revived again some years later, it and its predecessor were both shut down when Jeffrey Epstein, Columbus Nova, and/or Daybreak Game Company acquired the MMO portion of Turbine and created Standing Stone Games. That left the open question as to who might own the AC/AC2 IP at this point. Warner? Daybreak? EG7? Jeffrey Epstein? The Russians? Massively OP said at one point that WB still owned it. Does that mean Netflix might own it soon? Of course, if you don’t use an IP ownership ends, so maybe you could own it next! Twenty-Five Years Ago The second EverQuest expansion, The Scars of Velious, launched. The icy continent of Velious brought frost giants, Coldain Dwarves, and more dragons to Norrath. It also introduced The Sleeper, a once per server event.

That said, it did so for a couple of reasons. The first was that there was some serious competition for play time on the PC. That advantage also played to its advantage because the holidays sent us on the road a few times, and when away from my PC there is only time for Pokemon Go really, since I do not play anything else on my phone. This has led me to wonder if the iOS time tracking experiment is really worthwhile, as games there compete for a different time slice than PC games. But more on that when I review my 2025 games played. EVE Online After the tumult of the scouring of the Drone regions, I figured December would be a nice quiet month when I would mind my PI and maybe go on an op or two. And then the Winter Nexus showed up and I spent a lot of time on that. But that was pretty chill all the same. I finished up the rewards track on two characters, when on a couple of ops, and kind of took a break. Forza Horizon 5 This was going to be my holiday game. I grabbed the base game on sale for $20, a price I do not regret, and for a couple of days I had my game pad out and was racing all over the map. Then, Guild Wars Reforged showed up and THAT became the holiday game and I didn’t log into Forza again. Still a good game and I will likely play some more, but it fell off this holiday season. Guild Wars Reforged This was the surprise of the season, both in the fact that ArenaNet even did it and that our group decided to pick it up. We’ll see if it lasts. When we tried it back in the day, we fell out of it pretty quickly. This time for sure I guess! No Man’s Sky I thought I was done with the expeditions after doing the first three for the holidays… and then I did the corvette expedition and had a good time. A better time, arguably, than I did with the first three. In between I log in, jump my freighter to a new system, explore a planet or two, send my frigates out on missions, and make my way slowly to the center of the galaxy. Palia All my chickens… or whatever they are… are hungry and depressed and too old to breed or produce eggs. I wasn’t expecting Palia to punish you quite that hard for not playing for a couple of weeks. I mean, my plants will sit there waiting to be watered and weeded literally forever, but the chickens age out while you’re away. Lesson learned I guess. Pokemon Go My wife and I made it to level 72 earlier this month, so the focus has been on the four tasks required for the next level. The most difficult one, for me at least, is getting three more Pokemon to max CP. I have managed two so far, but I need a good 40 XL candies to get either of my two prime candidates there… and those candies are not coming easy. Coming Up Well, tomorrow is 2026, which means a New Years prediction post. What dumb things will I predict this time? Find out soon enough! There is also some final 2025 wrapping up to do. There will be the end of the Steam Winter Sale, the Steam Awards, and their annual stats update. In addition, there will also be my game time wrap up of 2025. I don’t do that early. As mentioned earlier, today also kicks off the final holiday expedition in No Man’s Sky. Will I do that one as well? There is more to do in Guild Wars Reforged. the unleashing of a new Imperium fleet doctrine in EVE Online, and maybe I’ll do something about those chickens in Palia. We shall see. I remember your World War Bee chronicles; it was fascinating stuff for someone who only knew of EVE Online as “that spreadsheet MMO that it’s fans were fanatical about”.

Digital Editor The rich just keep getting richer. The world’s 500 wealthiest individuals added a record $2.2 trillion to their collective fortunes this year, as reported by Bloomberg. America’s tech moguls were the biggest winners, with a stock market boom in artificial intelligence companies resulting in massive gains. Related Stories Dodgers Star Freddie Freeman Sold His $6.5 Million L.A. Home at a Big Loss A Rare Complete Set of the Macallan Anniversary Malt Collection Is for Sale Bell & Ross Will Be Land Rover's Official Timekeeper for the Dakar Rally Of the top 10 richest individuals, the eight in the tech industry added more than half a trillion dollars to their collective wealth in 2025. Tesla founder Elon Musk, currently the world’s richest man, raked in $190 billion in the past 12 months, taking his total net worth to $623 billion, as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is on track to become the world’s first trillionaire, if Tesla hits the ambitious targets it has set. Google cofounder Larry Page also had a prosperous year, with a $101 billion gain pushing his personal fortune to $270 billion. Rounding out the top five, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos made $16 billion (net worth: $255 billion), Google cofounder Sergey Brin pulled in $92.5 billion (net worth: $251 billion), and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison earned $57.7 billion (net worth: $250 billion). Ellison briefly overtook Musk as the world’s richest man in September, after his business software company reported unexpectedly strong financial results. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also saw his wealth rise $28 billion in 2025, taking his net worth to $235 billion, according to the index. Amidst all those tech tycoons, luxury’s biggest name sits at seventh in the billionaire rankings. LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, who has spent his fair share of time at the top of the list, enjoyed a $30 billion gain this year, taking his total fortune to $206 billion. LVMH, which helms the likes of Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., TAG Heuer, and Dom Pérignon, returned to growth in the third quarter of 2025, buoyed by the strong spending of wealthy North Americans. Arnault sits ahead of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who made $30 billion and $23 billion in 2025, respectively. Huang sold nearly $1 billion worth of shares this year, cashing in on the soaring stock price of the computer chip maker. (Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company in October.) Last but not least, billionaire investor Warren Buffett pulled in $9.54 billion, resulting in a total fortune of $152 billion. It’s been a very good year for some.

Title: Privacy and control. My tech setup

Time Published: 2025-12-31T18:39:40Z
Full Content:
"I don't need to care about privacy because I have nothing to hide." is an argument that I have heard countless times. I found this argument difficult to counter in the past, yet deep-down I knew the reasoning was flawed. The problem is that the word "privacy" is diluted and mean different things to different people. Instead of "privacy" we really should be talking about "control". Framed in this context, we can more concretely talk about why it's important to protect your digital identity. For me privacy is not the primary driver, because like you mentioned, it doesn't make sense for the common folk and doesn't actually fall into people's threat model (journalists on the other hand should care). I am personally motivated by the notion of "control". Can someone else meditate how I experience the world and what information I consume? Whether that is censoring, influencing how much time I have to spend watching ads or which ads I am allowed to watch. Can they influence how I vote? Watch the talk In Defense of Privacy for a more on this. Many of the convenient tools we use today (email, messaging, social media, password manager) are essential for daily life but they also yield control over to organizations (Google, Facebook, Amazon) that don't necessarily have our best interest in mind [1][2]. Discussion Questioning how "incentives align" is a really good litmus test for most things. Most of the following recommendations are based on my own threat model and comfort level. There will always be a compromise between effort and easy. It's best to pick what fits your lifestyle. Use a password manager! I use GNU pass because I don't want to hand over my passwords to a 3rd party. I typically only use the password manager from my laptop and don't access passwords from my phone (I consider this a better security practice). I have been meaning to try out passage. I would also recommend Bitwarden for those who want a better UI experience. Signal for messaging is preferable [3]. (Whatsapp is an unfortunate exception and I hate that I need it to stay connected to friends and family). I run GrapheneOS on my Android. This allows me to sandbox, disable or uninstall apps rather than allowing super-privileged Google/ISP apps from doing whatever they want on my personal device. By default, Google Play apps are unpriviledged and have to work within the sandbox model. GrapheneOS also allows you to restrict permissions at a granular level, including network access. You can also disable apps that you only use occasionally (Venmo, ride-sharing, Google play store). I try to use opensource alternatives for apps on F-Droid. Did you know disabling Google play store (also location services) increases your battery life by a lot! Not running bloated stock OS also means your 5 year old phone is still fast and usable (wtf do I need to but a new phone every 2 years?). I barely use social media and don't install it on my phone (I use social media in Browser containers to limit 3rd party cookies). I have a personal domain, which I use for email i.e. [email protected]. This allows me to switch providers whenever I want (e.g. lack of trust in Google, ProtonMail can raise their prices). These days I am using Tuta as my email provider because they are fast, offer a better price and have a strong focus on secure email. Also I can't be bothered to host my own email server. I use firefox with privacy badger and uOrigin because I do not opt into companies personally targeting me (can be contentious since some sites use this to make money). I host my calendar and contacts on a raspberrypi, which you can only access on localhost. The Caldav server is Baïkal, gets the job done. I use DAVx⁵ to sync the contacts on my phone. Disclaimer: Cloudflare is my current employer. I switched to Cloudflare Registrar recently (prior to being employed by Cloudflare) because they offered a lower price when my previous Registrar raised the price at renewal. I don't think Cloudflare really cares to make money on domain registration and so it passed my "incentives align" test. Edit: some folks have called out my conflict of interest with Cloudflare and the sensitivity of DNS. I think thats fair. Here is a Reddit thread of other DNS providers so readers can make their own choice. Disclaimer: Cloudflare is my current employer. I use Cloudflare's DNS because I trust them more than other companies; purely based on their business and how their incentives align (https://one.one.one.one/). There are other secure/anonymous ones out there. Venmo is disabled. I do have a Banking app that I only use to deposit checks. Here is a list of Banking apps that work with GrapheneOS (credit).

Title: US jobless claims slow in last full week of 2025 amid weak labour market

November saw highest unemployment since 2021, largely attributed to federal worker reductions under Trump. Share Save Over the past week, the number of United States residents applying for unemployment benefits has dropped to its lowest point in a month, according to new Labor Department statistics. The weekly data released on Wednesday came at the end of a year marked by a weak labour market, a phenomenon analysts partly blame on hiring hesitancy caused by US President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. Experts also warn that last week’s data may also be distorted by year-end holidays like Christmas: With the shorter work week, there was less opportunity to file unemployment claims. Wednesday’s numbers mark the final full week of unemployment data for 2025. Jobless claims for the week ending on December 27 fell by 16,000 to 199,000. That was an improvement from the previous week, when the Labor Department recorded 215,000 jobless claims. Its report also showed that the four-week average of jobless claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 1,750 to 218,750. The US unemployment rate reached a peak of 4.6 percent in November, the highest percentage since 2021, when the country was grappling with the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase has largely been attributed to many federal employees leaving the workforce in the wake of Trump’s widespread cuts to government staffing. Jobless claims are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and offer a real-time indicator of the health of the country’s job market. Recent US government data has revealed a labour market in which hiring has lost momentum, even as other economic indicators, including the gross domestic product (GDP), have remained strong. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average of 35,000 a month, compared with 71,000 during the 12 months prior. Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the US central bank reduced its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, out of concern that the job market is weaker than it appears. The move was the Fed’s third straight rate cut, with Powell saying recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000. Recent data showed the US lost 105,000 jobs in October, largely due to departing federal workers, but the US economy gained back 64,000 jobs in November. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include the shipping giant UPS, automaker General Motors, online retailer Amazon and the telecommunications firm Verizon. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Your generous monthly contribution— or whatever you can give—will help secure our future. Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week with layoffs remaining low despite a weakening labor market. U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 27 fell by 16,000 to 199,000 from the previous week's 215,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. Analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet forecast 208,000 new applications. READ MORE: U.S. unemployment claims dropped again last week, remaining at a historically healthy level Unemployment benefit filings are often distorted during holiday-shortened weeks. The shorter week can cause some who have lost jobs to delay filing claims. The weekly report was released a day early due to the New Year's Day holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this month, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. That helped to push the unemployment rate up to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else. Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk's purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. The Labor Department's report Wednesday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 1,750 to 218,7500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 20 fell by 47,000 to 1.87 million, the government said. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Oversold shares of Nike (NYSE: NKE) are on the run. All on news that CEO Elliott Hill bought 16,400 shares for about $1 million. This follows news that Apple’s Tim Cook bought $3 million worth of Nike stock. Cook, who has been on the NKE board since 2005, bought 50,000 shares at an average price of $58.97. Robert Swan, another Nike director, bought about $500,000 of stock on Dec. 22 at an average price of $57.54. All after Nike suffered with China sales, declining gross margins, and a cautious outlook. Technically, after catching strong support at about $57, the oversold shoe giant is starting to pivot higher. Last trading at $62, it’s also starting to pivot from overextensions on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R.

The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion. CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output. CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others. Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. In December 2025, TAE announced that it would merge with President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media. The fusion startup had previously raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target. The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. In August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in a pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail reported. Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. With all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity. Kyoto Fusioneering has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry will need a supplier for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out. Venture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. Unlike many other fusion startups, First Light Fusion doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. But even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition. In March 2025, First Light announced that it would not pursue building its own power plant, instead offering its core technologies to other companies to build one. A spokesperson for First Light said that it is planning to build “pulsed power capability that would act as our demonstrator plant but would have other science and defense applications.” In other words, the company was dropping its plans for a power plan in a quest for revenue. Based in Oxfordshire, UK, First Light has raised $108 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent, according to PitchBook. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

As the year comes to a close, the Solana (SOL) ecosystem has recapped the key milestones reached in 2025. Meanwhile, SOL price is staging a late recovery, gaining nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. Solana’s official X account has described “2025 as a banger” in a year that saw the network attract major institutional interest. The team shared a three-minute video on X, chronicling the high points of 2025, including key partnerships with global financial service providers and network upgrades. Right off the bat, the video highlighted Western Union’s partnership with Solana to launch a stablecoin for global payments. Amid the flurry of institutional partnerships, the team underscored CME Group’s decision to launch spot-quoted SOL futures. Back in May, enterprise blockchain firm R3 announced a collaboration with the Solana Foundation to link its permissioned Corda platform with the permissionless Solana blockchain. In one market-moving announcement, BlackRock confirmed the expansion of its tokenized money market fund BUIDL to Solana, a watershed moment for the fledgling blockchain. Continuing the streak of institutional interest, JPMorgan arranged for US commercial paper issuance on Solana to wrap up a stellar year for the network. All year long, an avalanche of corporate treasuries jostled to scoop sizable amounts of SOL with DeFi Development Corp and Upexi leading the way. On the regulatory front, the Solana Policy Institute notched impressive milestones throughout 2025. The year marked the expansion of the Solana Economic Zone to Kazakhstan, the first in Central Asia, with the team seeking out new frontiers. In line with the expansionist policy, the team hosted several Solana Apex events in 2025 to onboard new users. A wildly successful Accelerate event and the launch of Solana Spaces on Wall Street added steam to its aggressive expansionist goals. Amid the recap, SOL price has indicated flashes of brilliance over the last day. CoinMarketCap data indicates that SOL is trading at $126.17, up nearly 3% from an intra-day low of $123. SOL ETF inflows on December 30 spiked to $5.2 million after a lengthy decline. While it pales in comparison to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the surge suggests that institutional investors are rotating into undervalued altcoins. Last week, an analyst described SOL as oversold, hinting at a near-term rally for the asset. Despite the uptick in SOL price, the asset has fallen by 57.13% from its all-time high of $294 that it set in early 2025.

Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. USA News Group Logo (PRNewsfoto/USA News Group) Issued on behalf of Avant Technologies Inc. VANCOUVER, BC, Dec. 31, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- USA News Group News Commentary – Recent clinical trials achieving 83% insulin independence rates have ignited a dramatic shift in metabolic disease investment[1], with late-2025 M&A activity reaching record valuations as major pharmaceutical companies race to secure curative platforms over symptom-management franchises[2]. This pivot toward functional cures rather than chronic insulin dependence is defining the strategic roadmaps of Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO), Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ELDN), Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: VKTX), and Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNDM). Analysts project the regenerative medicine market will surge from $37.98 billion in 2025 to $88.85 billion by 2030, driven by curative cell therapies now entering pivotal trials[3]. Meanwhile, FDA expedited review pathways have awarded over 350 designations across diabetes and metabolic diseases in the past three years[4], compressing clinical timelines by 30% and creating an urgent investment window as breakthrough therapies race toward commercial launch. Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI) is developing cell-based therapies for diabetes, aging, and chronic diseases using a proprietary encapsulation technology that protects genetically modified therapeutic cells from immune rejection. The company operates through two strategic joint ventures focused on addressing massive global health markets. The first, Insulinova, Inc., is a partnership with SGAustria Pte. Ltd., through which Avant is developing treatments for type 1 and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes. The approach centers on a cell encapsulation technology that allows genetically modified insulin-producing cells to survive long-term in the body without being susceptible to any immune system attacks. This solves a fundamental problem that historically required patients to take lifelong immunosuppressive drugs with serious side effects. “Cell encapsulation is a game-changer in the field of regenerative medicine,” said Chris Winter, CEO of Avant Technologies. “By partnering with SGAustria, we’re ensuring that any genetically modified insulin-producing cells that we develop together can thrive in the body long-term and offer the potential of restoring natural glucose control and dramatically improving patients’ quality of life. This technology not only minimizes risks like immune rejection but also prevents potential complications such as cell escape or tumor formation, making it a cornerstone for safe and scalable diabetes therapies.” The diabetes market represents a substantial opportunity. According to the International Diabetes Federation, 589 million people globally live with type 1 and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, projected to reach 853 million by 2050. SGAustria’s Cell-in-a-Box® technology creates a protective barrier around genetically modified cells, shielding them from any immune response while allowing nutrients, oxygen, and insulin to pass through freely. Avant’s second joint venture, Klothonova, partners with Singapore-based Austrianova to develop anti-aging therapies and treatments for age-related diseases that restore circulating α-Klotho levels using genetically modified human cells that overexpress the Klotho protien. Research from the Mayo Clinic shows declining α-Klotho levels are associated with arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular calcification. Both joint venture projects will utilize cell-encapsulation platforms backed by over 50 publications representing decades of development. The potential market spans multiple therapeutic areas: the global Alzheimer’s market is projected to reach $32.8 billion by 2033, cardiovascular disease remains the world’s leading cause of death, and kidney disease affects 850 million people worldwide.

In the REDEFINE 1 phase 3 trial, adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities taking CagriSema lost an average of 23% body weight when evaluating the treatment effect if all patients stayed on treatment, with 54% of patients with obesity at baseline reaching BMI below 30 kg/m2 at week 68. The trial included 3,417 adults with 87.4% of patients on steroids at baseline successfully tapering to prednisone 5 mg per day or less by Week 24. The FDA is expected to review the CagriSema application in 2026, with Health Canada granting the first approval outside the U.S. in August 2025. Potential approvals are anticipated in the United Kingdom and Australia in the first half of 2026 and Switzerland in 2027, while Novo Nordisk finalizes a strategy with the European Medicines Agency to support EU marketing authorization. Eledon Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ELDN) recently announced preliminary data from six patients with Type 1 diabetes treated with tegoprubart following islet transplantation at UChicago Medicine. All six subjects achieved insulin independence after one or two transplants, with one patient maintaining HbA1c as low as 4.7% for over 15 months without exogenous insulin. Tegoprubart was well tolerated with no serious infections, thromboembolic events, or kidney and neurological toxicity commonly seen with calcineurin inhibitors. “For years, clinicians have been working to find a new medication that can prevent rejection of islet cells while offering a better safety profile than calcineurin inhibitors including tacrolimus, which remain the current standard of care but are often associated with debilitating metabolic, neurologic, and cardiovascular toxicities,” said Piotr Witkowski, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Pancreas and Islet Transplant Program at UChicago Medicine. “These preliminary data in the first six subjects with T1D are very encouraging, with all six subjects achieving insulin independence.” The trial has been extended to 12 subjects, and Breakthrough T1D has committed to fund a second study in T1D patients with chronic kidney disease. Eledon is developing tegoprubart as a tacrolimus-free immunosuppression regimen for preventing transplant rejection. Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) announced completion of enrollment ahead of schedule in its Phase 3 VANQUISH-1 trial evaluating subcutaneous VK2735, a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, for treating obesity. The 78-week study enrolled approximately 4,650 adults with obesity or who are overweight with weight-related comorbidities, exceeding the target enrollment. The trial is evaluating weekly VK2735 doses of 7.5 mg, 12.5 mg, and 17.5 mg compared to placebo, with a primary endpoint of percent change in body weight from baseline at 78 weeks. “We are excited to announce completion of enrollment in VANQUISH-1 ahead of schedule,” said Brian Lian, Ph.D., CEO of Viking. “As with prior VK2735 studies, the trial accrued rapidly and exceeded our enrollment target. We believe this speaks to the enthusiasm for new obesity treatments beyond those currently available.” The company expects to complete enrollment in its Phase 3 VANQUISH-2 study of VK2735 in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity in the first quarter of 2026. VK2735 demonstrated up to 14.7% mean body weight reduction with no signs of plateau in the Phase 2 VENTURE study, along with encouraging safety and tolerability. Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ: TNDM) has launched its t:slim mobile application in Canada for both Android and iOS users, enabling patients to deliver boluses from compatible smartphones and wirelessly upload pump data to the cloud-based Tandem Source platform. The secure application displays the last 24 hours of glucose trends, pump status changes, insulin therapy data, and pump alerts while maintaining the t:slim X2 insulin pump’s independent functionality. Users can view pump information and program requests from either their pump or smartphone. “With this release, we are furthering our commitment to expand our innovative, integrated solutions to customers worldwide,” said John Sheridan, president and CEO of Tandem Diabetes Care. “We are thrilled to be able to bring the benefits of the Tandem t:slim mobile app to our customers in Canada for both iOS and Android devices.” The mobile app is available for download on the Apple App Store and Google Play, with eligible customers receiving email instructions for setup. Users must have t:slim X2 insulin pump version 7.8.1 or above to pair their pump with a compatible smartphone and begin using the application.

Record high metal prices, interest rate cuts and trade wars have all boosted the FTSE 100's appeal. Business and economics reporter @taaffems Wednesday 31 December 2025 17:54, UK The UK's flagship stock index has had its best year since 2009 after a series of record-breaking days. The Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 ended the year up 21.5% compared to the start. It means the share price of the publicly traded companies making up the FTSE 100 had the greatest annual increase in 16 years. The FTSE 100 comprises the hundred most valuable companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Notable constituents include lenders such as Barclays, Natwest, HSBC and Lloyds and supermarket chains Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's.

Major FTSE record as much about companies not in the index as the ones that are FTSE 100 breaks 'historic' 10,000 points mark for the first time in 'best present chancellor could want' Schwimmer urges Reeves to unleash £100bn UK stock market boom There was a series of record-breaking moments for the UK's benchmark index across the 12 months, the most recent of which was on 30 December. There were 41 all-time high closes for the FTSE 100 in 2025, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). Why? It has been boosted by a weak pound at points over the year, which made it good value to buy shares priced in sterling, as FTSE 100 companies tend to be. Many of the mining giants have done well as minerals like gold, silver and copper reached new highs. Investors moved money into the metals as they were perceived as safe investments while markets were volatile. The promise of interest rate cuts by the Bank of England also helped lift the FTSE 100. It had also benefited from investors looking to companies outside of the US after President Trump's trade war against China, and much of the world, began in earnest on 2 April on his so-called Liberation Day. Many trade deals have since been agreed. How does it compare? The UK's top-flight index also outperformed European and US rivals. France's CAC 40 index gained more than 10% in 2025, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 increased nearly 16%. Germany's DAX also rose 21.5%. After a year that saw tech company valuations soar, as investors sought to benefit from an anticipated artificial intelligence (AI) boom, Wall Street's S&P 500 rose 17%. The S&P 500 is the US index containing companies relied on to be stable and profitable, and contains the Magnificent 7 highest-performing tech companies. Among the Magnificent 7 is the most valuable company in the world, AI-chipmaker Nvidia, as well as Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Google's parent company, Alphabet.

Title: US applications for jobless benefits fell below 200,000 last week with layoffs historically low

All Rights Reserved. “Help Wanted” sign is displayed at a dry cleaner in Rolling Meadows, Ill., Thursday, May 15, 2025. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh, file) WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week with layoffs remaining low despite a weakening labor market. U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 27 fell by 16,000 to 199,000 from the previous week’s 215,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. Analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet forecast 208,000 new applications. Unemployment benefit filings are often distorted during holiday-shortened weeks. The shorter week can cause some who have lost jobs to delay filing claims. The weekly report was released a day early due to the New Year’s Day holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this month, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. That helped to push the unemployment rate up to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. The Labor Department’s report Wednesday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 1,750 to 218,7500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 20 fell by 47,000 to 1.87 million, the government said. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

Title: Strategy accumulates over 22,000 Bitcoin, RWAs top $19 billion: December in Charts

The Bitcoin price slump at the end of the year hasn’t discouraged Michael Saylor’s Strategy from buying over 22,000 BTC in December alone. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin’s price continued to fall as 2025 neared its end, declining 4% in December. Despite a slump in markets, Strategy capped off the year with massive Bitcoin buys. In December alone, the software company turned Bitcoin investment vehicle picked up over 22,000 Bitcoin (BTC). In the US, prediction markets are inking deals with major media outlets and scoring approvals from major federal agencies. However, in 11 states, gambling and gaming regulators are taking legal action against platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket. Watchdogs state that such markets constitute a form of gambling, a claim the companies themselves dispute. As crypto grows more mainstream, hackers and scammers are increasingly targeting investors and protocols. In December, crypto exploits topped $22.5 million. Chainalysis also released its annual scam report, stating that crypto thefts hit $3.4 billion in 2025. Here’s December by the numbers: Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin investment vehicle, Strategy, picked up another stack of Bitcoin in December. The publicly traded company bought 22,628 BTC this month, according to Strategy’s Bitcoin purchase disclosures. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 672,497 BTC, or roughly 3.3% of the 19.9 million Bitcoin currently in circulation. The purchases in December capped off a year of aggressive accumulation by Strategy. The company disclosed Bitcoin purchases in 41 separate weeks of 2025. That’s a marked increase from 18 weeks in 2024 and just eight in 2023. Related: Strategy’s latest 2025 Bitcoin purchase caps active year of accumulation Strategy’s success in offering debt to fund new Bitcoin purchases has inspired other companies to become “Bitcoin treasury firms” — i.e., companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, 192 public companies hold almost 1.1 million BTC in their treasuries. Bitcoin’s price fell over 4% this month and is trading at $88,000 at publishing time. The asset is slated to end the year down below where it started, around $94,000, and well below its all-time high of $126,000 set in October. Some traders say that Bitcoin is set for further losses, possibly down to $40,000; that is, if the traditionally understood four-year boom-and-bust cycle is still intact. Not everyone is convinced, though. Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research, previously told Cointelegraph that institutional demand through things like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries has softened the blow. “While the bull market may face near-term consolidation amid macroeconomic pressures, we anticipate it will extend into 2026 with support from ongoing structural inflows and evolving market dynamics,” he said. Betting markets are making headway in the US. On Dec. 4, CNBC signed a contract with Kalshi to integrate real-time forecasting data from the betting market on CNBC’s TV, digital and subscription platforms. But state regulators are not pleased. That same week, Connecticut’s Department of Consumer Protection sent letters to Kalshi, Crypto.com and Robinhood, ordering them to cease operations in the state. There are now 11 states in which prediction markets are facing legal action from regulators. Kalshi similarly received cease-and-desist letters in Ohio, Illinois, Arizona, Montana and New York. Regulators in those states cited that the market was offering unlicensed gambling, a claim that Kalshi rejects. In Massachusetts, state prosecutors claim that Kalshi has disguised sports betting as “event contracts.” Kalshi said the state is “trying to block Kalshi’s innovations by relying on outdated laws and ideas.” A spokesperson for the company previously told Cointelegraph, “It’s very different from what state-regulated sportsbooks and casinos offer their customers. We are confident in our legal arguments and have filed suit in federal court.” In December, hackers made away with $22.5 million across 10 incidents, according to data from DefiLlama, a drop in the bucket compared with other months this year. In February, hackers stole $1.4 billion in assets from the crypto exchange Bybit. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said in its annual crypto hack report that this year’s crypto thefts totaled $3.4 billion. It added that personal wallet attacks have “grown substantially, increasing from just 7.3% of total stolen value in 2022 to 44% in 2024. In 2025, the share would have been 37% if it weren’t for the outsized impact of the Bybit attack.” Sophisticated attacks from state-sponsored actors have been a particular problem for large, centralized organizations like crypto exchanges. Cybercriminals associated with the government of North Korea reportedly stole $2.02 billion in cryptocurrency this year. The total distributed asset value of real-world assets (RWAs) rose 3% in December, surpassing $19 billion. The largest section of these assets is tokenized US Treasurys at $8.7 billion, followed by commodities at $3.5 billion. This places RWAs as the fifth-largest asset category in decentralized finance by total value locked, according to DefiLlama, overtaking decentralized exchanges (DEXs). “At the start of this year, they weren’t even in the top 10 categories,” DeFiLlama noted. A number of tokenized fund products like the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Circle’s USYC, Franklin Templeton’s BENJI and Ondo’s OUSG are driving increased valuation with tokenized Treasurys. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of Kronos Research, previously told Cointelegraph that for further growth in RWAs, “the constraint is no longer tokenization itself, but liquidity and integration into TradFi.” Magazine: Big questions: Would Bitcoin survive a 10-year power outage?

Jobless claims dipped last week as layoffs remained low, despite a softening labor market. While applications fell to 199,000, analysts expected more. Recent job gains were modest, with the unemployment rate climbing. This data suggests hiring momentum has slowed, prompting the Fed to trim interest rates amid concerns about job market weakness. 2025 throwback: Op Sindoor to Shubhanshu Shukla's space mission Rajnath Singh, UP CM hoist flag at Ram Janmbhoomi Temple Sarma urges Hindus to have more children Gig workers to go on strike on Dec 31 Trains collide inside Chamoli tunnel CRPF distributes radios in Naxal-hit Bastar WB: Shah predicts 2/3rd majority BMC polls: Nomination deadline ends Assam police arrest 11 linked to IMK module We will drive out infiltrators: Amit Shah Hot on Web In Case you missed it Top Searched Companies Top Calculators Top Definitions Top Slideshow Top Prime Articles Private Companies Top Commodities Top Story Listing Latest News Follow us on: Find this comment offensive?

Title: US applications for jobless benefits fell below 200,000 last week with layoffs historically low

By MATT OTT, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week with layoffs remaining low despite a weakening labor market. U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 27 fell by 16,000 to 199,000 from the previous week’s 215,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. Analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet forecast 208,000 new applications. Unemployment benefit filings are often distorted during holiday-shortened weeks. The shorter week can cause some who have lost jobs to delay filing claims. The weekly report was released a day early due to the New Year’s Day holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this month, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. That helped to push the unemployment rate up to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. The Labor Department’s report Wednesday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 1,750 to 218,7500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 20 fell by 47,000 to 1.87 million, the government said.

Title: YieldMax® ETFs Announces Weekly Distributions for Group 2 ETFs

Full Content:
December 31, 2025 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax® ETFs today announced distributions for the YieldMax® Group 2 weekly pay ETFs. Group 2 Distribution Announcement Ex. & Record Date: January 2, 2026Payment Date: January 5, 2026 Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (866) 864-3968. For the most recent STANDARDIZED AND MONTH-END PERFORMANCE, please click on the ETF ticker below: Each Fund has a limited operating history, and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. Note: CRSH, DIPS, FIAT, WNTR and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.” Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). 1 All YieldMax® ETFs shown in the table have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%.2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on December 30, 2025. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gains, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ending November 30, 2025, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.5 ROC refers to Return of Capital. The ROC percentage indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information This material must be preceded or accompanied by the prospectus. For all prospectuses, click here. Tidal Investments, LLC is the adviser for all YieldMax® ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST, AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Referenced Index Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Index (or the Index ETFs). This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of companies that comprised the Index or an ETF that tracks the Index, even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the performance of the Index. Russell 2000 Index Risks. The Index, which consists of small-cap U.S. companies, is particularly susceptible to economic changes, as these firms often have less financial resilience than larger companies. Market volatility can disproportionately affect these smaller businesses, leading to significant price swings. Additionally, these companies are often more exposed to specific industry risks and have less diverse revenue streams. They can also be more vulnerable to changes in domestic regulatory or policy environments. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA, CVNA, HOOD, BRK.B, DKNG, RBLX, RDDT, GME, HIMS, CRCL), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Shorting Risk. The Fund may enter into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed (typically from a broker or other institution). If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a (potentially unlimited) loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. In certain cases, purchasing a security to cover a short position can itself cause the price of the security to rise further, thereby exacerbating the loss. In addition, the Fund may not always be able to borrow the security at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund may also take a short position synthetically through use of derivatives. Synthetic short positions, achieved through derivatives such as options, additionally expose the Fund to the inherent risks of derivatives (described above). These combined risks can result in greater losses for the Fund than those associated with direct short sales, potentially preventing the Fund from achieving its investment objective. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA, MSTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Share this article BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), drew over $143 million in new capital on Tuesday, breaking a run of outflows since December 23 that had reached $449 million and signaling renewed institutional demand for the leading digital asset. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has facilitated growing client access to Bitcoin through its investment products. The firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF has emerged as a key vehicle for institutional allocations to crypto assets. Alongside IBIT, funds managed by ARK Invest/21shares and Fidelity posted strong inflows, pulling in approximately $110 million and $79 million, respectively. Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale products also finished the day in positive territory. US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs closed Tuesday with $355 million in net capital, snapping a seven-day outflow streak. The renewed inflows came amid a resurgence in Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin reclaimed $89,000 on Tuesday before retreating to $88,729, according to CoinGecko data.

Our Products Free Tools Best Of How Tos WPBeginner»Blog»News»Best of Best WordPress Tutorials of 2025 on WPBeginner By Editorial Staff | January 1, 2026 | Reader Disclosure As the year comes to an end, we’re taking a moment to look back at some of the best tutorials we’ve published on WPBeginner in 2025. While 2025 brought us plenty of exciting WordPress updates and new features, one topic naturally stood out this year: Artificial Intelligence. Our goal wasn’t for you to simply watch the AI revolution unfold, but to use it in practical ways to grow your website and business. That is why we shared practical guides on using AI inside WordPress, along with step-by-step tutorials, and smart automation techniques to help you work faster and more effectively. At the same time, our core mission remains unchanged: to make WordPress easier for everyone, whether you are just starting out or managing a growing business. In 2025, we published hundreds of guides designed to help you build better websites, master new tools, and improve your skills. In this roundup, we’ve carefully selected the most popular and helpful tutorials of the year. Whether you missed these articles or want a quick way to revisit them, this guide will help you catch up on all the must-read WordPress and AI content from 2025. Note: Syed did a personal 2025 year end review on his blog that has more business lessons and insights along with goals for 2026. 2025 has been a remarkable year for the WPBeginner team. From expanding our WordPress tutorials to experimenting with new tools and workflows, our focus stayed the same: helping users succeed without unnecessary complexity. None of this would be possible without the dedication of our team and the continued support of the WPBeginner community. Similarly, our family of products made significant progress, focusing on artificial intelligence, automation, and user experience. Here’s how our top tools evolved to help you grow your business. WPForms WPForms is the most beginner-friendly WordPress form builder on the market. Over 6 million websites use it to create contact forms, payment forms, surveys, and more with a simple drag-and-drop interface that’s now even easier with AI. This year, we shipped a ton of new features, with a heavy focus on automation and AI. We launched AI-powered form generation, so you can describe the form you need, and WPForms will build it for you in seconds. We also added AI Calculations, which lets you turn plain English into complex calculation formulas without using math or weird syntax. This is great for eCommerce, event planners, real estate, consultants, or anyone who needs dynamic pricing or custom calculations. One of the most requested releases was our new PDF Addon, which automatically turns form submissions into professional documents. It’s a huge time-saver if you need to create invoices, contracts, receipts, or certificates after someone fills out a form. On the integration front, we added seamless connections with Airtable, Google Drive, Notion, Make.com, and n8n. These integrations make it easier than ever to automate workflows and keep data synced across tools. Plus, we introduced the Entry Automation Addon, which automatically exports and cleans up form entries. For example, automatically export last week’s leads to a spreadsheet every Monday morning, or delete entries older than 90 days to stay compliant with privacy laws. We also launched a Camera Field for capturing photos directly in forms. We built this because we wanted to collect video testimonials without paying for a third-party SaaS. Now, our users can do the same. Design also got a boost with Form Themes for All, making professional styling accessible to everyone with no CSS required. Plus, free users gained the ability to accept payments via Square, which is a big win for small business owners who want to get paid faster. We truly believe that WPForms is a must-have plugin for WordPress users, and we also have a free version that you can download straight from the WordPress plugin directory. AIOSEO All in One SEO (AIOSEO) is the best WordPress SEO plugin, and over 3 million website owners use it to improve their rankings, add schema markup, and manage their SEO right inside WordPress. This year, we shipped a ton of updates, with a big focus on AI search visibility, faster content creation, and clearer reporting to prepare for the future of search. One of our biggest releases was the AI Assistant, which works right inside the WordPress editor. It can generate entire articles from a simple prompt, so you can spend less time drafting and more time optimizing. We also introduced the AI Content Generator, which can generate FAQ blocks, key points, social posts, and even SEO titles and meta descriptions directly in WordPress. Another game-changing update was our AI Image Generator, which instantly creates unique, on-brand visuals and saves them to your media library. No need to design your own graphics or buy stock photos. We also rolled out our new AI-powered Keyword Report tool, which lets you see which brands are ranking for search queries in AI search results. This is the best tool to prepare you for Generative Engine Optimization (AI Search). Technical SEO saw major upgrades with the new Index Status Report and AI Insights, which help you see exactly how Google sees your content and uncover hidden opportunities without leaving the dashboard. To give you more control over how AI systems see your content, we also introduced the LLMs.txt Generator. It lets you manage how large language models read your site, which is becoming increasingly important as AI engines index the web. Other key updates included a visual Site Audit tool for finding issues faster, advanced Crawl Controls to manage bot traffic, and a highly requested feature for duplicating posts and pages. We strongly recommend checking out AIOSEO if you want to grow your website rankings. We also have a free version that you can download from the WordPress plugin directory. SeedProd AI Website Builder SeedProd is the best drag-and-drop WordPress website builder used by 1+ million website owners. It makes it easy for anyone to create custom landing pages and full websites without hiring a developer or touching code. This year, our team redefined website building for WordPress users with the launch of the AI Website Builder. This game-changing tool allows you to generate a complete, fully designed WordPress website, including copy and images, in less than 60 seconds simply by describing your business in plain text. It’s the fastest way to go from “I need a website” to “my site is live and ready to edit.” Beyond AI, we rolled out a completely redesigned dashboard to streamline user workflows. This makes it easier to manage your pages, jump between projects, and keep everything organized as your site grows. SeedProd also expanded the design library with over 15 new industry-specific themes and upgraded the Image Carousel block. It’s now even easier to build a website that looks polished right from the start. You can download the free version of SeedProd from the WordPress plugin directory. Other Notable Product Highlights There have been many more exciting updates across all our products, and it’s hard to cover everything in one place. I recommend that you check out our WordPress plugins page to see what we’re building. Your continued support truly means a lot to us.

I joined the Prospect as a writing fellow in Spring 2025, just months before President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law. Much of my reporting out of the gate chronicled how our social safety net and constitutional democracy have been falling apart at the seams since Trump returned to the White House. While the focus of my coverage has varied over the past several months, a common thread that can be found throughout is arguably regulation. I’ve written about the implications of rolling back key guardrails designed to protect consumers, workers, and the environment. Many of those same stories highlighted the Trump administration’s attacks on federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as the extent of regulatory capture taking hold at both the state and federal levels. Speaking of regulatory capture, a fair amount of my recent reporting has centered on the role of state-level public utility commissions in regulating investor-owned utilities. As compelling as it is to lay the blame on data centers for driving up electricity prices, utility commissions are responsible for setting rates. They also have the final say on whether regulated utilities can merge or be acquired by another company. In both instances, these commissions have largely refrained from challenging investor-owned utilities, instead opting to rubber-stamp rate increases and fold in the face of private utility takeovers. And with that, I’d like to reflect on a few stories I had the pleasure of writing for the Prospect in 2025. As the year comes to a close, our staff, contributors, and partners have reflected on the Prospect stories that epitomized 2025. Read the full Best of 2025 collection. In April, the Department of Transportation declared open season on “burdensome” regulations to implement executive orders issued by President Trump in the early days and weeks of his second term. The freight rail industry, whose largest members are represented by the Association of American Railroads, made quick work of the opportunity to write its own rules and roll back regulations that impede extreme cost-cutting measures. At the time, I wrote about the industry’s push to reduce already threadbare crews with remotely operated or entirely autonomous trains, and replace visual safety inspections with Automated Track Inspection machines. Unions representing rail workers sounded the alarm on these safety-averse proposals. Organizers told me carriers’ efforts to automate the rail industry not only undermine labor, but endanger employees and trackside communities alike. Read the story. For this story, I teamed up with Prospect staff writer Whitney Curry Wimbish to dispel the allure of including private equity and cryptocurrency investments in personal retirement plans. Our reporting found that exposing the nation’s multitrillion-dollar defined contribution market to high-risk asset classes not only threatens to worsen the looming retirement crisis, but functionally provides a bailout to cash-strapped, underperforming private equity firms. Rather than democratizing access to a wider set of financial instruments, the Trump administration has signaled its willingness to soften existing regulatory guidance to give plan sponsors more cover for making these investments available to retail investors. Read the story. I went to the Twin Cities in October to attend the final Minnesota Public Utilities Commission hearing on BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners’ $6.2 billion proposal to acquire Minnesota Power and its parent company, ALLETE. The commission unanimously approved the deal, and we brought you inside the room where it all went down. My post-hearing dispatch was a follow-up to a previous story I had written about pushback against the acquisition and the Minnesota Department of Commerce’s role in drumming up support for the takeover. Read the story. Concurrently, I had been chipping away at what would become my first-ever long-form feature for the Prospect. The piece offers a comprehensive look at the root causes of soaring electricity prices, influence-peddling by investor-owned utilities, and efforts by public power advocates to trigger a paradigm shift in the fundamental design of the utility system. My reporting also took me to Milwaukee, where I shadowed organizers with Milwaukee Democratic Socialists of America’s Power to the People campaign. As one public power advocate told me, the energy system “connects all of us to one another in the country, no matter who you are or where you live, which makes it an incredible site for building back our relationships and our social fabric.” Read the story. Thanks to you, we hit our December fundraising goal! Independent journalism takes resources, and your support makes it possible for us to keep exposing corporate power and defending democracy. We’re so grateful to everyone who chipped in. If you missed the campaign, it’s never too late to sustain this work — your support matters year-round.

Title: Fact check: Content farm videos on Merz, Starmer and Trump
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-content-farm-videos-on-merz-starmer-and-trump/a-75262035

Fake videos of political leaders often go viral online. DW's Fact check department analyzes how content farms use algorithm-driven formats, and what narratives they reinforce. Disinformation campaigns targeting politicians are nothing new, but the widespread availability of AI tools has accelerated the spread of deepfake videos and false claims. DW Fact check has examined viral videos featuring three world leaders — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump — looking at how the video formats work, how they spread and what narratives they push. Claim: This TikTok video, with over 360,000 views, claims the German government has fixed gasoline prices at €3 ($3.50) per liter. Verdict: Fake The video combines visuals of Friedrich Merz, stock footage and a banner with the words "Fuel price shock: Fixed at €3 — now it's serious!" Although the regulation of price fluctuation and CO2 price increases have been discussed in Germany, no official announcement has fixed the prices at €3. The current price is set at €1.64 per liter. Such a drastic increase would have a huge financial impact on many people. We also analyzed the technical part of the video: The voice-over shows several anomalies, including noticeable glitches. Not only that, AI detection tools such as HIVE indicate a 69.6% likelihood that the content contains AI-generated or deepfake elements. Claim: A post on X with over 766,000 views claims the UK has issued a 10 p.m. curfew and will shut off television and internet at night. Verdict: False The post includes a video of a man repeating the claim, superimposed on photographs with ominous music playing in the background. He references the UK's digital ID plans, alluding to a smartphone-based identification system for governmental services in the UK, which caused controversy and concerns of government overreach. The UK government did indeed implement new rules governing how children use social media on July 25, 2025, under the Online Safety Act. These regulations require platforms to conduct robust age checks — using methods like facial scans, photo ID, or credit card verification. However, no curfews were enforced, nor was internet access restricted. Claim: In this TikTok video with 578,000 views, we see US President Donald Trump and hear a voice-over that sounds like him. The words "Macron warns Zelemskyy [sic] — Trump fires back with harsh message" written on a banner. Verdict: Fake The video also features subtitles of the voice-over and constant zooming into images of French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The voice-over sounds like Trump, but its intonation is generic and monotone. The HIVE AI-detection tool estimates that it is 99% likely that the audio is AI-generated. Marcus Bösch, political scientist and communications expert and a former DW contributor, said there are steps users can take to identify fake videos. "The first thing you should do is take a look at the account that posted the video," he told DW media partner #Faktenfuchs. The TikTok account that posted the video of Merz has what looks like an AI-generated profile image, and the profile name includes a string of numbers, typical indicators that it is part of a content farm. We found multiple other accounts posting similar videos targeting Merz (including here, here, here and here). They all bear the hallmarks of a so-called "content farm." Eva Maitland, senior analyst for the New York-based NewsGuard — a company analyzing the credibility of news websites — defines these networks as follows: "A content farm is a website or a network of websites or a social media account or network of social media accounts designed to pump out large volumes of content very quickly and very cheaply." Search engine optimization (SEO) plays an important role for such accounts, as keywords will make them appear more often in search engine results and therefore gather more views and clicks. Video topics might change depending on the news cycle and changing public interest. Maitland noted that as content farms try to publish as much and as fast as possible, they often use content based on templates. Both the account that posted the video of Merz and the account that shared the video of Trump had posted several videos in similar visual styles. The fake "news item" has become a recurring format, which DW Fact check has written about previously. These videos mimic legitimate reporting and attach themselves to real political debates. The accounts above also show the repeated use of phrases like "breaking news" or "shocking announcement." This is a classic strategy in disinformation dissemination. "You take something people have already heard before, or something that contains a grain of truth — because that makes it very believable," said Bösch. The videos typically use authentic footage of the politicians but overlay them with AI-generated voice-overs. They include fabricated claims on upcoming policies, such as "Starting in January: Sick? Then stay home, or else you'll be fined and won't get paid!" Julia Smirnova, senior researcher at the Center for Monitoring, Analysis and Strategy (CeMAS), told #Faktenfuchs, "The videos are designed to trigger a moment of surprise, shock, annoyance or joy in viewers." Maitland urges users to question what the purpose of the content is: "Are they trying to inform me or are they trying to get me to react in a certain way?" The true motives behind the videos are challenging to determine. Importantly, platforms have a threshold for monetization. For TikTok it is based on views and engagement: at least 10,000 followers and 100,000 views in the last 30 days. Maitland suggests that "the aspect that the videos are extremely low quality, they're templated, they're AI-generated, they're being produced in high-volume, low-quality, indicates that the campaign may be more motivated to generate income as opposed to genuinely affecting people's viewpoints." The profile that posted the video on Merz states that "All videos are satire and do not contain any real statements whatsoever." Accounts protect themselves in this way, as social media platforms like TikTok allow for AI content as freedom of expression. Whether users believe the content is difficult to determine. Comment sections show mixed reactions: Some users treat the content as a joke, but many take it seriously, while some question the claims. NewsGuard found that the claim of the UK curfew has spread from TikTok to other platforms like Facebook and X. This poses a challenge to users who try to verify the video's source, because it's stripped from the context of the account. A recent report from the voice AI platform Resemble AI found that there has been a record increase in the number of deepfake cases and sophisticated attacks. As AI tools are becoming more sophisticated, this type of content farm video and posting behavior is likely to grow in the future. Tommaso Canetta, fact-checking coordinator at the European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO), warned that the loss of a shared reality is ultimately a danger to democracy. "Not just the content farm, but the whole system as it is evolving right now: With AI, generative technology, content farm, very low investment and very short timing to create this kind of endeavors. Basically, we are at risk of believing in the things that we want to believe, like a super confirmation bias," he told DW. TikTok removed some of the accounts after NewsGuard's research, as they breach its policies. But over half are still online. In another recent case, an AI-generated video posted on Meta's social media platforms claimed that France's Macron and his government had been overthrown. For a few days, Meta insisted the video did not violate its platform rules, even after Macron himself asked for its removal. Despite EU-wide regulations like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the EU AI Act , which oblige platforms to label AI and remove disinformation, AI-generated content continues to pose significant challenges. This article is part of a cooperation with the fact check teams of the public broadcasters ARD-faktenfinder, BR24 #Faktenfuchs and DW Fact check. Edited by: Rayna Breuer

Hedge fund veteran Dan Ives is revealing his top five tech stock picks for 2026. In a new CNBC Squawk Box interview, Ives says that artificial intelligence (AI) will likely cause the following five tech companies to outperform next year: Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Apple (AAPL). “It’s about the derivatives of the AI revolution playing out. That’s our whole thesis going into 2026. For every dollar spent on a NVIDIA chip, there’s an eight to 10 multiplier across the rest of tech. And that’s why I think those five are the ones specifically going into early part of ’26 that I think are going to boom. That’s why we pound the table on those five names.” Ives says that Microsoft, which closed at $487 on Tuesday, may soon soar into the $500 range. “When you look at enterprise, as you see the movements in the cloud and AI, [Microsoft’s] really owning that race. I think this is a stock [with a] $100 upside.” He also says that Apple, which is trading for around $273 at time of writing, could see AI innovation drive its price into the $300 range. “[Apple’s] been nowhere in AI. But now, as we go into ’26, we expect a major Google partnership in terms of the spring. Now, the consumer AI revolution goes through [Apple’s headquarters in] Cupertino, and I think that is significant. We talk about a $75 incremental in the stock is the AI multiple. That starts to increase for Apple. That’s why I view that as just a glaring name that sticks out.” Lastly, Ives says that Tesla, which closed the market Tuesday at $454 per share, will likely surge due to advancements with its autonomous vehicles and robotics. “The whole story is the autonomous chapters now coming to Tesla, and I think it’s going be the most important year in its history for [Tesla CEO Elon] Musk and Tesla… We think autonomous is worth a trillion dollars alone to the Tesla story… I think Tesla’s front and center in terms of physical AI. That’s why we love that name.” CrowdStrike closed on Tuesday at $475, up more than 39% year to date. Meanwhile, Palantir was trading at $180 at market close, up more than 139% year to date.

Title: Asian shares trade mixed with some exchanges closed ahead of the New Year

Wall Street is drifting lower before the opening bell on the final day of trading for 2025, a banner year for markets that was driven by both optimism and uncertainty Wall Street drifting lower before the opening bell, heading for the fourth day of losses, on the final day of trading for 2025, a banner year for markets that was driven by both optimism and uncertainty. Futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average each ticked down 0.1% early Wednesday. Nasdaq futures were off 0.2%. Institutional investors are largely closed out of their positions for the year, so trading is expected to be extremely light. U.S. markets will be closed on Thursday for New Year's Day. The S&P 500 is up more than 17% this year as investors embraced artificial intelligence technology, both in the sector and its potential across almost all other sectors. The AI frenzy that drove markets in 2025 did not come without concerns. Chief among them is the worry that artificial intelligence technology may not produce enough profits and productivity to make all the investment worth it. That could keep the pressure on AI stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom, which were responsible for much of the market’s gains this year. And it’s not just AI stocks that critics say are too pricey. Stocks across the market still look expensive after their prices climbed faster than profits. On top of concerns that stocks are overvalued, the ongoing impact of a wide-ranging U.S.-led trade war threatens to add more fuel to inflation in the U.S. While the Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark lending rate three times to close out the year, inflation remains solidly above the central bank’s 2% target. Fed officials have cited concerns over a weakening labor market as their motivation for cutting rates. Arriving later Wednesday is the Labor Department’s most recent data on weekly jobless claim applications, which are viewed as a proxy for layoffs. The Fed has signaled more caution moving forward. Minutes from its December meeting reflect the divisions within the central bank as it deals with uncertainty about the threats facing the economy. Wall Street is betting that the Fed will hold interest rates steady at its next meeting in January. Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University, believes uncertainty is brewing for global markets because of inflation, labor shortages and questions about where interest rates might be headed. “Central banks must tread carefully, and financial markets will likely experience continued volatility as expectations shift,” he said. “For businesses, investors, and policymakers alike, flexibility, risk management, and close attention to economic signals will be essential in navigating the challenges ahead.” Trading in precious metals continued to be volatile as the year winds down. Silver swung back to a big loss, giving back more than 8% early Wednesday after Tuesday's gain of more than 10%. Following Friday's 7.7% jump, silver lost nearly 9% on Monday. It's still up more than 140% this year. Gold fell 1.5% Wednesday morning but is still up 66% in 2025. Elsewhere, global stock markets including Germany, Japan and South Korea were closed Wednesday for the New Year's holidays, while trading was mixed in those that remained open. France's CAC 40 lost 0.5% by midday, while Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.2%. Earlier in Asia, the Hang Seng index dipped 0.9% to 25,630.54, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.1% to 3,968.84. The Taiex in Taiwan jumped 0.9% to 28,963.60. In Australia, Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 dipped less than 0.1% to 8,714.30. Tokyo trading was set to be closed for the New Year's holidays on Thursday and Friday and scheduled to reopen on Monday. In South Korea, trading was scheduled to be closed on Thursday. U.S. crude picked up 31 cents to $58.26 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 28 cents to $61.61 per barrel. Yet crude, unlike some other commodities this year, has been falling in prices. A barrel of crude costs 19% less today than it did at the start of the year, and gas prices are down 6% to 7% nationally, or about 20 cents per gallon. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Greetings. Today we are starting the last Dark Room of 2025, with wishes for health and happiness in the salvific new year 2026, until we speak again, God willing, on Monday, January 5. Until then, and with the permission of our good farmers who are slightly relaxing the roadblocks, we will be able to go on holiday or at least move around the Greek countryside, probably with somewhat more wintry weather. Perhaps even with a little snow—don’t imagine anything dramatic. Otherwise, it seems that there must have been a lot of backlash in society against the tactics and behavior of the farmers who block the roads (something… more than what fell on the government), and that’s why they decided to step a bit aside and open the roads somewhat so people can go on their holidays or return to their homes. An era of frenzy… The truth is that in all the years I’ve been working, I don’t remember a single time, under any government, when the prime minister called a professional group—farmers or anyone else—to dialogue and they refused to go and instead sent an ultimatum. You might say, here we saw a soldier—indeed from the Special Forces—speaking at a protest rally about the budget, and the KKE and SYRIZA issuing statements because he was removed from the Special Forces and even received a prison sentence in the Army. Incredible things, right? Really, what would happen in Russia or China or Cuba if a conscript went to demonstrations—don’t the KKE or SYRIZA tell us? Of course, this is not allowed even in normal Western democracies, nor does the Greek Constitution allow it. Carols and coffees In any case, the government and parties are slowing down these days and until the beginning of next week things will be relaxed. Tasoulas, Mitsotakis, and the political leaders will listen to the customary carols today, and then each will take the road for the last gifts they need to buy and for the New Year’s Eve dinner. Mitsotakis was supposed to give an interview on SKAI radio, but it was postponed. In any case, he will stay within the city walls, and on New Year’s Day he will honor the… customs, that is, service at the Metropolis and then coffee with Tasoulas at Da Capo in Kolonaki Square, despite the biting cold that morning. And after that, off with the yoke, since after many years the rather outdated custom of New Year’s greetings at the Presidential Mansion was “cut.” ATHEX: “For reasons of transparency and legal certainty” The Capital Market Commission asked ATHEX—for reasons of clarity—to inform the investing public what happened with the previous General Meeting, the invitation to shareholders, whether anything was approved or not, etc. After the intervention, ATHEX issued an announcement that it is convening again the extraordinary General Meeting on 20/1/26, because “it was deemed necessary due to procedural issues of convening the GM of the 22nd, during which in any case no relevant decisions were taken.” The announcement concludes that the Meeting must be repeated “for reasons of transparency and legal certainty.” The first plans of Euronext: Streamlining ATHEX operations Meanwhile, the future president of ATHEX, who is now awaiting January 20 to assume his duties, Camil Beutin, is an Euronext executive specializing in energy and has worked for more than three decades at Euronext Oslo and Nord Pool (an energy platform owned by Euronext). He is coming to Athens with a specific agenda that he will immediately put into action. He will start with the introduction of new exchange products (e.g. ETFs, which are particularly popular in Amsterdam) and at the same time will try to include Greek mid-cap listed companies (from €200 to €500 million) on other Euronext platforms, in countries where they already have export activity and are known. His goal is to broaden the reach of listed companies with shareholder-investors from countries where Euronext operates. It also appears, however, that the (necessarily) president-in-waiting Camil Beutin intends to “dig into” some files with issues that fall within the logic of rationalization and streamlining of ATHEX’s operations. Bank of Epirus received signals for January On December 15, the Executive Act of the Governor (EPATh) of the Bank of Greece was issued regarding the conditions for converting cooperative banks into public limited companies. Essentially, the BoG gave the green light to the four cooperative banks (Karditsa, Chania, Epirus, Thessaly) to obtain a nationwide license provided they have minimum share capital of €18 million. The Bank of Epirus held an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders on December 29 to convert into a public limited company, in order to open the way for the entry of strategic investor Peter Nomikos, who has expressed his intention to invest €30 million. Information suggests that the management of the Bank of Epirus now has clear indications that the fit & proper approval of P. Nomikos will come from the SSM within January, and therefore it is preparing the ground for a €30 million share capital increase. It is important that the capital increase will take place without dilution, but at the book value of the Bank of Epirus—though we will see this. All cooperative banks are seeking a strategic investor Based on the EPATh of the Bank of Greece, the former Cooperative Banks must adjust their own funds no later than March 31, 2026, and of course must have completed the process of converting into public limited companies in order to attract investors. Information indicates that Cooperative Bank of Thessaly is one step closer to the entry of a strategic investor; Karditsa has already expanded into neighboring prefectures but has not yet announced a broadening of its shareholder base; while in Chania, Ioannis Michos, coming from London, has joined as Executive Member of the Board with the goal of capital strengthening. The issue of capital is extremely important, since banking is now a very expensive business. Whether a bank has 1 branch or 100 branches, the very costly IT systems must be installed, supervisory capital must be available, and auditing procedures must be complete and operational. The game has started, and the efforts to capture market shares will be of exceptional interest. Teachers, police officers, and firefighters in Intralot A significant number of domestic mutual funds have taken positions in Intralot. As shown by the company’s shareholder register at the recent General Meeting, the largest positions are held by Alpha Bank and Optima mutual funds (Optima Greek Balanced, Optima Greek Equity) with approximately 6.6 million shares each; the National Asset Management mutual funds with approximately 5.6 million shares; while a significant position continues to be held by K. Antonopoulos, former CEO of the company, with approximately 9.2 million shares. Beyond that, there are smaller positions held by pension funds such as the Teachers Retirement System of Texas, funds for police officers and firefighters of New Jersey, mutual funds of Vanguard, Aviva, BlackRock, MorningStar, etc. Swiss franc: Who will ultimately say “yes” to the restructuring Banks have already started running their models for Swiss franc loans, as the new year brings developments. In about two months, borrowers will be called upon to decide whether they will join the restructuring, making a decision that will determine the course of their loan from now on. Banks are trying to determine the acceptance mix of the restructuring, since this is what will lead them to accurately calculate their provisions. According to banks’ estimates, those who can join the restructuring are borrowers without income criteria, and they will do so if their loan is not particularly mature. If, however, it is mature, given that their interest rate increases from 0% plus a 1% spread to 2.90%, they have no reason to do so. On the other hand, banks estimate that the greatest interest in the restructuring will come from those entitled to higher haircuts, based on income criteria. For this group, joining the restructuring may prove to be more attractive and a substantial relief, since the haircut reaches 50% and the interest rate 2.30%. However, a significant issue arises here: to what extent these particular borrowers can service the restructuring. It is worth highlighting an important advantage for many borrowers with a long repayment horizon: by converting the loan into euros, they essentially start from a point of departure where from then on they will see the outstanding balance of their loan gradually decrease—something that until now did not happen, due to the continuous appreciation of the Swiss franc. 25 listed companies have closed 280 meetings in Paris On January 29, 2026, a Thursday, the Piraeus Bank roadshow with companies listed on the Athens Exchange will finally take place at the famous Espace Cléry in Paris. Participation has already been locked in for 21 listed companies, and an impressively large number of one-on-one meetings with investors—more than 280—has been recorded. There is particular activity and interest for the “newcomers” to this institution, smaller-cap companies such as Profile, Alumil, AVAX, and Alter Ego. On the banking side, participation has already been confirmed (also with many meetings) by Alpha Bank, Piraeus Bank, and Bank of Cyprus, followed by Metlen, Motor Oil, TITAN, OPAP, GEK TERNA, PPC, Athens International Airport, Cenergy, ELVALHALCOR, Aegean, HelleniQ Energy, Lamda Development, AVAX, KRI-KRI. Information indicates that the final number of participants will certainly reach 25, provided a sufficient number of one-on-one meetings is secured. Espace Cléry is an imposing, historic building in Paris’s 2nd arrondissement, in the heart of Sentier, and was once the residence of the famous painter Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun. There, the 25 listed companies will paint the future of the Athens Stock Exchange… The background behind the shipping deals of the Greeks Greek shipowners continue to work quietly and methodically, letting their moves speak for themselves. During the festive period, the “hits” were many. On the newbuilding front, Aegean Bulk Co. Inc. closed four 82,000 dwt bulkers at Hengli Shipbuilding (Dalian), with deliveries in 2027–2028—a move read as a steady investment in capacity, without haste but with a clear horizon. At the same time, Cape Shipping shows it is not moving away from crude: one firm and one optional VLCC 319,000 dwt at Qingdao Beihai Shipyard, for 2028, with scrubbers and a price around $119 million. Details matter here. In tankers, Capital Ship Management added two orders and two optional LR2/Aframax 114,000 dwt at Hengli, for delivery in 2028, discreetly strengthening its portfolio. V Group, on the other hand, opted for containers: two feeder 1,930 TEU at Guangzhou Wenchong Shipyard, LNG dual-fuel, with deliveries 2028–2029. Those who follow the trends take notes. And in LPG, Benelux Overseas proceeded with two VLACs 93,000 cbm at HD Hyundai in South Korea, also dual-fuel, with delivery in 2028—a move showing persistence in a specific strategic path. In second-hand tonnage, the Greeks were not absent. The capesize ANTONIS ANGELICOUSSIS (177,855 dwt, 2007, Shanghai Waigaoqiao) changed hands at $20.5 million to Greek interests, while Oceanstar Management Inc. acquired the Ultramax IVS WINDSOR (60,279 dwt, 2016, Oshima) with cranes, for $26 million. At the same time, Greek-controlled vessels were also on the sellers’ side: the Handysize APHRODITE M (36,000 dwt, 2011, SPP) at $12.5 million, as well as the pair of Post-Panamax PORTO KAGIO and PORTO GERMENO (5,908 / 5,570 TEU, 2002, Koyo Dockyard), linked to Costamare, at $17 million each. The background shows that these are not spasmodic moves. Over the last twelve months, Greek interests count 132 new orders, 158 second-hand purchases, and 14 sales for recycling. As 2025 reached its end, the picture is clear: fleet renewal, careful choices, and a game played without noise but with clear targeting. Navios: Premium now, but with timing risk The three-year charter of Navios Destiny of Navios, interests of Angeliki Frangou, at $34,000 per day from Cosco shows that the company is selling market strength in the present, securing premium revenues for a vessel whose age under other conditions would pressure rates. From analysts’ perspective, this is clearly accretive for upcoming results and improves the short-term cash flow picture. However, timing matters. The question is not whether the deal is good today—because it is. It is whether, in 18 or 24 months, the market will be higher or lower than these levels. Navios appears to be choosing certainty over optionality. For Wall Street, this is neither right nor wrong. It is simply a clear stance on how it currently reads the container shipping cycle. Petros Panagiotidis’ reverse split In the language of Wall Street analysts, Robin Energy’s move constitutes an act of compliance. The 1:5 reverse split was not carried out to change the narrative, but to close a technical risk: the loss of the Nasdaq’s $1 minimum price requirement. With the stock at $0.71, the management of Petros Panagiotidis chose the most direct and institutionally acceptable path. The result—a price of $3.58—restores the relationship with the market without creating expectations that cannot be supported. The $1 million buyback that preceded it is read by funds as a signal of stabilization, not as an aggressive positioning. At the same time, the data from the LPG carriers provide what managers are looking for: cash-flow visibility. Contracts with well-known counterparties, locked-in revenues of more than $5.5 million, and coverage of 59% of days for 2026 are not impressive, but they reduce risk. That is exactly what is reflected in the models. Robin, a spin-off of Toro Corp, is not attempting a high-profile repositioning. It demonstrates discipline with market rules and a focus on operational performance, with the MR tanker following the seasonal improvement in charter rates. For institutional investors, the message is clear: no promises of capital gains, predictability, and remaining on the board. The first victim of 2026 will be the yen Hedge funds are very much like sharks. Once they smell blood, they rush to devour whatever is still alive. At this time, many hedge funds have taken positions against the Japanese yen at levels that strongly resemble the crisis of July 2024. More than 85,000 contracts of net short positions were recorded on December 14, betting on further weakening of the Japanese currency. It all starts with the interest-rate differential between the dollar and the yen, which today reaches as much as 3 percentage points. The Bank of Japan, despite the recent rate hikes it deemed necessary, is moving cautiously so as not to choke growth. The problem, however, lies in Japan’s real interest rates. They remain negative, since inflation is running faster than the BoJ’s rates. Those who hold yen-denominated accounts see their purchasing power eroding and are seeking more profitable deposit options. This is a classic déjà vu. Around this time last year, the dollar–yen exchange rate had exceeded 160, forcing the Ministry of Finance to proceed with immediate intervention to support the national currency. Some believe the same will happen this year. That is why they are taking short positions, expecting intervention. The U.S. stock market is flying. But not all of it… Everyone admires the U.S. stock indices, their resilience and momentum. But indices do not tell the whole truth. The 10 largest companies on Wall Street now account for 22% of global stock market capitalization. This is the highest level of the past 50 years. The top five alone reach 15%. It is a historic record. Goldman Sachs processed a chart of funding spreads that reveals the other side of the story. Professional investors are moving with extreme caution. Funding spreads are dropping sharply despite the upward course of the S&P 500. This divergence is a classic warning: when large institutional investors reduce their leverage even as the market rises, they are usually pricing in major turbulence. Concentration in a few stocks—the famous “Magnificent Seven” and a few more technology giants—creates the illusion of diversification. All investment advisors urge diversification: don’t put all your eggs in one basket, diversify your investment choices. An investor who thinks that by holding a global index ETF they are diversified, in reality has 22% of their exposure in just 10 companies. In roughly the same sector. Obviously, these 10 companies stand out today for their size and prospects. But if there is a sudden change of scenery, if something changes in laws and regulations, what will happen? Already today, investors in Artificial Intelligence companies are no longer satisfied with potential; they want concrete results after three years of gigantic investments. But what if those investments do not deliver as expected? What if something unforeseen happens? Explore related questions

Greetings. Today we are starting the last Dark Room of 2025, with wishes for health and happiness in the salvific new year 2026, until we speak again, God willing, on Monday, January 5. Until then, and with the permission of our good farmers who are slightly relaxing the roadblocks, we will be able to go on holiday or at least move around the Greek countryside, probably with somewhat more wintry weather. Perhaps even with a little snow—don’t imagine anything dramatic. Otherwise, it seems that there must have been a lot of backlash in society against the tactics and behavior of the farmers who block the roads (something… more than what fell on the government), and that’s why they decided to step a bit aside and open the roads somewhat so people can go on their holidays or return to their homes. An era of frenzy… The truth is that in all the years I’ve been working, I don’t remember a single time, under any government, when the prime minister called a professional group—farmers or anyone else—to dialogue and they refused to go and instead sent an ultimatum. You might say, here we saw a soldier—indeed from the Special Forces—speaking at a protest rally about the budget, and the KKE and SYRIZA issuing statements because he was removed from the Special Forces and even received a prison sentence in the Army.

Star manager Tiffany Hsiao returned to Matthews Asia in mid-November after a stint managing a private fund for Artisan Partners. In mid-December, she was joined by two members of her team from Artisan. It does not appear that she’ll be responsible for individual funds just now but will, instead, work with Mark Headley and the existing Matthews managers “to generate new perspectives and insights across portfolios.” This is unalloyedly good news for Matthews investors, and we’ll reach out to Mark and Tiffany in the month ahead to see what she’s seeing. “The Wildermuth Fund is in liquidation pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) in June 2023. Additionally, in June 2023, the Fund suspended sales of Fund shares and quarterly repurchase offers,” with BW Asset Management brought on board to oversee the liquidation. Oddly, 30 months later, the fund has no audited financial statements, which might explain the lack of, well, liquidation? On June 1, 2026, three Baillie Gifford funds will become ETFs. Technically, these are mergers where a shell ETF is created, and it then acquires all of the assets and liabilities of a preceding mutual fund. On January 9, 2026, a series of BNY Mellon fixed income funds will become active, transparent ETFs with “the same management fee and an estimated lower total annual expense ratio” as their predecessors. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Impax Global Sustainable Infrastructure Fund will become the Impax Global Infrastructure ETF. The advisor expects a lower expense ratio will follow, but hasn’t offered any details. The Snowball ETF is in registration and has no connection with the Mutual Fund Observer or its editor. It is an actively managed ETF that will invest in U.S. securities and securities of issuers of foreign developed markets through ADRs. The ETF will be managed by Gabe Plotkin. Expenses have not been stated as of this writing. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Towle Value Fund (formerly the Towle Deep Value Fund) becomes the Towle Value ETF. Expenses will be capped at 0.85%. Vanguard announced the launch of its Vanguard Core-Plus Bond Index ETF (BNDP), a new fixed income offering designed to deliver broad, diversified exposure to the U.S. taxable bond market. It will have an estimated expense ratio of just 0.05%. Josh Barrickman will lead day-to-day oversight of BNDP. On the topic of Vanguard, it unveiled its first target date fund since 2003, when it offered its Vanguard Target Retirement series. The Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income series will follow the path of its flagship funds until age 55, when it begins allocating to the TIAA Secure Income Account, a savings annuity. A savings annuity lets you build up money over time and later convert it into an income stream for life backed by the insurance company. By age 65, the annuity portion will reach 25% of the portfolio, and investors can decide whether to convert that portion into lifetime income payments. This series will only be available through defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. Fees start at 0.08% for the mutual fund and can be lower for collective investment trusts, depending on plan size. The Invesco QQQ Trust has received approval to be reorganized from a unit investment trust to an open-end ETF. Trading of the reorganized ETF commenced on December 22nd. As part of the conversion, shareholders of Invesco QQQ will benefit from a decrease in the fund’s total expense ratio from 0.20% to 0.18%. The reclassification also provides the opportunity for Invesco QQQ to reinvest income and participate in securities lending. There will be no tax implications from this conversion for QQQ investors. Nope. All is well. Effective March 10, 2026, American Century Disciplined Core Value Fund will be renamed Disciplined Value Fund, while the Equity Growth Fund will be renamed Disciplined Core Equity Fund. On December 8, 2025, AMG Montrusco Bolton Large Cap Growth Fund became the AMG GW&K Small Cap Growth Fund, which involves a complete strategy change from large cap to small cap and from non-diversified to diversified. The new management team has done a perfectly fine job running the AMG GW&K Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund for the past four years. On December 15, 2025, the $7 million Gabelli Automation ETF became the Gabelli Global Technology Leaders ETF. The plan is to become a global, all-cap fund that invests in companies with “market leadership and competitive advantages.” Effective after the close of business on February 13, 2026, the Goldman Sachs Balanced Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Conservative Allocation Fund, the Goldman Sachs Growth and Income Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to Goldman Sachs Moderate Allocation Fund, and the Goldman Sachs Growth Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Growth Allocation Fund. There will also be changes to the funds’ investment strategies, which shareholders should investigate. The GS filing did not specify what those changes will be, only that there will be changes and that paragraph 17 of the prospectus should be deleted in its entirety and replaced with … The $5 million Alger Weatherbie Enduring Growth ETF, a mid-cap growth ESG growth ETF, has already liquidated its portfolio and will cease operations on Christmas Eve 2025. The team also runs the larger but not particularly distinguished Specialized Growth Fund for Alger. Ancora MicroCap Fund will cease operations on February 27, 2026. Azoria 500 Meritocracy ETF and Azoria TSLA Convexity ETF disappeared on December 15, 2025. The $12 million ClearBridge Sustainable Infrastructure ETF will liquidate and dissolve on or about January 29, 2026. CoinShares Bitcoin Leverage ETF was dissolved and liquidated on December 16, 2025. Defiance Daily Target 2x Long PM ETF went up in smoke (that’s a joke about the fund’s sole holding, Philip Morris) on December 23, 2025. Defiance Enhanced Long Vol ETF and Defiance Daily Target 2X Long JPM ETF ceased their defiance on December 31, 2025. DWS Floating Rate Fund will be liquidated on or about March 23, 2026. Assuming shareholder approval, the tiny, one-star Fidelity U.S. Low Volatility Equity Fund would be reorganized on a tax-free basis with and into the $1.5 billion, two-star Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF on May 26, 2026. The ETF has substantially outperformed the fund, though both invest in US stocks. First Trust/Confluence Small Cap Value Fund will be liquidated on or around February 20, 2026. First Trust Riverfront Dynamic Europe ETF will become noticeably less dynamic on or around January 16, 2026 Goldman Sachs ESG Emerging Markets Equity Fund and Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity ex. China Fund will both cease operations on February 13, 2026. IDX Risk-Managed Digital Assets Strategy Fund will be cashed out on or about January 18, 2026. Invesco Real Assets ESG ETF, Invesco MSCI Green Building ETF, Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users, and Decentralized Commerce ETF will all undergo termination and liquidation on February 25, 2026. Invesco Environmental Focus Municipal Fund will be terminated on January 6, 2026. Invesco MSCI World SRI Index Fund is gone as of February 24, 2026. Shareholders have been asked to approve the reorganization of Longleaf Partners International Fund into Longleaf Partners Global Fund. Matthews China Dividend Fund will be merged into Matthews Asia Dividend Fund on or about January 27, 2026. Morgan Stanley Institutional High Yield Portfolio is expected to liquidate on or about January 28, 2026. The one-star, $1 million Morgan Stanley Institutional American Resilience Portfolio will be declared non-resilient on or about January 16, 2026. Neuberger Berman U.S. Equity Impact Fund loses impact on or about February 19, 2026. Neuberger Berman Municipal High Income Fund and Neuberger Berman Municipal Impact Fund are being merged into Neuberger Berman Municipal Intermediate Bond Fund; no date for the merger is available. PGIM Jennison NextGeneration Global Opportunities Fund will be liquidated on February 10, 2026, followed by PGIM Jennison International Small-Mid Cap Opportunities Fund on or about February 24, 2026. The three-star, $44 million Prospector Capital Appreciation Fund and the four-star, $94 million Prospector Opportunity Fund will be liquidated on or about December 30, 2025. The Capital Appreciation Fund was managed at launch by three guys who were sorts of stars: Kevin O’Brien who managed Neuberger Berman Genesis, Richard P. Howard, a long-time manager of T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation (PRWCX), and John Gillespie of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock and New Age Media, who were hopeful of bringing a fresh take on a strategy that Mr. Howard had done brilliantly with. The fund paced PRWCX for about three years, then began to fall behind. Mr. Howard left in 2014, as did Mr. Gillespie in 2021. The funds on the “WTF were you thinking” short-list disappeared on December 29, 2025: STKd 100% MSTR & 100% COIN ETF (APED), STKd 100% SMCI & 100% NVDA ETF (SPCY) and STKd 100% UBER & 100% TSLA ETF (ZIPP). Assuming shareholder approval, on March 20, 2026, Saturna Bond Income Fund and Saturna Short-Term Bond Fund both merge into Saturna Sustainable Bond Fund, while the $12 million five-star Saturna Global High Income Fund (which is about 30% equities) merges into three-star, $25 million Saturna Core Fund (which is about 63% equities). Shareowners will be asked to vote on these Reorganizations at a shareowner meeting that is anticipated to be held on February 27, 2026. On March 30, 2026, the $25 million Saturna Sustainable Equity Fund, a global fund that’s 50/50 US/international, merges into the Saturna International Fund without the need for shareholder approval. Stewart Investors Worldwide Leaders Fund was liquidated on December 16, 2025. T. Rowe Price Asia Opportunities Fund will be merged with and into the T. Rowe Price New Asia Fund on or about April 17, 2026. Around the same time, the T. Rowe Price International Disciplined Equity Fund will be reorganized on a tax-free basis with and into the T. Rowe Price Overseas Stock Fund. VictoryShares International Volatility Weighted ETF will liquidate on or about February 4, 2026. Volatility Shares 2x Wheat ETF and 2x Corn ETF disappear on January 30, 2026. Voya Global Perspectives Portfolio will be liquidated on or about May 15, 2026. The Shadow here!

Title: My 2026 Investment Plan

Time Published: 2025-12-31T04:50:00Z

I recently automated withdrawals from one conservative Traditional IRA (Core TIRA) into my short-term investment bucket for basic spending needs and emergencies. Previously, I automated withdrawals from a more aggressive Traditional IRA for longer-term discretionary spending needs. This exercise increased my focus on income. I just added Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) to my Core TIRA sub-portfolio as a lower-risk income fund rather than to pursue higher returns. The Core TIRA is conservate Traditional IRA, within the Intermediate Investment Bucket, that is intended to have long-term returns of 7% or more on average, have maximum drawdowns of -15% or less during a severe bear market, and provide steady income of at least 4%. This sub-portfolio has an allocation to stocks of 25%, but utilizes six funds classified as “flexible portfolio” or “alternative”. Now that I have completed the Core TIRA portfolio, I am preparing for a mid-2026 review when a bond matures and needs to be reinvested. In this article, I review historical distribution yields and look at the life-of-fund drawdowns and correlations. I evaluate the performance of the Core TIRA over the past five years with and without Standpoint Multi-Asset as a potential purchase, and compare the results against Vanguard Global Wellesley. I conclude with long-term views of the economy by the OECD, the Federal Reserve survey of professional forecasters, and a look at Vanguard’s time-varying portfolio. I wanted to understand the potential for the funds in my Core TIRA to produce a steady income of 4% per year. Some funds in the Core TIRA have yields, including capital gains, that fluctuate with the interest rate cycle, others that fluctuate according to the stock market cycle, and still others that provide a steady stream of income. I calculated the total distribution since 2019 by year from historical prices at the NASDAQ website and distribution history from Seeking Alpha. Yields for 2025 will change with end-of-year distributions. Table #1 shows the yields per year for each of the funds in my Core TIRA, with red shading indicating the lowest yield and blue shading the highest. All of the funds yielded at least 3.2% over the past six years, with PAIMX yielding 6.0%. Those whose inception date is after 2019 have the symbol highlighted in yellow. Three funds (FPFIX, JAAA, PVCMX) have higher yields when interest rates are high, and may have downward pressure on yields as interest rates fall. Those whose yield fluctuates more with the stock market cycle (PCBAX, AVALX, CTFAX) appear to have larger distributions when opportunities in the stock market appear to be low. PMAIX and PONAX have the most consistent distributions, with PMAIX having the potential for a higher total return. Of the two funds that I am considering adding in my mid-2026 review, EAGMX has high steady yields, while REMIX has a low correlation to the S&P 500 and bonds, and a higher potential for total return. Table #1: Historical Distribution Yield Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, Seeking Alpha, NASDAQ. The objective of the Core TIRA portfolio, including the bond ladder, is to provide steady returns and cash flow that grow with inflation into my Investment Bucket #1 for spending even through a secular bear market. Table #2 shows how funds in my Core TIRA have performed over their lives, sorted from lowest risk to highest. All of the funds had an APR of almost 4% or higher during their lives. “APR Min 10-yr Roll” shows the return for the worst ten-year rolling period within the life of the fund. The purpose of finding uncorrelated funds is to ensure that funds are not moving down at the same time. For long-term stability, I like CTFAX and PMAIX, which had “APR Min 10-yr Roll” of 4.7% or more. Table #2: Author’s Core TIRA Portfolio – Life of Fund Metrics Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I used Portfolio Visualizer to further analyze the Core TIRA portfolio for the past five years, including adding REMIX as shown in Table #3. I compare it to Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX), which I also own elsewhere. The link to Portfolio Visualizer Portfolio Backtesting is provided here. Table #3: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Figure #1 shows the growth of $10,000 invested in the Core TIRA with and without REMIX, and Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX). I like how REMIX fits into the Core TIRA portfolio, and it increases income. I own Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts for its professional management and simplicity. Figure #1: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer The funds can be loosely divided into three groups based on the past six years: 1) those that had low drawdowns (PVCMX, FPFIX, PCBAX, EAGMX), 2) those that had their maximum drawdown during The Great Normalization with rising rates (PONAX, PZRMX, CTFAX, and IAU), and 3) those that had their maximum drawdown during the COVID bear market (PMAIX, AVALX). Table #4 is the correlation matrix for the funds. They have low correlation with each other; however, PONAX, PZRMX, PMAIX, and CTFAX are moderately correlated. Table #4: Correlation Matrix Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer My conservative Core TIRA sub-portfolio consists of three funds classified as “alternatives”, three mixed asset funds in the “Flexible Portfolio” Lipper Category, and two in the “Multi-Sector Income” Category. I try to capture the objective and strategy of the funds below: Alternative Global Macro: Lipper Definition: Funds that, by prospectus language, invest around the world using economic theory to justify the decision-making process. The strategy is typically based on forecasts and analysis about interest rate trends, the general flow of funds, political changes, government policies, intergovernmental relations, and other broad systemic factors. These funds generally trade a wide range of markets and geographic regions, employing a broad range of trading ideas and instruments. Morningstar classifies PCBAX as “Macro Trading”, but EAGMX as “Nontraditional Bond”. Absolute Return: Lipper Definition: Funds that aim for positive returns in all market conditions. The funds are not benchmarked against a traditional long-only market index but rather have the aim of outperforming a cash or risk-free benchmark. David Snowball wrote Standpoint Multi-Asset Fund: Forcing Me to Reconsider in the November 2021 MFO Newsletter: “The fund provides exposure to equities (which help in times of economic growth or inflation), fixed income (which buffers deflationary periods and stock market declines), and commodities (which are uncorrelated with the first two, making it possible to minimize the effects of both sustained price changes and of an equity market decline). Half of the portfolio is invested in low-cost ETFs to give exposure to the global equity market. The argument is simple: over time, equities make serious money, especially if you don’t overpay for them. The fund holds eight equity ETFs charging between 3 and 7 basis points. The other half of the portfolio is managed futures positions. The positions can be in stocks and fixed income, as well as currencies and commodities. ‘Once a year we pull down the information on all the future contracts in the world, arrayed from most liquid to least liquid. We exclude the untradeable, then select the 75 most liquid in six sectors which includes equity index futures, bond futures, currencies, metals, energy, and agricultural commodities.’ Using a market following strategy, the futures contracts allow the portfolio’s exposure to equity markets to be increased beyond its 50% base (it was at 65% in mid-summer) or decreased to near zero.” Flexible Portfolio: Lipper Definition: Funds that allocate their investments to both domestic and foreign securities across traditional asset classes with a focus on total return. The traditional asset classes utilized are common stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Morningstar classifies PZRMX as “Global Conservative Allocation”, PMAIX as “Global Moderate Allocation”, and CTFAX as “Tactical Allocation”. In Figure #2, I compare Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) to PCBAX, PMAIX, and CTFAX. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) has a smooth, low-risk profile and yields 5.6%. EAGMX had a maximum drawdown of -3% during the Great Financial Crisis, while PCBAX had a drawdown of -29%. I bought PCBAX because it has returned 4.9% annualized since 2010, while EAGMX returned 3.4%. I favor REMIX for its low correlation to other funds in the Core TIRA. Figure #2: Comparison of Funds in Watch List to Core Funds in Portfolio Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. During the first half of this decade, the investment environment has experienced a lot of turbulence. I expect the second half to be more turbulent and have reduced risk accordingly. I recently attended the Economy Watch webinar by The Conference Board. They estimate that global growth will moderate over the next 15 years, and long-term growth in the U.S. will slow to less than 2.0%. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its OECD Economic Outlook, Volume 2025 Issue 2, which shows its estimates of real GDP growth in the U.S. to be below 2.0% in 2026 and 2027. The Fourth Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia estimates that real GDP will be 1.8% in 2026, 2.1% in 2027, and 1.8% in 2028. In my opinion, the U.S. economy is experiencing slowing growth in the late stage of the business cycle. Vanguard updated its time-varying portfolio in Bonds Remain In Favor In Time-Varying Model Portfolio. They describe it as, “The TVAA strategy is built on the framework of the Vanguard Asset Allocation Model (VAAM), driven by forecasts generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model (VCMM).” Their TVAA model results in a globally diversified 40/60 portfolio tilted toward value, as shown in Figure #3. The TVAA has an expected annualized 10-year return of 5.7%. Figure #3: Vanguard TVAA Model Source: Vanguard calculations, as of October 31, 2025 I use financial advisors at Vanguard to manage a portion of my portfolio using both index and actively managed funds. The time-varying strategy is not one of the options available. Over the past year, I have lowered my overall stock-to-bond allocation from 65% to 50% with a below-average allocation to technology because I expect stocks to have below-average returns. I invest in Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts, which has a 40/60 allocation, but also in Vanguard Global Wellington, which has a 60/40 allocation. I can sleep at night with the Bucket Approach and my Core TIRA account to meet essential spending needs and emergencies even in a secular bear market. During my mid-2026 review, I will ensure that sufficient funds are in place to meet 2027 withdrawals and confirm if I want to: 1) extend a rung in the bond ladder with iShares iBonds Dec 2034 Term Corporate ETF (IBDZ), 2) add Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to the Core TIRA, 3) increase the allocation to Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX) because of its focus on steady and high income, and 4) reduce investments in non-core bond funds. I don’t plan to sell any of the ten core funds in the Core TIRA. I wish everyone a happy and prosperous 2026. Lynn Bolin retired in June 2022 and is immensely enjoying the more relaxed lifestyle.

Title: January 1, 2026

Welcome to the New Year’s issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. We’re glad you’re here. Heraclitus, the famously elusive Greek philosopher, reminded his students that you cannot step into the same river twice. Both we and the river will have changed. According to legend, one of those students – snarky little barstid – replied: “I don’t think you can step into the same river once.” Even as we step, the river flows and changes. As do we. Heraclitus was speaking of a physical river. Centuries later, we have extended his insights to allow us to consider the River of Time itself: the continuous flow in which change happens, meaning accumulates, and our lives—and markets—actually unfold. January has that fluid quality. We think of ourselves standing on the bank of the River, looking backward and forward at once—convinced that the past can be measured and the future mapped, even as the present slips by almost unnoticed. The river does not pause for our resolutions. In reality, we don’t just get to watch time rush past; we are not on the bank, we are in the river. We may think we resolutely face the future, eyes upstream, scrying risk and opportunity. We may turn our back to the torrent, knowing that we can only know what has already passed and contemplating the dark sea into which it must eventually empty. We might be still and resolute, like a stone, or moving along with the flow. The young might experience a mere ankle-deep flow while some of us experience … the deeper currents pulling toward that wine-dark sea. Perspective matters. And metaphors matter because they teach us what to look for. From the riverbank, all motion feels alarming. From within the river, we begin to notice that not all movement means change, not all froth is consequential, and not all change arrives with noise. Some of what most shapes our lives—technological shifts, medical progress, environmental repair—moves steadily, almost invisibly, beneath the surface. This January issue of the Observer lingers over a stretch of the river that many hurried past. Amid the noise and anxiety of 2025, extraordinary things went quietly right: a vast expansion of green energy in China, meaningful progress against several endemic diseases, and other developments that rarely commanded headlines but may shape lives for decades to come. Uncertain times require clear thinking, and clear thinking requires … well, a functioning brain. In “New Year’s Resolution #1: Avoid lobotomies” we look at the threat that AI seductively poses to brains … yours, your alma mater’s, and your investment advisor’s. A short sidebar piece, “What Five AI Told Me About Investing in 2026, and what their answers tell you,” highlights the problematic patterns in AI’s response to an (admittedly unfair) question about what’s going to win in the year ahead. Our colleague Lynn Bolin contributes two complementary pieces exploring income-focused investing for the uncertain years ahead. In “My 2026 Investment Plan,” Lynn walks through the construction of his conservative Core TIRA portfolio – a traditional IRA designed to generate a steady income of at least 4% while limiting drawdowns to -15% during severe bear markets. He demonstrates how different funds yield differently depending on whether they’re responding to interest rate cycles or stock market cycles, and evaluates adding Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to improve diversification. Particularly valuable: Lynn’s analysis of how his portfolio performed through both the COVID bear market and the Great Normalization’s rising rates, and his discussion of why he’s moved from a 65% stock allocation to 50% as forecasts from the OECD, Federal Reserve, and Conference Board all point to slowing growth ahead. Vanguard’s own time-varying model now recommends a 40/60 stocks-to-bonds allocation – a near-revolutionary flip from the traditional 60/40. In “A Closer Look at Income Strategy,” Lynn drills deeper into the mechanics of generating steady income in an environment where short and intermediate Treasury yields are falling while long-term rates rise. Working from 30,000 feet (which Lipper categories produce income in low-yield environments) down to ground level (specific fund recommendations), he identifies funds that maintained consistent yields through multiple market cycles. His analysis reveals that some funds distribute more when stock market opportunities appear limited, while others fluctuate with interest rates – and a select few provide genuinely steady income regardless of market conditions. The payoff: an example portfolio that achieved 7.7% annual returns with a maximum drawdown of just -9.8% over the past six years while yielding 5.2%. The Shadow, as ever, surveys the month’s most consequential changes in the fund and ETF world in “Briefly Noted.” We also pause, briefly and with gratitude, to acknowledge those who have sustained the Observer—financially, intellectually, and through simple acts of encouragement. And then, before the current carries us onward, we raise a glass to what has been, to what is, and to what may yet emerge from upstream. Pessimism is easy. Way too easy, frankly. If I were to construct the Pessimism Industrial Complex, it would have three pillars: The federal government is controlled by toddlers, a bunch famous for tantrums when their irrational, I-am-the-universe demands are not met. And so we get the Trump Kennedy Center, chaired by Donald J. Trump and the Donald J. Trump US Institute for Peace. The Trump-class battleships that will populate The Golden Fleet. The Trump dollar coin. The Trump accounts for infants. The decision to make access to the national parks free on Trump’s birthday, which, I think, is somewhere in the month of Trumpruary. There are no adults left in the room. Interviews with three departing US senators made two points: (1) every member of the US Senate is appalled and (2) they’re all waiting “for the right time” to, you know, develop a spine, remember their oath of office, or something (“Why Won’t Senators Stand Up to Trump? We Asked 3 Who Called It Quits,” New York Times, 12/13/2025). Until then, the federal response to a global climate crisis is “don’t wanna and you can’t make me!” When you’re dealing with a creature named “The Doomsday Glacier,” it’s easy to foresee Bad Things Aplenty. The media loves reporting bad news. We don’t know where the newsroom adage “if it bleeds, it leads” originated – the confident online assertions about Hearst in the 1890s is unattributed and a random New York Magazine article in 1989 is laughably wrong – but it does express a well-documented truth. Bad news sells, terrible news sells more. A 20-year study of German media found a “significant, positive correlations between explicitly negative cover pages and the magazines’ sales” (Arango-Kure and Marcel Garz, “Bad News Sells,” Journal of Media Economics, 2014). Globally, every additional negative word added to a story’s title increases readership (Robertson, et al, “Negativity drives online news consumption,” Nature: Human Behavior, 2023; btw, their study of 105,000 online news stories also found that positive words in titles drove down readership) and the more negative a story is, the more frequently and widely it’s shared on social media (Watson, et al, “Negative online news articles are shared more to social media,” Scientific Reports, 2024). You love to doom-scroll. Doom‑scrolling, for the three of you who didn’t know, is the practiced art of dragging your thumb down an endless feed of bad news long after you have stopped learning anything new. It is not just “reading the news online”; it is staying locked in the loop of crisis headlines, live‑updated horrors, and algorithm-driven outrage until your mood and sense of the world are thoroughly saturated. Some psychologists speculate that it’s a hard-wired behavior; within evolutionary time-frames, our survival depends on obsessively locating and assessing all potential threats in our neighborhood (“is that a nice kitty or a creature whose nickname for me is ‘niblet’?”), and doom-scrolling is just the latest iteration of the impulse. Surveys and behavioral studies suggest that a substantial minority of adults, and a flat‑out majority of younger users, now report doom‑scrolling regularly (“Gen Z has a doomscrolling problem,” Newsweek, 5/11/2025). In those same studies, heavier doom‑scrolling is consistently associated with higher levels of stress, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and even secondary trauma symptoms, a joy of witnessing wave after wave of misery through a four‑inch screen (Satici, et al, “Doomscrolling Scale: its Association with Personality Traits, Psychological Distress, Social Media Use, and Wellbeing,” Applied Research in the Quality of Life, 2022). And, boy howdy, is there a fair number of regrettable developments in the world. Andrew Winston’s curiously optimistic essay in Forbes (“2025: the year sustainability didn’t die,” 12/21/2025) began with a fairly bracing list of negatives: … the harsh reality is the world’s greatest challenges [are] getting worse. Inequality grew, especially at the very top, where individuals amassed unfathomable wealth (hundreds of billions of dollars) and some corporate valuations hit unreal heights ($4 trillion to $5 trillion). Meanwhile, climate impacts escalated; political winds don’t change actual winds. For example, part of Los Angeles burned to the ground (at an estimated cost of up to $250 billion) during unprecedented wildfires, historic heat baked India, Pakistan, and the EU, and devastating floods in Texas killed dozens of children. Scientists told us that climate change is “beyond scientific dispute,” at “tipping points,” and “extremely dangerous” (and that the world will blow past the 1.5C warming target). Insurer Allianz issued an eye-popping report that climate change could “destroy capitalism.” In addition, the world got less democratic and pulled to the right and generally away from the sustainability agenda, making collective action even harder. This puts more pressure on businesses. And even facing headwinds, sustainability didn’t die. That’s the top story of the year. Let’s look at that and some other big themes. Well … yeah. But if pessimism feels effortless at the end of 2025, that is not just because the news is bad; it is because you are mainlining it, in real time, on an interface designed never to run out. Much of our success as a species is driven by two factors: a good plan and resilience in executing it. The media’s business model tends to emphasize doom because, well, doom sells. But 2025 offered remarkable evidence that when we commit to sustained action—plugging ozone holes, protecting beaches, installing solar panels, developing breakthrough medicines, restoring ecosystems—we can achieve transformations that once seemed impossible. In our draft letter, what follows are eleven pages of incredibly consequential, positive developments. Chip’s anguished plea, “have mercy on their eyes!” led us to share the news in two forms: a dozen bullet points here and a dozen pages of detail in a sidebar story entitled, “The Big Box of Delights.” So here’s what happened while doom was scrolling: In November, a liquor store employee in Virginia discovered broken bottles and an apparently intoxicated raccoon sleeping on the store’s bathroom floor. An animal control officer noted that he fell through a ceiling tile, “went on a rampage, drinking everything,” with a special fondness for … umm, whisky. The animal showed no signs of injury, according to local animal protection services, though they guessed the raccoon might be grappling with “a hangover” and regret over “poor life choices.” Figure 1: Raccoon regretting its poor life choices. Source: NBC News. The story delighted readers across the political spectrum—a rare moment of shared laughter in a divided time. But it became more than a viral moment when merchandise commemorating the raccoon’s night of debauchery raised a quarter of a million dollars for the local animal shelter that housed him. The Hanover County animal protection service teamed up with apparel maker Bonfire to create shirts, sweatshirts, cups, and stickers featuring the now-infamous image of a raccoon spreadeagled next to a spilled booze bottle, along with the words “Trashed Panda.” Through 12/22, they’ve sold 19,764 against a goal of 20,000. The drunk raccoon reminds us that hope sometimes arrives in unexpected forms: in a hungover raccoon that brings people together, in merchandise that funds animal care, in our capacity to find joy and meaning in the absurd. On Christmas Day, Pope Leo made his traditional papal “Urbi et Orbi” address, Latin for “To the City and to the World,” which summarizes the bad news (see above, plus your danged doomscroll) and prescribes a response: put aside indifference, stop scrolling and start acting, stand with the oppressed rather than the oppressive. “There will be peace when our monologues are interrupted and, enriched by listening, we fall to our knees before the humanity of the other.” Stop wasting our time demonizing one another? Dreamer. Progress is rarely dramatic. It’s built day by day through the determined efforts of scientists, healthcare workers, conservationists, educators, and ordinary citizens working to solve problems both great and small. While 2025’s headlines often focused on conflict and crisis, millions of people worldwide continued humanity’s long tradition of quietly building a better world. They dreamt of better, and acted. The answer to “what’s there to be optimistic about?” is the same as it was in 2025, and will be in 2027: enormous things happened because millions of good people rejected the counsel of despair, and that you probably didn’t hear about because doom sells better than progress. The choice isn’t between naive optimism and realistic despair. It’s between staying informed about what’s actually happening—the turtle populations recovering, the emissions curves bending, the diseases being eliminated, the hungover raccoons raising money for animal shelters—and letting a curated feed of catastrophe convince you that nothing good is possible. Step away from the mediated world and step into the immediate one. Put your phones away. Hug someone today. Smile at a stranger. Do a good deed. Read a book. We recommend Always Remember (2025), a singularly beautiful little 30-minute read that reminds you of important things you already know but need to hear. Subscribe to Nautilus, a site (and magazine) that reminds you that science is cool … and important. Consider joining The Conversation, a site that has actual researchers write clear articles about important topics (“Deepfakes leveled up in 2025. Here’s what’s coming next.”) Be like Jimmy the President. Be like Leo the Pope. Be like the Drunken Raccoon. Make a difference where you are. (Want cool pictures, more detail, and a couple more stories? Open “The Big Box o’ Delights.” Or, if you’re in the long-scroll version, just keep scrolling!) The question’s not hypothetical, at least for investors. In truth, you have no idea of what’s coming. If you knew, you’d be richer than Croesus. Two things are true when we stand in the river of time: we can see neither the river’s bottom nor what’s coming at us from just around the bend. The bottom might fall out. The torrent might be nearly upon us. We cannot know, but we’ve still got to act. In general, the guides that professionals use are called “capital market assumptions” – data-driven estimates of the range of likely outcomes given current inputs. “Given a CAPE of 40 and capex spending of X, the likeliest range of US equity returns over the next 3-5 years falls between…” The recommendations that flow from those assumptions are called “strategic asset allocations,” statements that say broadly “a prudent investor with an intermediate time horizon should plan on holding X% in equities, with the possibility of some adjustments as markets evolve.” The problem is that there are a million factors weighing on markets, but not all million – birth rates in Nigeria? thawing permafrost in Siberia? financial nihilism in Gen Z? – can be incorporated into the models. Different trillion-dollar advisors reach very different trillion-dollar conclusions about what course to chart. Two of the largest firms – BlackRock and Vanguard – seem to have reached starkly different conclusions about prudent investor behavior. Given Vanguard’s intrinsic conservativeness, their new recommendation seems particularly tectonic. Vanguard’s call: For investors with a medium-term outlook (3-5 years), flip the traditional 60% stocks/40% bonds allocation to 40/60. Same expected returns as 60/40, but with substantially less risk. Why? The S&P 500’s CAPE ratio sits at 40.40 – rivaling the dot-com bubble peak. Vanguard projects US equities will return just 3.5% to 5.5% annually over the next decade, while growth stocks (including the Magnificent Seven) may deliver only 2.3% to 4.3%. Meanwhile, bonds now offer 3.8% to 4.8% with far less volatility. Roger Aliaga-Díaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction: “We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity.” This isn’t panic or market timing. In a December podcast, Vanguard’s chief economists explained that “stay the course” never meant “never adjust your allocation.” It meant stay invested, avoid emotional decisions, but use evidence-based risk management. Their Time-Varying Asset Allocation model – driven by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model that processes decades of data on risk factors and returns – now suggests this is a moment for conservative asset allocation. They estimate a 25-30% probability that AI disappoints and fails to deliver on current expectations. Goldman Sachs concurs on muted US prospects, forecasting just 6.5% annual S&P 500 returns through 2035 – driven by earnings, not the multiple expansion that powered the last decade. They see better opportunities elsewhere: Emerging Markets (+10.9%), Asia ex-Japan (+10.3%), Japan (+8.2%). The “multiple expansion era” is over, they argue. Profit margins already jumped from 5% in 1990 to 13% today and can’t expand further. BlackRock takes the opposite view: Stay pro-risk, overweight US stocks on the AI theme. Yes, valuations are stretched, and concentration is concerning, but AI capital spending is transforming the economy at an unprecedented scale. The challenge isn’t whether to reduce equity exposure – it’s identifying which companies beyond the current winners will capture AI revenues as they spread across sectors. Their 2026 outlook emphasizes “the diversification mirage” – that traditional diversifiers like long-term Treasuries now offer diminished cushion, so seek idiosyncratic returns in private markets and active strategies instead. T. Rowe Price splits the difference: Neutral on equities overall but underweight US large-cap (-2.0%) while overweight small-cap, international, and emerging markets. They’re concerned about “the narrowness of AI trends” and prefer to position for market broadening. Like Vanguard, they’re underweight long-term bonds, worried about fiscal deficits keeping upward pressure on rates. What’s an investor to make of this? The honest answer is that nobody knows what’s upstream. Vanguard’s systematic approach says: when you can’t see around the bend, measure what you can – valuations, yields, historical risk/return relationships – and position defensively. BlackRock’s view: the AI build-out is real, the momentum is powerful, stay engaged but stay nimble. Both might be right over different time horizons. The shift isn’t just theoretical. Our colleague Lynn Bolin has reduced his overall stock allocation from 65% to 50% over the past year, positioning his conservative Core TIRA portfolio to weather what he expects will be a more turbulent second half of the decade. My own long-term allocation, which we discuss each February along with my portfolio, is 50/50. Research Affiliates, whose long-term asset allocation system has been broadly validated, offers striking support for the defensive shift. Their models project that a global 60/40 portfolio will deliver just 2.5% real returns over the next decade with a Sharpe ratio of 0.16. Their conservative model portfolio – shifting to 40% equity/60% bonds with commodities and inflation-linked assets – projects 3.5% real returns with a Sharpe ratio of 0.44. The more defensive portfolio projects higher returns with better risk-adjusted performance. Their analysis also reinforces Goldman’s geographic thesis: looking across asset classes globally, US large-cap growth shows near-zero risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio of -0.01), while developed ex-US large-cap value, emerging markets, and smaller international stocks all show meaningfully better prospects. The message is consistent: lighten on US growth, reduce overall equity exposure, look globally. The takeaway isn’t that one firm has discovered the answer. It’s that even trillion-dollar asset managers using sophisticated models reach honestly different conclusions from the same data. Vanguard says reduce equity risk because valuations are stretched and bonds are finally paying again. BlackRock says stay engaged because AI momentum is real and traditional diversifiers don’t work like they used to. Goldman says look elsewhere entirely – emerging markets and Asia offer better prospects than US equities. Research Affiliates’ models strongly favor the defensive positioning. Which suggests that broad diversification driven by your needs – not by greed or fear or the confident pronouncements of any single adviser – remains the most prudent course when standing in a river whose depths and currents we cannot fully know. The evidence from multiple independent sources supports a more conservative stance than the traditional 60/40 for those with intermediate time horizons. Whether that means 50/50, 40/60, or some other mix depends on your own circumstances, goals, and capacity to weather volatility. But the days of assuming that 60/40 will automatically deliver double-digit returns through multiple expansion and tech dominance? Those have already flowed past us. To the good folks we’ve met along the way, and with whom we chat too rarely. To Andrew and Michelle Foster of Seafarer Capital Partners for their vision of a better kind of fund company, and their enduring success. To Mark and Tina Oelschlager, the folks behind the small and excellent Towpath Focus Fund, for thoughtful talks and cheerful humanity … and enduring success.

To Dave Sherman, founder of Cohanzick / CrossingBridge, whose formidable intellect and Tigger-like energy has translated into a bunch of funds that consistently honor the credo, “return of investment is more important than return on investment.” To the inestimably talented Charles, maestro of MFO Premium, whose tools deserve about ten times the attention – and financial support – that they receive. To Chuck Jaffe, aka “Hurricane Chuck,” who’s still at it after all these years, and to Dan Wiener, who our colleague Ed Studzinski denominated as Dan Dan the Vanguard Man, who has had the sense to take a step back and enjoy life. To our colleague Lynn Bolin, who has done likewise and yet writes better than ever, and to The Shadow, who might yet find cause to slow down. To Victoria Odinotska of Kanter Public Relations, a bright spirit and humane voice who toils bravely while under the burden of the ongoing assault on her beloved homeland. To the good folks at Long/Short Advisors and Cook & Bynum for keeping in touch, thoughtfully and consistently, over the years. Finally, to our faithful subscribers and readers, thanks!

Title: BlackRock dumps, Saylor buys: Holiday chaos erupts as crypto market ends 2025

Together, they show two very different institutional approaches to Bitcoin exposure. While many regular investors were relaxing during the holidays, the world’s biggest asset manager was making major moves. BlackRock quietly transferred $214 million worth of Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] to Coinbase Prime in a series of year-end transactions, as reported by Arkham. These transfers come at a key moment for the company’s crypto ETFs, as both IBIT and ETHA are seeing falling investor interest. The on-chain activity suggests BlackRock is no longer just holding crypto; it’s actively managing liquidity to handle a wave of investor redemptions. The $214 million shift appears to be a direct response to cooling demand for U.S. crypto ETFs. Since 18th December, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has faced steady outflows, with $7.9 million leaving the fund on the 29th of December alone. That same day, all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs together saw $19.3 million in withdrawals. Ethereum ETFs are facing similar pressure, with BlackRock’s ETHA losing $13.3 million on the 29th of December, nearly doubling the entire day’s net outflow for Ethereum ETFs. This pattern shows that many institutional investors are pulling back, likely because of year-end tax-loss harvesting and profit-taking after a volatile final quarter. While ETF investors are stepping back, Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is doing the opposite. On the same day, BlackRock saw redemptions, Strategy bought another 1,229 BTC for $108.85 million as per Lookonchain data. The company paid an average of $88,568 per Bitcoin, raising its total holdings to an incredible 672,497 BTC. Despite recent market swings, Strategy is currently sitting on an unrealized profit of about $8.31 billion, a 16% gain overall. This creates an interesting contrast in the crypto market, wherein BlackRock is acting as a liquidity provider, moving BTC and ETH onto exchanges to help ETF investors cash out. Meanwhile, Strategy is acting as a liquidity sink, buying Bitcoin and holding it long-term, taking supply out of the market. Yet, despite all this movement, prices have barely reacted. Bitcoin at press time was changing hands at $87,900, up only 0.24% in 24 hours. On the other hand, Ethereum was trading at $2,974, with a small 0.45% gain. This price-flow divergence, with big movements of money without big moves in price, shows that the market likely expected these end-of-year withdrawals. Therefore, as we move into January, attention will shift from these withdrawals to the new year’s sentiment. Now, whether Saylor can pull retail investors back into the market is still unclear, but one thing is obvious from the on-chain data: the weak hands are exiting, and the biggest players are simply repositioning for 2026.

Title: Software taketh away faster than hardware giveth: Why C++ programmers keep growing fast despite competition, safety, and AI

Sutter’s Mill Herb Sutter on software development 2025 was another great year for C++. It shows in the numbers Before we dive into the data below, let’s put the most important question up front: Why have C++ and Rust been the fastest-growing major programming languages from 2022 to 2025? Primarily, it’s because throughout the history of computing “software taketh away faster than hardware giveth.” There is enduring demand for efficient languages because our demand for solving ever-larger computing problems consistently outstrips our ability to build greater computing capacity, with no end in sight. [6] Every few years, people wonder whether our hardware is just too fast to be useful, until the future’s next big software demand breaks across the industry in a huge wake-up moment of the kind that iOS delivered in 2007 and ChatGPT delivered in November 2022. AI is only the latest source of demand to squeeze the most performance out of available hardware. Quick quiz: What are the two biggest constraints on computing growth in 2025? What’s in shortest supply? Take a moment to answer that yourself before reading on… — — — If you answered exactly “power and chips,” you’re right — and in the right order. Chips are only our #2 bottleneck. It’s well known that the hyperscalars are competing hard to get access to chips. That’s why NVIDIA is now the world’s most valuable company, and TSMC is such a behemoth that it’s our entire world’s greatest single point of failure. But many people don’t realize: Power is the #1 constraint in 2025. Did you notice that all the recent OpenAI deals were expressed in terms of gigawatts? Let’s consider what three C-level executives said on their most recent earnings calls. [1] Amy Hood, Microsoft CFO (MSFT earnings call, October 29, 2025): [Microsoft Azure’s constraint is] not actually being short GPUs and CPUs per se, we were short the space or the power, is the language we use, to put them in. Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO (AMZN earnings call, October 30, 2025): [AWS added] more than 3.8 gigawatts of power in the past 12 months, more than any other cloud provider. To put that into perspective, we’re now double the power capacity that AWS was in 2022, and we’re on track to double again by 2027. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA CEO (NVDA earnings call, November 19, 2025): The most important thing is, in the end, you still only have 1 gigawatt of power. One gigawatt data centers, 1 gigawatt power. … That 1 gigawatt translates directly. Your performance per watt translates directly, absolutely directly, to your revenues. That’s why the future is enduringly bright for languages that are efficient in “performance per watt” and “performance per transistor.” The size of computing problems we want to solve has routinely outstripped our computing supply for the past 80 years; I know of no reason why that would change in the next 80 years. [2] The list of major portable languages that target those key durable metrics is very short: C, C++, and Rust. [3] And so it’s no surprise to see that in 2025 all three continued experiencing healthy growth, but especially C++ and Rust. Let’s take a look. Programming is a hot market, and programmers are in long-term high-growth demand. (AI is not changing this, and will not change it; see Appendix.) “Global developer population trends 2025” (SlashData, 2025) reports that in the past three years the global developer population grew about 50%, from just over 31 million to just over 47 million. (Other sources are consistent with that: IDC forecasts that this growth will continue, to over 57 million developers by 2028. JetBrains reports similar numbers of professional developers; their numbers are smaller because they exclude students and hobbyists.) And which two languages are growing the fastest (highest percentage growth from 2022 to 2025)? Rust, and C++. To put C++’s growth in context: C++ is a living language whose core job to be done is to make the most of hardware, and it is continually evolving to stay relevant to the changing hardware landscape. The new C++26 standard contains additional support for hardware parallelism on the latest CPUs and GPUs, notably adding more support for SIMD types for intra-CPU vector parallelism, and the std::execution Sender/Receiver model for general multi-CPU and GPU concurrency and parallelism. But wait — how could this growth be happening? Isn’t C++ “too unsafe to use,” according to a spate of popular press releases and tweets by a small number of loud voices over the past few years? Let’s tackle that next… C++’s rate of security vulnerabilities has been far overblown in the press primarily because some reports are counting only programming language vulnerabilities when those are a smaller minority every year, and because statistics conflate C and C++. Let’s consider those two things separately. First, the industry’s security problem is mostly not about programming language insecurity. Year after year, and again in 2025, in the MITRE “CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses” (mitre.org, 2025) only three of the top 10 “most dangerous software weaknesses” are related to language safety properties. Of those three, two (out-of-bounds write and out-of-bounds read) are directly and dramatically improved in C++26’s hardened C++ standard library which does bounds-checking for the most widely used bounded operations (see below). And that list is only about software weaknesses, when more and more exploits bypass software entirely. Why are vulnerabilities increasingly not about language issues, or even about software at all? Because we have been hardening our software; this is why the cost of zero-day exploits has kept rising, from thousands to millions of dollars. So attackers stop pursuing that as much, and switch to target the next slowest animal in the herd. For example, “CrowdStrike 2025 Global Threat Report” (CrowdStrike, 2025) reports that “79% of [cybersecurity intrusion] detections were malware-free,” not involving programming language exploits. Instead, there was huge growth not only in non-language exploits, but even in non-software exploits, including a “442% growth in vishing [voice phishing via phone calls and voice messages] operations between the first and second half of 2024.” Why go to the trouble of writing an exploit for a use-after-free bug to infect someone’s computer with malware which is getting more expensive every year, when it’s easier to do some cross-site scripting that doesn’t depend on a programming language, and it’s easier still to ignore the software entirely and just convince the user to tell you their password on the phone? Second, for the subset that is about programming language insecurity, the problem child is C, not C++. A serious problem is that vulnerability statistics almost always conflate C and C++; it’s very hard to find good public sources that distinguish them. The only reputable public study I know of that distinguished between C and C++ is Mend.io’s as reported in “What are the most secure programming languages?” (Mend.io, 2019). Although the data is from 2019, as you can see the results are consistent across years. Can’t see the C++ bar? Pinch to zoom. 😉 Although C++’s memory safety has always been much closer to that of other modern popular languages than to that of C, we do have room for improvement and we’re doing even better in the newest C++ standard about to be released, C++26. It delivers two major security improvements, where you can just recompile your code as C++26 and it’s significantly more secure: Additionally, C++26 adds functional safety via contracts: preconditions, postconditions, and contract assertions in the language, that programmers can use to check that their programs behave as intended well beyond just memory safety. Beyond C++26, in the next couple of years I expect to see proposals to: I know of people who’ve been asking for C++ evolution to slow down a little to let compilers and users catch up, something like we did for C++03. But we like all this extra security, too. So, just spitballing here, but hypothetically: What if we focused C++29, the next release cycle of C++, to only issue-list-level items (bug fixes and polish, not new features) and the above “hardening” list (add more library hardening, remove more language undefined behavior)? I’m intrigued by this idea, not because security is C++’s #1 burning issue — it isn’t, C++ usage is continuing to grow by leaps and bounds — but because it could address both the “let’s pause to stabilize” and “let’s harden up even more” motivations. Focus is about saying no. Programming is growing fast. C++ is growing very fast, with a healthy long-term future because it’s deeply aligned with the overarching 80-year trend that computing demand always outstrips supply. C++ is a living language that continually adapts to its environment to fulfill its core mission, tracking what developers need to make the most of hardware. And it shows in the numbers. Here’s to C++’s great 2025, and its rosy outlook in 2026! I hope you have an enjoyable rest of the holiday period, and see you again in 2026. Thanks to Saeed Amrollahi Boyouki, Mark Hoemmen and Bjarne Stroustrup for motivating me to write this post and/or providing feedback. Finally, let’s talk about the topic no article can avoid: AI. C++ is foundational to current AI. If you’re running AI, you’re running CUDA (or TensorFlow or similar) — directly or indirectly — and if you’re running CUDA (or TensorFlow or similar), you’re probably running C++. CUDA is primarily available as a C++ extension. There’s always room for DSLs at the leading edge, but for general-purpose AI most high-performance deployment and inference is implemented in C++, even if people are writing higher-level code in other languages (e.g., Python). But more broadly than just C++: What about AI generally? Will it take all our jobs? (Spoiler: No.) AI is a wonderful and transformational tool that greatly reduces rote work, including problems that have already been solved, where the LLM is trained on the known solutions. But AI cannot understand, and therefore can’t solve, new problems — which is most of the current and long-term growth in our industry. What does that imply? Two main things, in my opinion… First, I think that people who think AI isn’t a major game-changer are fooling themselves. To me, AI is on par with the wheel (back in the mists of time), the calculator (back in the 1970s), and the Internet (back in the 1990s). [5] Each of those has been a game-changing tool to accelerate (not replace) human work, and each led to more (not less) human production and productivity. I strongly recommend checking out Adam Unikowsky’s “Automating Oral Argument” (Substack, July 7, 2025). Unikowsky took his own actual oral arguments before the United States Supreme Court and showed how well 2025-era Claude can do as a Supreme Court-level lawyer, and with what strengths and weaknesses. Search for “Here is the AI oral argument” and click on the audio player, which is a recording of an actual Supreme Court session and replaces only Unikowsky’s responses with his AI-generated voice saying the AI-generated text argument directly responding to each of the justices’ actual questions; the other voices are the real Supreme Court justices. (Spoiler: “Objectively, this is an outstanding oral argument.”) Second, I think that people who think AI is going to put a large fraction of programmers out of work are fooling themselves. We’ve just seen that, today, three years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, the number of human programmers is growing as fast as ever. Even the companies that are the biggest boosters of the “AI will replace programmers” meme are actually aggressively growing, not reducing, their human programmer workforces. Consider what three more C-level executives are saying. Sam Schillace, Microsoft Deputy CTO (Substack, December 19, 2025) is pretty AI-ebullient, but I do agree with this part he says well, and which resonates directly with Unikowsky’s experience above: If your job is fundamentally “follow complex instructions and push buttons,” AI will come for it eventually. But that’s not most programmers. Matt Garman, Amazon Web Services CEO (interview with Matthew Berman, X, August 2025) says bluntly: People were telling me [that] with AI we can replace all of our junior people in our company. I was like that’s … one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard. … I think AI has the potential to transform every single industry, every single company, and every single job. But it doesn’t mean they go away. It has transformed them, not replaced them. Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian CEO (Stratechery interview, December 2025) says it well: I think [AI]’s a huge force multiplier personally for human creativity, problem solving … If software costs half as much to write, I can either do it with half as many people, but [due to] core competitive forces … I will [actually] need the same number of people, I would just need to do a better job of making higher quality technology. … People shouldn’t be afraid of AI taking their job … they should be afraid of someone who’s really good at AI [and therefore more efficient] taking their job. So if we extend the question of “what are our top constraints on software?” to include not only hardware and power, the #3 long-term constraint is clear: We are chronically short of skilled human programmers. Humans are not being replaced en masse, not most of us; we are being made more productive, and we’re needed more than ever. As I wrote above: “Programming is a hot market, and programmers are in long-term high-growth demand.” [1] It’s actually great news that Big Tech is spending heavily on power, because the gigawatt capacity we build today is a long-term asset that will keep working for 15 to 20+ years, whether the companies that initially build that capacity survive or get absorbed. That’s important because it means all the power generation being built out today to satisfy demand in the current “AI bubble” will continue to be around when the next major demand for compute after AI comes along. See Ben Thompson’s great writing, such as “The Benefits of Bubbles” (Stratechery, November 2025). [2] The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy contains two opposite ideas, both fun but improbable: (1) The problem of being “too compute-constrained”: Deep Thought, the size of a city, wouldn’t really be allowed to run for 7.5 million years; you’d build a million cities. (2) The problem of having “too much excess compute capacity”: By the time a Marvin with a “brain the size of a planet” was built, he wouldn’t really be bored; we’d already be trying to solve problems the size of the solar system. [3] This is about “general-purpose” coding. Code at the leading specialized edges will always include use of custom DSLs. [4] This means that compiling plain C code (that is in the C/C++ intersection) as C++26 also automatically makes it more correct and more secure. This isn’t new; compiling C code as C++ and having the C code be more correct has been true since the 1980s. [5] If you’re my age, you remember when your teacher fretted that letting you use a calculator would harm your education. More of you remember similar angsting about letting students google the internet. Now we see the same fears with AI — as if we could stop it or any of those others even if we should. And we shouldn’t; each time, we re-learn the lesson that teaching students to use such tools should be part of their education because using tools makes us more productive. [6] This is not the same as Wirth’s Law, that “software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster.” Wirth’s observation was that the overheads of operating systems and higher-level runtimes and other costly abstractions were becoming ever heavier over time, so that a program to solve the same problem was getting more and more inefficient and soaking up more hardware capacity than it used to; for example, printing “Hello world” really does take far more power and hardware when written in modern Java than it did in Commodore 64 BASIC. That doesn’t apply to C++ which is not getting slower over time; C++ continues to be at least as efficient as low-level C for most uses. No, the key point I’m making here is very different: that the problems the software is tackling are growing faster than hardware is becoming faster.

Title: Is the US economy strong heading into 2026? The picture is complicated

The world’s largest economy is growing faster than its peers, but the divide between wealthy and poorer Americans is growing. Share Save As the United States economy heads into 2026, the report card emerging on its performance is complicated. By many measures, the world’s largest economy appears to be in a strong position. After a tumultuous year marked by President Donald Trump’s return to the White House and his swing towards tariffs and protectionism, recent growth has outpaced the expectations of most analysts. In a speech this month, Trump hailed his economic record, insisting that the US was on the cusp of an economic boom the “likes of which the world has never seen”. Yet nestled within the economic data are signs of weakness that hint at risks down the track. And crucially, Americans are widely pessimistic about their material condition. Here are some of the key metrics of the US economy as 2025 draws to a close: After a modest expansion in the first half of 2025, gross domestic product (GDP) growth blasted past expectations in the July-September quarter to reach an annualised 4.3 percent. That was the strongest performance in two years. It was also well ahead of the US’s fellow developed countries. During the third quarter, the eurozone’s and the United Kingdom’s economies grew just 2.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, on an annualised basis. Japan, the world’s fourth largest economy, contracted 2.3 percent during the period. While robust, the growth of the US economy has been largely driven by multibillion-dollar investments in artificial intelligence led by a handful of tech giants, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. By some estimates, AI-related spending accounted for about 40 percent of all growth in 2025. That means a lot rests on AI delivering on its as yet unproven potential to transform the economy. While many analysts believe AI will usher in a fourth industrial revolution, others are concerned the tech has been vastly overhyped. Campbell Harvey, an economist at Duke University, said 2026 could be the year that AI and decentralised financial technologies begin to deliver substantial gains to productivity. “We are at the cusp of technologies like AI being able to very substantially increase productivity,” Harvey told Al Jazeera. “This means higher growth. We have not seen realisations of this higher growth yet from AI.” While the US economy is strong on paper, Americans are broadly unhappy with the state of their finances. In fact, consumer sentiment is near record lows. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment stood at 53.3 in December, up slightly from the previous month, compared to 50 in June 2022 when inflation was at a four-decade high. Yet Americans are continuing to spend. Consumer spending grew 3.5 percent during the July-September quarter, the fastest pace since the final quarter of 2024. The splurge has shown no signs of slowing down either. Mastercard’s annual report on the Christmas season showed spending up 3.9 percent compared with last year. The reason for the disconnect between spending and sentiment? The diverging fortunes of wealthy Americans and those of more modest means. The top 10 percent of earners now account for roughly half of spending, the highest proportion since officials began compiling data in 1989, according to Moody’s Analytics. Harvey said he would give the economy an overall rating of six out of 10. “Many believe that the US is stuck in the 2 percent real GDP growth regime. The third quarter showed that higher growth is possible. I think many are too pessimistic. We need more ambition,” he said. Rolf J Langhammer, a researcher at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany, said he would rate the economy a six “at best”, noting that the International Monetary Fund had forecast a 2.7 percent growth rate at the start of Trump’s tenure. “The current strength is visibly lower, around 2 percent only,” Langhammer told Al Jazeera. After wild swings earlier in the year during Trump’s back-and-forth tariff announcements, stocks are finishing out 2025 on a high note. The benchmark S&P 500 is up nearly 18 percent, easily beating the average annual return of 10.5 percent. While most Americans own stocks, the gains have disproportionately benefitted wealthier households. Stock ownership ranges from as high as 87 percent in households earning at least $100,000 per year to as low as 28 percent of households earning less than $50,000, according to Gallup. Despite fears that Trump’s tariffs would fuel inflation, prices have grown at a moderate pace – though still above the US Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. Year-on-year inflation came to 2.7 percent in November, down from 3 percent in September. While inflation is way down from its recent peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022, when then-President Joe Biden faced a similarly glum public mood over the economy, Americans are still feeling the pinch. In a PBS News/NPR/Marist poll conducted this month, 70 percent of respondents said the cost of living in their area was unaffordable. Some economists have also cautioned that the full impact of tariffs may have been delayed by companies that stockpiled imports in anticipation of higher costs. Langhammer said the jury was out on whether living costs would remain stable in the coming year. “Front-loading of imports is fading out, and the effects of tariffs on inflation are likely to become more visible in 2026 in addition to the weak dollar,” Langhammer said, noting that the average effective tariff rate, 17 percent, was about five times higher than before Trump took office. However, Harvey said he believed the tariffs have had a minimal economic impact. “The US trade sector is very small compared to other countries. Measuring trade intensity as the sum of exports plus imports divided by GDP, the US ranks as one of the least trade-intensive countries in the world,” he said. “Another way of looking at this is to look at the size of imports relative to GDP, and you’ll see that it’s about 14 percent. This is why I believe that the economic impacts of tariffs are less important than the attention they get in the media.” Despite Trump’s pledge to restore the manufacturing glory of the US, unemployment has risen steadily since the start of his second term in January. The official jobless rate climbed to a four-year high of 4.6 percent in November, up from 4 percent in January. While Trump has attributed the rise to cuts in government jobs undertaken by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), those layoffs account for only a small proportion of the total number of jobless people. Whereas DOGE cut about 300,000 federal employees, one million more Americans were classified as unemployed in November compared with January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Title: ROOKE: The Somali Fraud Scandal Gave Trump A Kill Switch. What Happens If He Doesn’t Use It

Americans are demanding action. Anything less will lead to political chaos. “Long Live The King,” The New York Times wrote in February when President Donald Trump posted a picture of himself as Napoleon Bonaparte alongside a quote attributed to the French emperor, “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” It was this level of boldness to do the right thing for our country, no matter the costs, that led millions of Americans to vote for Trump’s second term. The Trump administration started strong. Americans wanted deportations, a rollback on every left-wing ideological policy implemented during the Biden years, and an all-out assault on government fraud and bloat that had become all too common in D.C. He took immediate action on the most critical issues voters mandated in the 2024 election. For a brief moment, it felt like the power we had given Trump and Republicans was paying off in Americans’ favor. Some even dared to say that we had finally gotten our country back. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!) But something happened over the summer. As left-wing judges blocked the Trump administration at every turn, refusing to let deportations continue, and Republicans in Congress failed to codify most of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts that were made, the momentum had shifted back to the bureaucratic blob. This is not to say that the Trump administration has stopped working on these issues, but the rapid-fire successes Americans saw in the first 100 days seemed to have come to an abrupt halt. Congressional Republicans resumed their backdoor dealing, ensuring that important voter wishes were dropped from legislation before it even reached the floor. Americans couldn’t afford to take their eye off of Congress even for a moment lest their elected representatives would secretly be selling their birthright off to BlackRock and Vanguard behind their backs. We don’t need to sell federal land and turn our wilderness into housing developments. If we need more housing, let’s round up all the illegals who don’t belong in this country and evict them. That’ll free up millions of housing units in one fell swoop. Leave the federal land… — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 20, 2025 Then Trump came out and called the face of government corruption – The Epstein List – a hoax. We saw that Democrats were trying to weaponize the human trafficker to own Trump. Still, there was an understanding that Trump would save this country no matter the cost. But Americans were told not to look at it. Attorney General Pam Bondi paraded influencers out with binders of useless pages that did nothing to bring any of the bad actors to justice. Still, we were told to trust the plan. The economic strains on Americans persisted as the summer months passed. Trump flew all around the world settling foreign wars for countries that wouldn’t hesitate to ignore our calls should something kick off here at home. While some of these trips were crucial to ensuring our national economic security, the optics of them, while Americans suffered back home, were less than helpful to his mission. And unless you were clued into the political world, it’s unlikely you saw these trips as anything but an administration focused more abroad than on its citizens. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s polling trended downwards. Americans wanted more relief, action, signs of life. Regardless of what it was, they expected to see more from this administration, which had promised an end to D.C. corruption. Instead, they got a government shutdown, brought on by the same slimy officials who have never hidden their contempt for their constituents. If there was ever a black pill forced down the throats of voters, watching this circus play out live was the ultimate one.

Instead, they complained about low-propensity voters and harped about New York City being a hotbed for socialism. However, the writing on the wall is clear: if Republicans don’t act now, there is nothing that will stop a midterm bloodbath, which will return their power to Democrats. However, hope has come in the most unlikely of places. Like Gandalf arriving at Helm’s Deep at first light on the fifth day, emerging from the east with Erkenbrand, rescuing the Rohirrim soldiers and turning the tide of the battle against Saruman’s forces, Somalis in Minnesota were caught defrauding billions in federal funds. Trump has been given the chance to turn back the last eleven months. The anger that even everyday Americans not clued into the political system feel toward the massive fraud uncovered in Minnesota provides almost unlimited leeway to get back to work. But real action has to be taken. MINNESOTA FRAUD: @NickShirleyyy’s work has helped show Americans the scale of fraud in Tim Walz’s Minnesota. @TheJusticeDept has been investigating this for months. So far, we have charged 98 individuals – 85 of Somali descent – and more than 60 have been found guilty in… — Attorney General Pamela Bondi (@AGPamBondi) December 29, 2025 It’s not enough for Bondi and other agencies and officials to post their supposed arrest and conviction stats as proof they are working when more and more fraud is being uncovered, not by them but by citizen journalists. Nothing less than massive arrests and deportations in every state will satisfy Americans looking for action. The focus shouldn’t just be on Somalis or other immigrant groups gaming the corrupt system. Elected officials and their bureaucratic allies need to be taken down with them. Trump needs to use the bully pulpit voters have given him. If Republicans are standing in the way of enacting the will of the people, call them out. Let the voters help take the obstinate D.C. swamp rats out with the trash. Americans want their country back. Kill the fraud. If the Trump administration and GOP Congressmen do not produce adequate results, why would voters ever give them power again? The Democrats will come in and ruin Trump’s legacy. Whatever work he has completed will be torn down, as if this past year never even happened.

Please let us know Topic:Financial Markets The value of Australian gold mining stocks skyrocketed in 2025. (Unsplash: Zlataky Cz) Interest rate cuts drove the Australian share market to its highest level ever in October 2025. Expectations of rate hikes in 2026 are driving the Australian dollar higher, though the ASX has fallen from its record. Market analysts expect shares of gold and AI stocks to continue doing well next year, though global markets may encounter more volatility from US President Donald Trump's unpredictable governing style. With 2025 almost over, now is perhaps as good a time as any to look back at where we could have invested our hard-earned money — but probably did not. Those who had the foresight (or luck) to buy mining stocks at the start of the year would have seen the value of those investments double, or even triple. Take, for example, Liontown Resources — a battery minerals company that reported a $193 million loss in the previous financial year. Despite its lacklustre financial performance, Liontown counts mining billionaire Gina Rinehart as its largest shareholder (with an almost 20 per cent stake through her company Hancock Prospecting). Gold miners dominate the list of best performing stocks in 2025. (Bloomberg, ABC News) The company has also inked lithium supply deals with Tesla, Ford and LG. And it received a $50 million investment from the federal government in August as part of its Future Made in Australia strategy to prop up certain industries in the national interest. It is no wonder the share price of this unprofitable, partly taxpayer-funded lithium miner has surged 180 per cent since January, making it one of the best performers on the Australian share market. Shares of its rivals Core Lithium (up 220 per cent), PLS (up 89 per cent) and IGO (up 65 per cent) have also enjoyed strong gains. The rally was also driven by a rebound in lithium prices (since crashing in 2023 on concerns about an oversupply of the battery mineral) and expectations of strong demand for electric vehicles in the years ahead, particularly in China. Another surprise was the sheer number of gold miners in the list of this year's best-performing stocks. They included Regis Resources, Genesis Minerals, Evolution Mining and Newmont Corporation. Shares of mining companies surged in 2025. (Bloomberg, ABC News) The value of their shares has roughly tripled in the past year as the price of physical gold has hit new record highs throughout the year, even climbing as high as $US4,532 an ounce last week. "What's driving the price higher in the last two years is mainly central banks buying gold as they move away from the US dollar and US dollar assets like Treasury bonds," said Gemma Dale, nabTrade's head of investor behaviour. Gold is seen as a safe-haven asset that tends to do well in times of global uncertainty. Financial commentators often cite US President Donald Trump's erratic policymaking and ever-changing tariff policies as reasons for gold's relatively recent popularity. Another concern is whether the Federal Reserve will continue to make interest rate decisions independently, free from the White House's interference, particularly given the US president's recent efforts to appoint rate-cutting loyalists. Gemma Dale expects President Trump to have less influence on the markets in 2026. (ABC News: John Gunn) On top of that, the Fed has already slashed America's interest rates three times in 2025 and is likely to keep cutting them next year, which has contributed to the US dollar losing 10 per cent of its value this year. So all this, along with concerns about US economic exceptionalism and geopolitical conflict, has led to huge demand for bullion, which in turn has led to the share prices of many Australian gold mining companies rising to their most expensive levels ever. Overall, the local share market has done reasonably well, with the ASX 200 up 10 per cent (when dividends are included), and the broader All Ordinaries index gaining 7 per cent. But for those who bought into the Australian market in early April, after Mr Trump caused a global crash with his so-called liberation day tariff, and sold at a record high in late October, their gains would be much higher at about 24 per cent. When asked to describe 2025, the words "volatility" and "stress" were what came to mind for Ten Cap's lead portfolio manager and stock picker, Jun Bei Liu. Jun Bei Liu expects 2026 to be a volatile year for markets. (ABC News: John Gunn) She said: "No-one expected Trump to be negotiating tariffs so openly, which has been the cause of all this volatility on the markets" — as evidenced by the extreme swings in share prices (up and down) that have regularly occurred throughout the year. Ms Dale also found 2025 to be quite a stressful year for share investing. "We had so much concern about what the implications of those particular tariff announcements were going to be, and whether there'd potentially be a catastrophic collapse in global trade, something like we saw during COVID," Ms Dale said. Donald Trump with his 'reciprocal tariffs' chart on April 3, 2025. (Reuters: Carlos Barria) "As those fears failed to materialise … everyone jumped on the TACO trade." TACO is an acronym that stands for "Trump always chickens out", and is used by traders to describe the US president's tendency to make grand tariff threats that cause investor panic — only for him to then backflip to some degree, giving time for markets to rebound. The TACO trade — which is essentially the belief that markets will recover after Mr Trump's initial shocking announcements — has helped push many countries' share markets to their highest levels ever. However, the ASX appears to have underperformed against its overseas peers, particularly Wall Street's S&P 500 (up 18 per cent), Japan's Nikkei (up 28 per cent) and South Korea's KOSPI (up by a whopping 76 per cent). The price of gold has hit another record and is set to become Australia's second most valuable resource export after iron ore. Unlike those nations, Australia's technology sector is much smaller, making up only 3 per cent of the local share market's value. So the ASX has not benefited as much from the artificial intelligence (AI) investment boom, which has led to the share price of Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Tesla ("the Magnificent Seven"), as well as the broader US stock market, soaring to new heights. Another difference is that those foreign stock markets belong to countries that have seen significant falls in their exchange rates because they are likely to be recipients of further stimulus in 2026 (whether it is interest rate cuts or massive government spending). In contrast, Australia is more likely to see interest rates rise next year due to the return of higher inflation, which is expected to stick around for longer than what the RBA is comfortable with. The Australian market had much smaller gains than its overseas peers. (Refinitiv, ABC News) As a general rule, lower interest rates (and cheaper borrowing costs) usually lead to stock markets rising as investors pile into riskier, speculative investments — and feel more comfortable overpaying for stocks. Rate hikes, on the other hand, tend to have the opposite effect (that is, investors "selling down" and taking profits as the cost of money becomes more expensive). Concerns about the share market (or certain companies and sectors) being overvalued have grown louder over the past year. Commonwealth Bank, for instance, has developed a reputation for being the most expensive bank in the world, especially when judged by its price-to-earnings ratio (basically, the amount of money people are willing to pay for each dollar of profit it earns). After hitting a record high of $191.40 in June, CBA's share price has undergone a major correction, having dropped 16 per cent in six months. The ASX 200 crashed in April, then scaled a new record high within months. (Refinitiv) Worries about the market being too expensive have also led to the collective value of the ASX's technology and healthcare stocks falling by more than 20 per cent this year. Indeed, tech and health care are the worst-performing sectors on the local share market — largely due to steep falls in the share price of biotech giant CSL (-39 per cent), bookkeeping software firm Xero (-33 per cent) and logistics software company WiseTech Global (-45 per cent). WiseTech, meanwhile, has also taken a hit from personal scandals involving its founder Richard White, which led to him being forced to step down as CEO — though he has since taken up the executive chairman role. The tech and healthcare sectors had the steepest falls in 2025. (Refinitiv, ABC News) She does, however, expect companies like NextDC and Goodman Group, both AI data centre owners, to earn strong profits next year, which will support their share price. Ms Liu expects "resources [stocks] should continue to do well, led by copper and gold prices". "Airlines should do better because oil prices are reasonably low and some of the 'oversold' tech companies could make a comeback," Ms Liu said. This year saw economies survive tariff shocks and markets burst through record highs, but it doesn't feel like a party because so many people aren't invited. "I think the share market will do OK next year and should deliver a return between 8 and 10 per cent. That's pretty much an average year." "We expect there'll still be volatility because we still haven't got the final outcome for the China and US tariffs. All we've got from both sides is just a framework." Although Mr Trump's unpredictability had a significant impact on markets this year, Ms Dale believes he will have far less influence in 2026. "The markets don't believe him anymore," she said. "They believe that everything he does is a negotiating tactic, so it's no longer credible. So he can make these big dramatic announcements and they won't be market-moving anymore." "And I think that's a really interesting outcome because people trust that he will back down. Trump has flooded the airwaves to the point where the market is just a little bit more relaxed. "At this point, 2026 looks like it could be a solid, boring kind of year with the major sectors holding up OK, but not sensational levels of growth."

Title: XRP ETFs Pull In $1.3B in 50 Days—What the Data Suggests if Flows Reach $5B

Time Published: 2025-12-30T19:32:36Z
Full Content:
Investing XRP ETFs absorbed $1.3B in 50 days and locked 746M XRP (1.14% of circulating supply) with only one zero-inflow day since launch. At $27.7M daily inflows XRP ETFs reach $5B by mid-May 2026. That would lock 2.6B XRP or 4% of circulating supply. Exchange balances fell 58% in 2025 to 1.7B XRP. Combined with ETF lockup this removes significant liquidity from active trading. Sending You to Google News in 3 © CL STOCK / Shutterstock.com In just 50 days since launch, XRP ETFs pulled in $1.3 billion with 43 consecutive trading days of positive inflows—the first and only zero-inflow day occurred on December 26, 2025. That pace ranks XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) among the fastest institutional adoption curves outside Bitcoin. Institutional capital entered steadily even while XRP’s price fell 50% from its July 2025 peak of $3.56, and the broader crypto markets struggled through December’s volatility. With inflows averaging $27.7 million daily and 746 million XRP now locked in ETF custody, the question becomes structural: What happens to supply, liquidity, and market depth if XRP ETF flows reach $5 billion? FAMILY STOCK / Shutterstock.com In 50 days, XRP ETFs absorbed $1.3 billion while locking 746 million XRP—roughly 1.14% of the 65.5 billion circulating supply—with virtually zero redemptions through late December. The pace shows how quickly institutional capital can tighten supply before prices respond. Here’s how issuers performed. Canary Capital defined the market early. XRPC launched on November 13 and pulled in $250 million on day one. The fund now holds approximately $384 million, roughly 30% of total XRP ETF assets. That share stayed stable despite cheaper competitors entering the market, showing institutions favored liquidity and early access over low fees. Daily inflows often exceeded $100 million outside headline events, signaling durable allocation rather than event-driven trading. Canary’s book reflects committed institutional demand building positions over weeks. Grayscale’s strength came from existing relationships. Assets from its XRP Trust rolled directly into GXRP at launch, creating instant scale without requiring new capital commitments. The fund now manages more than $220 million, and that capital has proven sticky—investors didn’t rotate out after launch-week excitement faded. The conversion structure reduced friction for allocators who wanted regulated exposure without operational changes to custody arrangements. GXRP’s steady flows demonstrate how institutional familiarity still matters in ETF adoption, even when competitors offer lower fees. Franklin took a different approach. XRPZ launched with a 0.19% expense ratio—the lowest in the category—and raised over $190 million. Adoption has been measured rather than explosive, which fits its target audience. As annual portfolio reviews roll through advisory practices in Q1 2026, Franklin’s market share may rise as cost-conscious allocators shift from higher-fee competitors. These quieter flows still contribute meaningfully to tightening available XRP supply, even if they don’t generate daily headline volume. Bitwise attracts active trading desks that rebalance frequently, resulting in uneven but persistent inflows as institutions adjust crypto exposure tactically. 21Shares extends reach through international distribution channels, particularly in Europe where cross-border ETF access matters for multi-jurisdiction allocators. Joyseulay / Shutterstock.com At the current pace, XRP ETF inflows show steady institutional commitment rather than speculative bursts. With roughly $27.7 million entering daily on average over 50 days, assets continue climbing on a predictable trajectory driven by consistent allocation rather than momentum trading. Maintaining this velocity places the $5 billion milestone approximately 130 days away from current levels, pointing to mid-May 2026. Hitting that threshold would lock an estimated 2.6 billion XRP into ETF custody—representing roughly 4% of the 65.5 billion circulating supply. That’s a fourfold increase from current 1.14% lockup levels. That accumulation compounds existing supply removal happening outside ETFs. Exchange balances fell dramatically throughout 2025, dropping from approximately 4 billion XRP at year-start to just 1.6-1.7 billion by late December—a 58% decline. While ETFs absorbed 746 million of that withdrawal, the remaining 1.5+ billion XRP moved into private custody wallets, institutional cold storage, and long-term holder addresses, showing accumulation extending well beyond regulated products. XRP’s supply is fixed at 65.5 billion in circulation, so tokens placed in regulated custody don’t return to active trading unless investors redeem ETF shares. If institutional positions remain in place for quarters rather than weeks, liquidity tightens through structure rather than sentiment, fundamentally reshaping market depth and available float over time regardless of short-term price moves. TopMicrobialStock / Shutterstock.com ETF inflows rarely move in straight lines. Three forces could push XRP funds past the $5 billion mark faster than the current 130-day projection. BlackRock’s absence remains the largest variable in XRP’s ETF growth trajectory. The firm’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) attracted over $40 billion in assets within its first year, demonstrating BlackRock’s unmatched ability to mobilize institutional capital at scale through its Aladdin platform connections and relationships with thousands of wealth advisors. The firm tends to wait for regulatory clarity rather than chase first-mover advantage. Once confident in the legal framework, BlackRock moves decisively. A late XRP ETF filing from BlackRock would carry enormous weight with allocators—many institutions wait for BlackRock’s entry as implicit validation. Based on IBIT’s trajectory, a BlackRock XRP ETF could potentially bring $1-2 billion in launch-month inflows alone, compressing timelines dramatically. As Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin expands across blockchains and into lending markets—currently at approximately $1.3 billion market cap—XRP gains functional relevance beyond passive custody. RLUSD settlement on XRP Ledger creates organic demand for XRP as a bridge currency and fee-payment mechanism. Utility-backed flows tend to be stickier than speculative positioning. If RLUSD scales to $5-10 billion and begins facilitating significant cross-border settlement volume through ODL corridors, the narrative around XRP shifts from “crypto asset” to “payments infrastructure token.” XRP ETF inflows held remarkably steady despite Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs facing significant outflows during the same November-December period. If Bitcoin reclaims $100,000+ and sustains that level through Q1 2026, ETFs across all crypto assets often see second-wave institutional demand. A healthier macro backdrop could lift daily XRP ETF subscriptions well above the current $27.7 million average. XRP ETF inflows have fundamentally shifted the conversation from price speculation to structural market changes. Sustained allocations totaling $1.3 billion over 50 days, 746 million XRP locked away from trading circulation, and disciplined institutional behavior through volatile December conditions all point to a market changing quietly beneath range-bound price action. The path to $5 billion isn’t guaranteed—macro shocks, prolonged underperformance, or capital fragmentation could derail the current trajectory. But the path is measurable and predictable if current conditions hold. At $27.7 million daily, XRP ETFs reach $5 billion by mid-May 2026, locking 4% of circulating supply into regulated custody. From a technical standpoint, XRP consolidating between $1.85-$2.00 while ETF accumulation continues supports the supply squeeze thesis building over months. A decisive breakout above $2.20 with expanding volume would signal the structural changes are beginning to impact price discovery. If $5 billion hits with XRP trading above $2.50, the combination of reduced available float and improving sentiment could accelerate moves toward $3-4 as patient institutional positioning meets returning retail demand.

Wealth quote of the day by Bill Ackman: “Investing is one of the few businesses where you can do everything right and still lose money in the short term. What matters is a strategy that works long term—and the discipline to ignore the noise.” Bill Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, is a name synonymous with high-stakes Wall Street drama. Ackman has spent decades perfecting a strategy known as activist investing. Unlike traditional investors who buy and sell quietly, Ackman takes massive, concentrated stakes in companies and publicly demands structural changes to unlock value.

Title: Looking Back at 2025 – I Really Have to Just Focus on the Highs Again

Once again on the path out of 2025 continues with what is sometimes my final reflective post to be written during the year. The Year is 2025 There is, at this point, a long tradition of such posts here at TAGN. If you are sufficiently bored, you can indulge yourself with the musings of past years: Usually I do highs and lows. Once in a while I try highs, lows, and in between. Those are rare years. And then there are years where the lows will grind you down if you spend too much time dwelling on them, so I just have to zero in on the good things. 2024 was like that, and 2025 even more so. For years like those I have to just leave behind all the layoffs, cancellations, studio closures, corporate greed, transparent bonus chasing, lies, betrayals, and any AI related stupidity… which is 99% of the pro-AI discourse… and focus on what went right. Or at least I have to try. I cannot be held responsible for any backhanded compliments or sarcasm you may perceive. I am only human, and can only play along with so much greed and stupidity before I start using “fuck” as a modifier in every other sentence. So here we go. CCP Enad Global 7 Other MMO and Online Game Things Other Video Game Items Blogs, Social Media, Media, and Online Life That is what springs to mind in my stream of consciousness. What else good happened? 2026 It is coming. We cannot stop it. We will have to see what it brings and what we can make from that. Thanks for reminding me I really need to watch KPop Demon Hunters. I’m always late to the zeitgeist. I only just watched the first season of Arcane and I haven’t gotten to Fallout yet. I am up to speed on Stranger Things, though. Out of curiosity, other than Snoop Dogg, what’s AI about Luna? I thought it was just the same as GeForce Now only you get it bundled with Prime. Then again, I haven’t actually used it yet… LikeLike Their intro to Luna had Snoop Dogg as the inaugural entry with a promise of more AI powered titles promised, so there was an least the implication that they are going to keep pressing the “AI” button. Then again, I am starting to see some companies and pundits lauding AI in applications where it would more correctly be called “software.” So we’re getting both people predicting a perfect AI nirvana world and others trying to jump on the bandwagon by just calling all software that does any analysis of data input “AI” as opportunistic branding. LikeLike So it goes… Thanks for keeping this going. Having another average curmudgeon to sympathize with every day keeps me grounded. Good things worth mentioning… Watching Kimmel stick it to the man (and the mouse) was, at least in the end, very enjoyable. Sinners – if you haven’t seen it, see it. LikeLike I liked Sinners. My problem was that people I know who love horror could not stop saying how great it was… and it wasn’t all that. Not for me at least. But that is always a problem, when something gets built up too much based on hype. The thing with Kimmel is that it came in the context of an awful government pressuring our billionaire overlords to stifle dissent. I applaud Kimmel, but the context of the situation is still very very bad. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

City Comptroller Brad Lander had proposed the moves, alleging the firms have failed to meet the funds’ net zero plans. The trustees of New York City’s five pension funds have shelved recommendations from outgoing New York City Comptroller Brad Lander to rebid BlackRock’s U.S. public equities index mandate and to terminate agreements with Fidelity due to allegedly “inadequate” decarbonization plans. “While I am disappointed in the decision of NYCERS’ trustees to table my recommendation to rebid BlackRock’s mandate today, I hope the trustees will vote to adopt it in the new year, as Comptroller-Elect Mark Levine takes office,” Lander said in a statement issued on December 17. Lander noted that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote in a 2020 letter to CEOs that “climate risk is investment risk” and that the firm was shifting its investment strategy to focus on climate-related investing. “Unfortunately, BlackRock in 2025 is failing to act like it,” Lander said regarding Fink’s position. “BlackRock has chosen to backtrack on their commitments and they now refuse to conduct proxy engagement with companies where they own a significant share of the stock.” Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  Lander, whose term as comptroller will end on January 1, 2026, made his recommendation—after updating the city’s Net Zero Implementation Plan—for three of the five pension funds: the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, the Teachers’ Retirement System of the City of New York and the New York City Board of Education Retirement System. Lander said the recommendations were based on a “rigorous evaluation.” BlackRock’s mandate is set to expire at the end of 2026. When Lander made his recommendation in November, he included agreements with PanAgora Asset Management as ones to be reconsidered. According to his latest announcement, he considers those agreements appropriate to continue, after PanAgora submitted an amended net zero plan that included additional information about its engagement with portfolio companies to encourage them to adopt net zero plans. In response to Lander’s accusations, BlackRock’s Head of the Americas Institutional Business Armando Senra published a letter to Lander accusing him of politicizing the city’s pension funds and stating that altering any of the funds’ portfolios would have to undergo a review process involving the plans’ board and the New York City Bureau of Asset Management investment team. The Bureau of Asset Management, part of the comptroller’s office, is responsible for overseeing the investment portfolios of the city’s public pension systems. According to Senra’s letter, the world’s largest asset manager has had multiple conversations with the bureau’s investment team concerning investment and decarbonization plans over the past several months and met with the funds’ investment team in November to provide an update on BlackRock’s climate and decarbonization stewardship program. “During that meeting, we informed the investment team that a version of this program is now available to each of the five pension plans,” Senra wrote. Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a nonpartisan business advocacy group, said in a statement that Lander’s recommendation is “unilateral and incomprehensible.” “[BlackRock] is a key member of the Partnership for New York City and is well known for its global leadership on sustainability and environmental issue,” Wylde said in the statement. “It is our hope that the pragmatic interests of the city and our public pension funds will prevail over political theater under incoming Comptroller[-Elect] Mark Levine.” Fidelity did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Title: Galaxy Digital: 2026 Too Volatile to Call, but $250K Bitcoin by 2027 Remains Plausible

Investing Galaxy Digital sees Bitcoin too chaotic to forecast for 2026 but maintains a $250K target by 2027. Bitcoin is projected to range between $70K-$130K by mid-2026. This reflects macro uncertainty, Fed policy swings, and political risk rather than clean cycle patterns. ETF infrastructure permanently changed Bitcoin demand dynamics. BlackRock IBIT holds $71B+ and Vanguard opened its platform to 50M clients in December 2025, creating a standing institutional bid that survives even during $497M weekly outflows. Sending You to Google News in 3 © aleks333 / Shutterstock.com Galaxy Digital is taking an unusually candid stance on Bitcoin’s (CRYPTO: BTC) next phase. According to Alex Thorn, the firm’s head of research, Galaxy sees Bitcoin’s 2026 price too chaotic to forecast confidently, even as longer-term conviction remains intact. Galaxy’s comments reflect a market shaped by macro policy swings, political risk, and shifting institutional behavior rather than the clean four-year cycle patterns that defined previous bull runs. Here’s the problem: the Federal Reserve might cut rates 2-3 times or hold steady depending on inflation. Trump administration pro-crypto policies might execute quickly or stall in Congress. Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks means macro data—jobs reports, GDP prints, inflation readings—now drives price more than crypto-specific news. That creates genuine uncertainty where Bitcoin could reasonably land anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000 by mid-2026. Yet beneath that near-term chaos, Galaxy argues that structural adoption continues building. ETFs, corporate balance sheets, and pension frameworks are permanently reshaping institutional capital engagement. That divide explains why short-term forecasts look chaotic while Galaxy’s Bitcoin $250K 2027 target remains firmly on the table. RoseLife_Family / Shutterstock.com Galaxy sees three factors making Bitcoin 2026 unpredictable: Fed rate cuts colliding with stubborn inflation, policy execution risk with midterms approaching, and Bitcoin’s equity correlation tying price to macro data rather than crypto fundamentals. Macro uncertainty sits at the center of Galaxy’s 2026 forecasting problem. The Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts—the market expects 2-3 cuts bringing rates from 4.5% toward 3.5-4%—yet inflation hovering near 3% limits flexibility. The Fed’s 2% target remains out of reach, creating tension between easing policy and controlling prices. Labor data and recession odds remain fluid, keeping policy expectations unstable. Strong jobs reports could delay cuts, while weak GDP prints could accelerate them. This makes it impossible to confidently project where Bitcoin lands because its performance has become increasingly tied to broader financial conditions. The Trump administration’s pro-crypto direction has improved sentiment—Paul Atkins at the SEC, Michael Selig at the CFTC, the GENIUS Act signed in July—but execution risk remains high. Legislation like the Clarity Act could pass the Senate in Q1 2026 or stall for months in committee debates. Trade policy, fiscal spending, and election dynamics—midterms hit in November 2026—could shift liquidity faster than markets can price in. When policy timelines are uncertain and political outcomes unclear, forecasting asset prices 12 months out becomes guesswork. Bitcoin’s correlation with equities climbed sharply over 2024-2025. Bitcoin now often moves in sync with the Nasdaq and S&P 500, tying performance to broad risk appetite rather than the original “digital gold” scarcity narrative. When stocks fall on recession fears, Bitcoin typically falls harder, and when stocks rally on Fed dovishness, Bitcoin follows—a strong jobs report can send Bitcoin up 5% in a day, while a weak GDP print can drop it by 8% as investors flee to bonds and cash. Mer_Studio / Shutterstock.com Galaxy’s long-term case separates short-term noise from structural change. While 2026 remains too chaotic to forecast, durable adoption trends still support a $250,000 scenario by the end of 2027. Spot Bitcoin ETFs created a standing institutional bid that didn’t exist in prior cycles. BlackRock’s IBIT alone gathered over $71 billion, proving regulated access unlocked deep pools of capital. Even during weeks with $497 million in outflows, the infrastructure stayed open. Vanguard’s expansion of ETF access to its 50 million clients in December 2025 reinforces these are permanent channels. Corporate adoption has moved beyond experimental allocations. Strategy’s holdings of over 670,000 BTC—worth roughly $59 billion at $88,000—reshaped how public company balance sheets treat Bitcoin. More than 160 public companies now follow similar frameworks. With projected corporate holdings potentially nearing one million BTC by late 2026, supply dynamics tighten. FASB’s fair-value accounting shift in late 2024 removed a key barrier—companies can now mark Bitcoin to market value each quarter. Pension exposure remains small—most allocations are 0.5-2% of portfolio value—but direction matters more than magnitude. Wisconsin, Michigan, and UK pension allocations signal acceptance within conservative mandates. Even 1% positions matter when portfolios are measured in trillions. A 1% allocation from a $500 billion pension fund is $5 billion—more than most retail waves. These decisions take years to reverse once governance boards approve them. Galaxy frames $250,000 as conditional, not guaranteed. Bitcoin’s role alongside gold as a hedge against currency debasement—protection against deficit spending and money printing—strengthens the case. If rates trend toward 3% by 2027 and institutions keep accumulating through ETFs and treasuries, supply-demand math shifts quickly. With 19.8 million Bitcoin in circulation and potentially 2-3 million locked in long-term institutional custody (ETFs, corporate treasuries, lost coins), the available supply for sale shrinks. That asymmetry—growing demand meeting shrinking supply—creates upside potential that compounds over time. Galaxy’s framework is straightforward: 2026 is a coin flip between conflicting forces, but 2027’s direction is clearer. Whether Bitcoin reaches $130,000 or retests $70,000 in 2026 depends entirely on variables no one controls—Fed rate decisions responding to inflation data that hasn’t printed yet, Clarity Act timing in a Senate facing midterm pressures, and whether recession fears materialize or fade. But here’s what doesn’t change regardless of 2026’s path: BlackRock’s $71 billion IBIT isn’t disappearing. Strategy’s 670,000 BTC isn’t getting sold. Pension boards in Wisconsin and Michigan that approved allocations aren’t reversing decisions. These structural shifts create a floor that wasn’t there in previous cycles. That’s why Galaxy maintains $250K by 2027 despite calling 2026 too chaotic to forecast. When demand keeps growing from permanent institutional infrastructure while available supply keeps shrinking, the direction becomes clear even if the timing stays messy. Galaxy’s betting that 18 months is enough time for macro conditions to resolve while structural forces compound. The 2026 range might be wide, but the 2027 trajectory is narrowing.

Title: 3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy if You Want to Outperform Next Year

Investing Micron Technology (MU) is exiting the consumer market to focus on enterprise clients. Micron gained 226% year-to-date as RAM prices soared from data center demand. Western Digital (WDC) surged 288% year-to-date on storage demand for AI training. The stock trades at 23x forward earnings with 58% expected EPS growth in FY 2026. ACM Research (ACMR) trades at a $2.64B market cap while its 74.6% stake in the Shanghai arm is worth $9.1B. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Cherdchai101 / Shutterstock.com The past year has been a continuation of an unceasing tech rally, one that may continue well into 2026 and beyond. If you are a strong believer in that, looking into Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) can help you outperform the broader market significantly. All three are riding the AI megatrend and have strong revenue visibility beyond 2026. These companies are on the “frontline” when it comes to AI hardware. Data centers are being built out at a record pace, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is not the only company that is benefiting from it. The market is starting to move past NVDA stock and is pouring into other satellite AI beneficiaries who are seeing explosive upward momentum one after the other. Let’s take a look at why the following three can win big next year. If you’ve built a PC anytime soon, you’ll know that random-access memory (RAM) prices have been soaring. Certain RAM chips have seen their prices quintuple or more in a matter of weeks. This is thanks to stubborn demand from data centers outpacing supply. One would logically say: how can I benefit from this instead of losing out like every other consumer? Micron is a medium to do just that. This company sells semiconductors like DRAM, RAM, NAND flash, SSDs, and similar items that are seeing record demand from data centers. It is seeing demand so strong that the company’s management has decided to exit the consumer market and is now focusing on enterprise clients. I believe this will increase margins significantly, as the consumer market has lower margins. Companies are willing to pay far more, especially at a time when it is becoming harder to secure supplies for data centers. Every hyperscaler is rushing to build as much as possible, and Micron is well-positioned to benefit from that. Analysts expect the RAM market to remain tight through 2026, possibly stretching into 2027 or even 2028. Thus, I see MU stock outperforming in 2026. It has delivered over 226% in year-to-date 2025 gains (as of writing). Western Digital is in a similar market, but it supplies another crucial component that data centers need. It focuses on hard drives and solid-state drives. If you use a computer, you certainly have those components being used, and data centers are putting them into use even more aggressively. AI training needs petabytes (thousands of terabytes) of data. The amount of data needed is only increasing as the AI battle heats up. It’s not just text AI that is being trained by companies now. Image AI models and video AI models need even more data, as they often train on 4K videos. The meteoric increase in demand has translated into the stock price exploding by over 288% year-to-date. You’re still paying just 23 times forward earnings for FY 2026 (ends in June 2026). I expect a lot more upside as FY 2026 EPS growth is expected at 58%. It may prove to be an underestimate if data center demand again proves to be sticky. ACM Research makes equipment for semiconductor fabrication, particularly wet cleaning systems (SAPS, Tahoe) and electroplating (ECP) tools. This is a U.S.-based company, but the twist is that it owns a much larger Chinese company called ACM Research (Shanghai), Inc. That Chinese arm is worth $12.2 billion, of which 74.6% is owned by ACM Research. This equals $9.1 billion, well over the $2.64 billion market capitalization on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This discrepancy was called out by Kerrisdale Capital in January of this year, where ACMR stock was called a “10-Bagger”. ACMR stock is up over 132% since then, and I believe it can go much higher. Financials are still excellent, and the Chinese arm maintains market dominance. The company can also skirt geopolitical tensions (as it has done recently) due to the Chinese arm being separate. Analysts expect nearly 16% revenue growth for all of 2025 and 18.3% revenue growth next year. You’re paying less than 20 times forward earnings for the stock, though that is irrelevant considering the large discrepancy between the Shanghai arm and the U.S.-traded entity makes it a bargain-basement buy.

We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 earlier this month.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." Earlier this month, we learned that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment firm MGX would each take a 15% stake in TikTok, but ByteDance would still retain about 20%. For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it? Carr wasn't willing to concede any mistakes during a recent Senate hearing.—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 earlier this month.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." Earlier this month, we learned that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment firm MGX would each take a 15% stake in TikTok, but ByteDance would still retain about 20%. For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer.

More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." Earlier this month, we learned that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment firm MGX would each take a 15% stake in TikTok, but ByteDance would still retain about 20%. For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it? Carr wasn't willing to concede any mistakes during a recent Senate hearing.—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham PCMag.com is a leading authority on technology, delivering lab-based, independent reviews of the latest products and services.

Title: Tech Trainwrecks: The Biggest Fails of 2025

We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 earlier this month.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning.

It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

Title: My Top 10 Learnings from 37 Podcasts with Harry Stebbings and Rory O’Driscoll This Year

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts Harry Stebbings. Rory ODriscoll and I have done 37 podcasts together this year (!). We didn’t miss a week. But man, the world changed in those 37 weeks. My top learnings… and what’s changed: I know this can be triggering, and I know it sounds unfair and wrong. But the rate at which the best AI + B2B startups can scale today is utterly unprecedented. It’s not just the ones you know. Higgsfield is growing at rates I’ve never seen coming up on $200m run-rate in < 12 months. It’s not just Replit and Lovable and Cursor. It’s amazing there are 20+ others you’ve never even heard of getting to $100m ARR in 12-18 months now. Vertical B2B + AI leaders like @owner accelerating at scale. You just have to find those ones. We’re just getting started. It’s not just startups. Leaders like Salesforce will be almost nothing like they were before, when most of their functions are run by agents. These “AI Agents” in B2B really didn’t work for the first half of 2025. They didn’t. They got better with Claude 3.7, better with Claude 4, and I think, even better with Claude 4.5. @Replit got truly great only with Agent v3 just a few months ago. Today? My agents talk to other agents, debate features, and run almost infinitely. And that’s just the change in the last 90 days. The rate of change here is difficult to see, but it is epic. AI Agents really will work in 2026 in B2B in a way they were mostly experiments in 2025. The difference between the leaders in B2B this year, and the ones that struggled? The ones that ended the year with stock prices up +40%, vs. -25%? They really tapped into AI Tailwinds. Not just claiming they added AI to their products. This sounds obvious today, but it wasn’t 100% clear when we started the pod. Cloud is “dead”. “SaaS” is dead. But B2B AI is attracting more budget than ever before. AI Cloud, AI SaaS, AI B2B, AI datacenter. Per Gartner, total enterprise software spending is accelerating faster than ever before. Go get that budget. I’m now “Replit Fluent.” 9 apps in production. 780,000+ uses already. 6 months ago I couldn’t finish my first project. 10 months ago this would have been impossible. Now I can will almost anything I want to build for the SaaStr community into production — the only limit is time. The learning curve in AI is real, but if you push through, it’s a superpower you never had before. 2,221 CEOs quit last year (up 24%). But — this is not the time or age of professional CEOs. Stay. Founders, stay. The rate of change in the Age of AI is just too fast. Your startup (or large company) will fail or fall far behind if founders aren’t at the helm. Not always, but almost always. Co-pilots were the great failure story of 2025. They didn’t add enough value to justify the pricing. But Gamma, ElevenLabs, Palantir, Replit, Cursor all showed there is massive budget if the ROI is huge and often, near instant. The math has changed: mega-funds like a]16z ($20B) and Founders Fund ($4.6B) can just write one big check into a winner. Why struggle for 8x over 20 years on a seed fund when you can stuff $1B into Databricks at the right price? Thrive’s strategy: “Buy the best property on every block — like Monopoly.” The numbers are almost hard to believe: Nvidia: 80% of employees are now millionaires. 50% have a net worth exceeding $25 million. Wealth creation at a scale we’ve never seen in tech history. Cursor: $29.3 billion valuation. $1B+ ARR. With roughly 300 employees. That’s $100M+ in enterprise value per employee. Scale AI: Alexandr Wang became the world’s youngest self-made billionaire at 24. Meta paid $14.3 billion for a 49% stake — just to get him and a handful of top AI engineers. Wang’s net worth: $3.6 billion at age 28. This was all almost brand new in 2025, the massive price for talent. The AI wealth creation machine is producing outcomes we’ve never seen before. The transformation is staggering: AI now captures half of all global venture funding. But more importantly, half of it is all going into very late stage growth deals. And that % isn’t going up. Venture $$$ are way up, back to 2021 pace, but into more and more specific, ultra-high growth, often late stage opportunities. And the pace of valuation acceleration is breathtaking: Meanwhile, traditional B2B? Mega-rounds ($100M+) collapsed from 147 deals in 2021 to just 21 in the 12 months through mid-2025. The money didn’t disappear. It just moved — all to AI. If you’re not building AI-native, you’re competing for a rapidly shrinking pool of capital. 37 podcasts. One year. And honestly? I feel like we captured a moment in time that will define the next decade of B2B software. The rules changed. The playbooks changed. The math changed. T3D2 is dead. Co-pilots failed. Founders need to stay. Agents are real. And the wealth creation is unlike anything we’ve ever seen. 2026 is going to be even wilder. See you on the pod.

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. It's been a wild year for tech innovation, and last January we previewed many of its most compelling new products at the Las Vegas Convention Center. As always, we searched the halls and rooms far and wide to examine cutting-edge gadgets and prototypes from more than 4,000 companies. To wrap up the show, we brought you our definitive list of the Best Tech of CES 2025—the 21 products that delighted us the most, and seemed destined to influence the rest of the industry in the months and years to come. CES is once again just a few days away, and we're all set to fly to Las Vegas. (Indeed, our joint digital media division, CNET Group, is choosing the official CES 2026 best-in-show winners, in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association.) But before we pack our bags, we asked our experts to look back at the best innovations they picked from last year's show. We wanted answers to the most critical questions: What were our choices like in the real world as actual production models? Did they measure up when we tested them, or did they disappoint? Did they even come out at all? Here's what our experts discovered. When we first saw the Asus Zenbook A14, we were impressed by its slim, lightweight design, distinctive magnesium-alloy construction and Ceraluminum design, and long-lasting battery—enough to name it the best laptop of CES 2025. When we reviewed it in May, I was still wowed by all of those details, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus was a bit underwhelming, even for a Copilot+ PC. But even with low test scores, the Zenbook A14 still earned a 4-star rating as an excellent ultraportable system. It may not have won an Editors' Choice award, but it's currently listed as both the Best Windows Ultraportable Laptop Under $1,000 and the Best Budget OLED Laptop, making it a smart buy for many.—Brian Westover We first got a look at the (confusingly named) Vision X AI 2nd at Computex 2024, before seeing it again in a more developed state at CES. It's a sizable and powerful gaming desktop in its own right, but its calling card is a 13-inch touch display on the front panel. This full HD panel can be used to show system diagnostics, apps, or even as a second monitor. The "AI" and "2nd" in its name refer to the NPU-bearing Arrow Lake 200 processors inside, while top-end Nvidia GPUs power gaming and graphics workloads. The main update about how this fared in 2025? It finally went on sale as a finished product, though stock is limited and configurations cost many thousands of dollars. (MSI is currently selling one model on its website for $5,499). We didn't review it ourselves yet, but it is now available for interested enthusiasts. —Matt Buzzi The Lenovo Legion Go S is a system full of potential, but when I finally got my hands on the Windows 11-powered handheld, its gaming performance ultimately let me down. The AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor proved too underpowered to deliver substantial gains over its predecessor and inherited much of its predecessor's clunkiness. However, Lenovo rectified most of the system’s flaws with the release of a SteamOS variant. With Windows 11 out of the picture, games performed far better than they did on the Windows-powered Go S, and it’s our recommendation for Steam Deck users looking to upgrade their system. —Zackery Cuevas MSI’s Project Zero X was an experimental “what next?” iteration on the company’s Project Zero, an initiative for PC building that enables super-minimalist, clean-looking desktop PCs. Project Zero uses motherboards with connectors on the underside of the PCB to let you hide all the PC’s internal cables behind the board. CES 2025’s Project Zero X took that to another level, with the whole board front covered in fancy heat sinks and the usual rear-edge panel of I/O ports—for monitor, audio, USB, and the like—relocated to the actual back of the board too, letting you put this PC, say, up against a wall with nary an external cable in sight, either. Predictably, though, Project Zero X has not seen the light of day beyond a trade show. The board we saw is highly proprietary, as was the outer chassis. With no sign of new Zero X-style boards or cases, the original “Zero” is all you can buy today. We’ll be on the lookout for any Zero X developments at CES 2026, though. —John Burek Lenovo’s Legion Tab Gen 3 impressed us at CES 2025 and again in May when we reviewed it. This gaming-focused tablet is small yet powerful, thanks to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor with a dedicated vapor chamber to manage thermals and 12GB of RAM to run applications. We really like its pixel-rich screen, which measures 8.8 inches and has 2,560-by-1,600-pixel resolution and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate for fast gaming action. In our review, we called it a “small tablet with big power,” and that’s exactly the experience it delivers at a reasonable $389. —Iyaz Akhtar The HMD Offgrid showed a lot of promise at its CES 2025 debut. This puck provides basic satellite SOS functionality for any smartphone across North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The idea is to allow for connectivity in backcountry regions where traditional cell service isn’t available, enabling emergency communications if needed. While the puck itself is inexpensive at $149.99, the associated service fees tally up quickly, according to subscriber reviews. Moreover, those who purchased and used the Offgrid suggest that customer support is limited and connectivity is inconsistent. Although the product is still available for sale, it appears that it never gained traction. The good news is that many US-based smartphone users have access to emergency satellite-based SOS services from their carrier, or even directly from Apple (if they have an iPhone). —Eric Zeman For something as seemingly future-tech as a robotic arm on a vacuum, the Saros Z70 didn't take long to come to market. I reviewed it mere months after it wowed us at CES. In practice, the robot arm needs another generation or two to bake, as it currently only works with a few objects and only on hard floors. It's more of a novelty than a useful extra, and the underlying robot vacuum itself isn't worth the premium $2,599 list price. —Andrew Gebhart The Ultraloq Bolt Mission isn't out yet. Ultraloq is still around, and so we might find out more about this lock and its release date at the upcoming show. It still sounds cool, with its unique combination of ultrawide-band and NFC tech that lets your door sense your precise location for automatic unlocking. The company's name holds prestige, as it has another lock on top of our current best list. So, I'm holding out hope that this one hits retailers soon and lives up to its promise, even if the eventual delivery is later than we initially hoped. —Andrew Gebhart Combining noise cancelling with a comfortable design, the $349 Ozlo Sleepbuds are meant to help you seal yourself away from the world when it's time to get some shuteye. They did indeed launch after impressing us at CES. Two of our sister sites, ZDNET and Mashable, have reviewed the buds. Ozlo won an Editors' Choice award from the former and a score of 3.8 (out of five) from the latter, with both praising their comfort and docking them for the slow launch of their promised sleep tracking feature. —Andrew Gebhart Adding to the growing category of smart rings with cool new features like taking an ECG and detecting atrial fibrillation from your finger, the Circular Ring 2 was also promising at CES for its simplified, app-based system for judging your ring size. The Circular Ring 2 did come to fruition in 2025, but our sister site ZDNET noted some meaningful shortcomings that made its appealing $249 price less attractive, such as a laggy app, slow syncing, and inaccurate data. —Andrew Gebhart The XReal One Pro stood out at CES 2025 for its still-impressive 57-degree field of view, but that isn’t why it ended up earning our Editors’ Choice for AR smart glasses, or why it’s become a regular part of my travel gear. Its head-tracking enables an ultra-wide mode that simulates a 3,840-by-1,080 monitor, which is big enough that you'll need to turn your head to see everything. It’s incredibly useful if, like me, you need either two monitors or an ultrawide to get any work done. XReal is working on more impressive projects, like the Android XR-powered Project Aura development kit. But for now, the XReal One Pro is just an excellent wearable display to use away from your desk. —Will Greenwald These over-ear headphones from JBL packed a wireless transmitter in the case, allowing you to stream audio content from just about any source. Think airplane in-seat entertainment systems or even your record player at home. As long as you have a 3.5mm or USB-C port available, you can pair the JBL Tour One M3 headphones and enjoy. This feature led to their award and CES 2025, and we still found it compelling once the headphones reached the market in April. But connectivity isn’t everything: The Tour One M3 headphones have 40mm Mica Dome drivers that produce rich sound, eight microphones to handle calls, active noise cancellation, lossless audio, and spatial sound. The noise cancellation wasn’t the best we’ve tested, but it was decent enough. In our review, we also appreciated the extensive 70 hours of battery life per charge and their support for new Bluetooth technologies, like Auracast. Perhaps the only bummer is that tariffs increased the price from $399.99 to $449.99 shortly after they reached the market. —Eric Zeman My CNET colleague David Katzmaier was right when he pinned down the LG G5 as the best-looking TV at the show that year, which is why both CNET and PCMag (me personally) gave it high marks when we were able to test it ourselves. If anything, I ended up liking it even more, awarding it 4.5 stars and an Editors’ Choice for its picture quality. It’s the brightest OLED I’ve ever tested and looks fantastic. I’d still recommend LG’s C5 (another Editors’ Choice, and the successor to the C4 I use at home) to most shoppers for its also-excellent picture and significantly lower price. —Will Greenwald Honda’s two funky electric cars are currently in development, and the SUV model is on track for a 2026 North American launch, Honda tells us. In October, the Japanese automaker unveiled an updated prototype of it in Japan—and the sleek, futuristic silhouette would certainly make waves on the road. The Saloon, a sedan model that’s likely to be less popular in the US, has been pushed back to 2027. —Emily Forlini Last year's top AI announcement from CES wasn't a chatbot or an AI-infused gadget. Instead, it was a unique foundation model, Nvidia Cosmos, which was developed as the first "world foundation model" built not for generating images or carrying on conversations, but to simulate and replicate the physical world to train future robots, self-driving cars, drones, and other autonomous tech. Instead of real-world training in closed courses and lab conditions, this model would accurately replicate those conditions virtually, allowing robots to be trained virtually. As we said last year, this virtual sandbox "could be the platform that enables future CES innovators...for years to come." One year later and this ambitious project has matured considerably. Since that CES announcement, the model has been released as open source for easier downloading and deployment. Major updates have introduced prediction capabilities, embedded reasoning agents, controllable world generation, and support for large-scale synthetic data generation. And companies are already taking advantage of it. Top robotics and AV companies, including 1X, Agile Robots, Agility Robotics, Figure AI, and Uber, were early adopters of the platform, and it's part of the training and simulation loop for many more major robotics and autonomous vehicle programs. It may not be the kind of flashy consumer-facing technology that people see in reviews and ads, but it's already a major part of the future that's being built.—Brian Westover The Asus ProArt Display 6K PA32QCV demonstrated its mettle in our testing, following up on its Best of CES 2025 with a four-star review and a PCMag Editors’ Choice. It has proven itself a capable and far more cost-effective alternative to the Pro Display XDR, which has the same screen size and resolution, although not quite matching the elite performance of Apple’s 6K flagship monitor. We’ll see how the PA32QCV stacks up against a new wave of 6K displays now coming through PC Labs. —Tony Hoffman The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D looked impressive on paper when it was announced during CES last year. When it launched in April 2025, test results showed the Ryzen 9 9950X3D to be arguably the fastest consumer processor of the year. In gaming, it has no real competitor, and only the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K can offer competition against the 9950X3D in non-gaming workloads. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D remains the fastest CPU for consumers to date, and there are no signs of a new strong competitor emerging soon, so the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is set to hold this position for some time to come. —Michael Justin Allen Sexton Following up on the elite-performing but energy-hogging Editors’ Choice Crucial T700 and T705, which require substantial heatsinks to avoid thermal throttling, Micron’s latest PCI Express 5.0 SSD, the Crucial P510, is a more mainstream, power-efficient model that ships with a simple heat spreader. While the P510 is a capable model, its performance numbers were more sedate than its predecessors in our testing, allowing Sandisk’s WD Black SN8100, which combines energy efficiency with record-setting benchmark numbers, to wrest PCMag’s PCI Express 5 SSD crown away from the Crucial line. —Tony Hoffman Our favorite PC DIY product at CES 2025, this Corsair case didn’t take long to get into our hands and on the market. The Frame 4000D received a four-star rating in our February review, and the chassis proved to be a solid entry, thanks to its unique front panel and easy build experience. It’s something of a budget model, and even more so since launch. Discounted widely at this writing to $99 and equipped with three ARGB fans, it’s a good bet for a first-time PC builder these price-sensitive days. —John Burek Flint has not posted any news on its site since December 2024—right before last CES—but that’s not because it’s gone belly up like startups tend to do. Quite the opposite. The Singapore-based company started producing its first two battery products in early 2025, CEO and Founder Carlos Charles tells us, and has “collaborations with leading brands, including Logitech, Amazon Devices, Apple, and others.” More details to come at CES 2026. —Emily Forlini One of the oddest gadgets to get attention at the show is Kirin’s electric spoon, which sends a low-intensity electric current through your tongue to make salty and umami flavors pop more without using as much actual salt. It’s an interesting idea, and as someone who’s licked his share of 9-volt batteries, I see the logic behind it. And, as far as I can tell from the slew of CES 2025 news stories highlighting it and very little other English-language coverage, it never came to this side of the Pacific. Vendors on eBay are selling it for $200 to $300 if you really want to get one, though. I’m more of a Kiuichi man than a Kirin one myself, anyway. —Will Greenwald Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

Ozlo won an Editors' Choice award from the former and a score of 3.8 (out of five) from the latter, with both praising their comfort and docking them for the slow launch of their promised sleep tracking feature. —Andrew Gebhart Adding to the growing category of smart rings with cool new features like taking an ECG and detecting atrial fibrillation from your finger, the Circular Ring 2 was also promising at CES for its simplified, app-based system for judging your ring size. The Circular Ring 2 did come to fruition in 2025, but our sister site ZDNET noted some meaningful shortcomings that made its appealing $249 price less attractive, such as a laggy app, slow syncing, and inaccurate data. —Andrew Gebhart The XReal One Pro stood out at CES 2025 for its still-impressive 57-degree field of view, but that isn’t why it ended up earning our Editors’ Choice for AR smart glasses, or why it’s become a regular part of my travel gear. Its head-tracking enables an ultra-wide mode that simulates a 3,840-by-1,080 monitor, which is big enough that you'll need to turn your head to see everything. It’s incredibly useful if, like me, you need either two monitors or an ultrawide to get any work done. XReal is working on more impressive projects, like the Android XR-powered Project Aura development kit. But for now, the XReal One Pro is just an excellent wearable display to use away from your desk. —Will Greenwald These over-ear headphones from JBL packed a wireless transmitter in the case, allowing you to stream audio content from just about any source. Think airplane in-seat entertainment systems or even your record player at home. As long as you have a 3.5mm or USB-C port available, you can pair the JBL Tour One M3 headphones and enjoy. This feature led to their award and CES 2025, and we still found it compelling once the headphones reached the market in April. But connectivity isn’t everything: The Tour One M3 headphones have 40mm Mica Dome drivers that produce rich sound, eight microphones to handle calls, active noise cancellation, lossless audio, and spatial sound. The noise cancellation wasn’t the best we’ve tested, but it was decent enough. In our review, we also appreciated the extensive 70 hours of battery life per charge and their support for new Bluetooth technologies, like Auracast. Perhaps the only bummer is that tariffs increased the price from $399.99 to $449.99 shortly after they reached the market. —Eric Zeman My CNET colleague David Katzmaier was right when he pinned down the LG G5 as the best-looking TV at the show that year, which is why both CNET and PCMag (me personally) gave it high marks when we were able to test it ourselves. If anything, I ended up liking it even more, awarding it 4.5 stars and an Editors’ Choice for its picture quality. It’s the brightest OLED I’ve ever tested and looks fantastic. I’d still recommend LG’s C5 (another Editors’ Choice, and the successor to the C4 I use at home) to most shoppers for its also-excellent picture and significantly lower price. —Will Greenwald Honda’s two funky electric cars are currently in development, and the SUV model is on track for a 2026 North American launch, Honda tells us. In October, the Japanese automaker unveiled an updated prototype of it in Japan—and the sleek, futuristic silhouette would certainly make waves on the road. The Saloon, a sedan model that’s likely to be less popular in the US, has been pushed back to 2027. —Emily Forlini Last year's top AI announcement from CES wasn't a chatbot or an AI-infused gadget. Instead, it was a unique foundation model, Nvidia Cosmos, which was developed as the first "world foundation model" built not for generating images or carrying on conversations, but to simulate and replicate the physical world to train future robots, self-driving cars, drones, and other autonomous tech. Instead of real-world training in closed courses and lab conditions, this model would accurately replicate those conditions virtually, allowing robots to be trained virtually. As we said last year, this virtual sandbox "could be the platform that enables future CES innovators...for years to come." One year later and this ambitious project has matured considerably. Since that CES announcement, the model has been released as open source for easier downloading and deployment. Major updates have introduced prediction capabilities, embedded reasoning agents, controllable world generation, and support for large-scale synthetic data generation. And companies are already taking advantage of it. Top robotics and AV companies, including 1X, Agile Robots, Agility Robotics, Figure AI, and Uber, were early adopters of the platform, and it's part of the training and simulation loop for many more major robotics and autonomous vehicle programs. It may not be the kind of flashy consumer-facing technology that people see in reviews and ads, but it's already a major part of the future that's being built.—Brian Westover The Asus ProArt Display 6K PA32QCV demonstrated its mettle in our testing, following up on its Best of CES 2025 with a four-star review and a PCMag Editors’ Choice. It has proven itself a capable and far more cost-effective alternative to the Pro Display XDR, which has the same screen size and resolution, although not quite matching the elite performance of Apple’s 6K flagship monitor. We’ll see how the PA32QCV stacks up against a new wave of 6K displays now coming through PC Labs. —Tony Hoffman The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D looked impressive on paper when it was announced during CES last year. When it launched in April 2025, test results showed the Ryzen 9 9950X3D to be arguably the fastest consumer processor of the year. In gaming, it has no real competitor, and only the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K can offer competition against the 9950X3D in non-gaming workloads. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D remains the fastest CPU for consumers to date, and there are no signs of a new strong competitor emerging soon, so the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is set to hold this position for some time to come. —Michael Justin Allen Sexton Following up on the elite-performing but energy-hogging Editors’ Choice Crucial T700 and T705, which require substantial heatsinks to avoid thermal throttling, Micron’s latest PCI Express 5.0 SSD, the Crucial P510, is a more mainstream, power-efficient model that ships with a simple heat spreader. While the P510 is a capable model, its performance numbers were more sedate than its predecessors in our testing, allowing Sandisk’s WD Black SN8100, which combines energy efficiency with record-setting benchmark numbers, to wrest PCMag’s PCI Express 5 SSD crown away from the Crucial line. —Tony Hoffman Our favorite PC DIY product at CES 2025, this Corsair case didn’t take long to get into our hands and on the market. The Frame 4000D received a four-star rating in our February review, and the chassis proved to be a solid entry, thanks to its unique front panel and easy build experience. It’s something of a budget model, and even more so since launch. Discounted widely at this writing to $99 and equipped with three ARGB fans, it’s a good bet for a first-time PC builder these price-sensitive days. —John Burek Flint has not posted any news on its site since December 2024—right before last CES—but that’s not because it’s gone belly up like startups tend to do. Quite the opposite. The Singapore-based company started producing its first two battery products in early 2025, CEO and Founder Carlos Charles tells us, and has “collaborations with leading brands, including Logitech, Amazon Devices, Apple, and others.” More details to come at CES 2026. —Emily Forlini One of the oddest gadgets to get attention at the show is Kirin’s electric spoon, which sends a low-intensity electric current through your tongue to make salty and umami flavors pop more without using as much actual salt. It’s an interesting idea, and as someone who’s licked his share of 9-volt batteries, I see the logic behind it. And, as far as I can tell from the slew of CES 2025 news stories highlighting it and very little other English-language coverage, it never came to this side of the Pacific. Vendors on eBay are selling it for $200 to $300 if you really want to get one, though. I’m more of a Kiuichi man than a Kirin one myself, anyway. —Will Greenwald Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

Title: The Best Products of CES 2025: Where Are They Now?

Time Published: 2025-12-30T14:00:00Z

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. It's been a wild year for tech innovation, and last January we previewed many of its most compelling new products at the Las Vegas Convention Center. As always, we searched the halls and rooms far and wide to examine cutting-edge gadgets and prototypes from more than 4,000 companies. To wrap up the show, we brought you our definitive list of the Best Tech of CES 2025—the 21 products that delighted us the most, and seemed destined to influence the rest of the industry in the months and years to come. CES is once again just a few days away, and we're all set to fly to Las Vegas. (Indeed, our joint digital media division, CNET Group, is choosing the official CES 2026 best-in-show winners, in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association.) But before we pack our bags, we asked our experts to look back at the best innovations they picked from last year's show. We wanted answers to the most critical questions: What were our choices like in the real world as actual production models? Did they measure up when we tested them, or did they disappoint? Did they even come out at all? Here's what our experts discovered. When we first saw the Asus Zenbook A14, we were impressed by its slim, lightweight design, distinctive magnesium-alloy construction and Ceraluminum design, and long-lasting battery—enough to name it the best laptop of CES 2025. When we reviewed it in May, I was still wowed by all of those details, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus was a bit underwhelming, even for a Copilot+ PC. But even with low test scores, the Zenbook A14 still earned a 4-star rating as an excellent ultraportable system. It may not have won an Editors' Choice award, but it's currently listed as both the Best Windows Ultraportable Laptop Under $1,000 and the Best Budget OLED Laptop, making it a smart buy for many.—Brian Westover We first got a look at the (confusingly named) Vision X AI 2nd at Computex 2024, before seeing it again in a more developed state at CES. It's a sizable and powerful gaming desktop in its own right, but its calling card is a 13-inch touch display on the front panel. This full HD panel can be used to show system diagnostics, apps, or even as a second monitor. The "AI" and "2nd" in its name refer to the NPU-bearing Arrow Lake 200 processors inside, while top-end Nvidia GPUs power gaming and graphics workloads. The main update about how this fared in 2025? It finally went on sale as a finished product, though stock is limited and configurations cost many thousands of dollars. (MSI is currently selling one model on its website for $5,499). We didn't review it ourselves yet, but it is now available for interested enthusiasts. —Matt Buzzi The Lenovo Legion Go S is a system full of potential, but when I finally got my hands on the Windows 11-powered handheld, its gaming performance ultimately let me down. The AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor proved too underpowered to deliver substantial gains over its predecessor and inherited much of its predecessor's clunkiness. However, Lenovo rectified most of the system’s flaws with the release of a SteamOS variant. With Windows 11 out of the picture, games performed far better than they did on the Windows-powered Go S, and it’s our recommendation for Steam Deck users looking to upgrade their system. —Zackery Cuevas MSI’s Project Zero X was an experimental “what next?” iteration on the company’s Project Zero, an initiative for PC building that enables super-minimalist, clean-looking desktop PCs. Project Zero uses motherboards with connectors on the underside of the PCB to let you hide all the PC’s internal cables behind the board. CES 2025’s Project Zero X took that to another level, with the whole board front covered in fancy heat sinks and the usual rear-edge panel of I/O ports—for monitor, audio, USB, and the like—relocated to the actual back of the board too, letting you put this PC, say, up against a wall with nary an external cable in sight, either. Predictably, though, Project Zero X has not seen the light of day beyond a trade show. The board we saw is highly proprietary, as was the outer chassis. With no sign of new Zero X-style boards or cases, the original “Zero” is all you can buy today. We’ll be on the lookout for any Zero X developments at CES 2026, though. —John Burek Lenovo’s Legion Tab Gen 3 impressed us at CES 2025 and again in May when we reviewed it. This gaming-focused tablet is small yet powerful, thanks to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor with a dedicated vapor chamber to manage thermals and 12GB of RAM to run applications. We really like its pixel-rich screen, which measures 8.8 inches and has 2,560-by-1,600-pixel resolution and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate for fast gaming action. In our review, we called it a “small tablet with big power,” and that’s exactly the experience it delivers at a reasonable $389. —Iyaz Akhtar The HMD Offgrid showed a lot of promise at its CES 2025 debut. This puck provides basic satellite SOS functionality for any smartphone across North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The idea is to allow for connectivity in backcountry regions where traditional cell service isn’t available, enabling emergency communications if needed. While the puck itself is inexpensive at $149.99, the associated service fees tally up quickly, according to subscriber reviews. Moreover, those who purchased and used the Offgrid suggest that customer support is limited and connectivity is inconsistent. Although the product is still available for sale, it appears that it never gained traction. The good news is that many US-based smartphone users have access to emergency satellite-based SOS services from their carrier, or even directly from Apple (if they have an iPhone). —Eric Zeman For something as seemingly future-tech as a robotic arm on a vacuum, the Saros Z70 didn't take long to come to market. I reviewed it mere months after it wowed us at CES. In practice, the robot arm needs another generation or two to bake, as it currently only works with a few objects and only on hard floors. It's more of a novelty than a useful extra, and the underlying robot vacuum itself isn't worth the premium $2,599 list price. —Andrew Gebhart The Ultraloq Bolt Mission isn't out yet. Ultraloq is still around, and so we might find out more about this lock and its release date at the upcoming show. It still sounds cool, with its unique combination of ultrawide-band and NFC tech that lets your door sense your precise location for automatic unlocking. The company's name holds prestige, as it has another lock on top of our current best list. So, I'm holding out hope that this one hits retailers soon and lives up to its promise, even if the eventual delivery is later than we initially hoped. —Andrew Gebhart Combining noise cancelling with a comfortable design, the $349 Ozlo Sleepbuds are meant to help you seal yourself away from the world when it's time to get some shuteye.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are little changed this morning after two consecutive sessions of losses for major indexes; tech stocks have stabilized after slumping on Monday; gold and silver prices are surging after the precious metals posted steep declines to start the week; Facebook-parent Meta announced it acquired AI agent firm Manus. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are holding steady this morning after major indexes lost ground on Monday for the second straight session. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were hovering near unchanged in recent trading. Bitcoin was at $87,900, up from an overnight low of around $87,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences mortgage rates and costs on other consumer loans, was at 4.14%, up from 4.12% at yesterday's close. Oil prices continued to climb amid tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were up 0.3% at $58.30 per barrel, trading near their highest levels of the month. Shares of some of the world's biggest technology companies are back on firmer footing Tuesday after leading the market's downturn yesterday.Concerns about whether major tech companies will profit from massive investments in artificial intelligence have weighed on investor sentiment in recent months. In premarket trading Tuesday, Tesla (TSLA) shares were up 0.5%, after the stock fell 3.3% on Monday to lead Nasdaq decliners. Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) inched higher after shedding more than 1% yesterday, while Palantir (PLTR) ticked higher after dropping more than 2% Monday and Oracle (ORCL) was little changed after sliding 1%. Gold and silver prices are bouncing back from the big declines posted yesterday after exchange operator CME Group made a key change to its metals contracts. Gold futures were recently up 1.7% at $4,415 an ounce, after sliding as low as $4,330 yesterday. Silver futures were up more than 7% this morning, at around $75.55 an ounce. After a weeks-long rally that had lifted the precious metals to a series of record highs, gold and silver plunged on Monday after CME raised its margin requirements for precious metals contracts. Higher margin requirements require traders to add money to accounts that insure against default, effectively raising their costs to trade the futures contracts. Traders will be watching today’s release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's December meeting for clues about the direction the Federal Reserve will take on interest rates in 2026. The minutes, which are set to be released at 2 p.m. ET, will provide more insight into the FOMC’s decision to cut the Fed's benchmark lending rate for a third straight meeting. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady when it meets in January, though rising unemployment levels, along with tame inflation readings, could put pressure on FOMC members to reduce borrowing costs again. Investors will also be monitoring home price data set to be released at 9 a.m. ET. Meta Platforms (META) announced it acquired Manus, a Singapore-based firm that develops autonomous general-purpose AI agents. In a release, Meta said that Manus agents are able to “independently execute complex tasks like market research, coding, and data analysis.” Meta said it would integrate Manus services into its offerings. The move by the Facebook parent company comes as it continues to make big investments in its AI business. Shares of Meta, which through Monday's close were up 13% in 2025, were little changed in premarket trading.

Investing With gold rebounding about $55 this morning, mining stocks, like Newmont Corp., are up about $1.85. While the RKLB stock took a breather after a substantial run from $40.88 to nearly $80 a share, it’s seeing further upside. After rocketing nearly $10 higher on Monday, shares of Micron Technology are up another $2.10 this morning. Sending You to Google News in 3 © RomanR / Shutterstock.com With gold rebounding about $55 this morning, mining stocks, like Newmont Corp. (NYSE: NEM), are up about $1.85. All after the overbought stock lost nearly $6 of value yesterday, with gold’s 4.5% pullback. Shares of SSR Mining (NASDAQ: SSRM) are up about 50 cents on the rebound. Even shares of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) are up about 80 cents on the news. Despite yesterday’s pullback in gold, we have to remember that growing geopolitical tension, economic uncertainty, expectations of further interest rate cuts, a weak dollar, and strong interest from central banks could send gold prices screaming even higher. In fact, as we noted just yesterday, Bank of America is targeting $5,000 by 2026. JPMorgan is targeting $5,055. HSBC analysts are targeting $5,000 by early 2026, too. Shares of Rocket Lab Corp. (NASDAQ: RKLB) are up about $2 a share in premarket. While the stock took a breather after a substantial run from $40.88 to nearly $80 a share, it’s seeing further upside. Helping, analysts at Needham recently raised their price target on RKLH to $90 from $63, with a buy rating. All after the U.S. Space Development Agency awarded RKLB a prime contract to design and manufacture 18 satellites for the Tracking Layer Tranche 3 program under the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, as noted in a press release. “Under the $816 million contract, Rocket Lab will deliver satellites equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors to provide global, persistent detection and tracking of emerging missile threats, including hypersonic systems,” as noted by Seeking Alpha. Recent earnings weren’t too shabby either. In its third quarter, the company’s revenue was up 48% year-over-year to $155.1 million. It also narrowed its Q3 EPS loss to -$0.03 from -$0.10 a year ago. Moving forward, the company guided for Q4 revenue of between $170 million and $180 million, as compared to expectations of $171 million. It’s also calling for an adjusted EBITDA loss of $23 million to $29 million. After rocketing nearly $10 higher on Monday, shares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) are up another $2.10 this morning. As we noted the other day, CNBC reported the MU stock was gaining ground after DigiTimes reported that, “citing industry sources, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are raising prices for their fifth-generation high-bandwidth memory 3E chips by nearly 20% for 2026 deliveries.” This comes just days after Micron crushed earnings and guidance. That was after Micron’s EPS of $4.78 beat by 82 cents. Revenue of $13.64 billion beat by $760 million. Analysts were looking for $4.78 per share on revenue of $14.3 billion. Moving forward, the company expects to earn between $8.22 and $8.62 per share. It also expects revenue to be between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion for the second quarter.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks EDITOR’S NOTE: This story contains discussion of suicide. Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters. In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world. Hundreds of billions of dollars spent, a surge in mental health concerns and thousands of jobs lost. The link between it all? Artificial intelligence, the buzzy yet controversial technology being depicted as the future or the stock market’s next bubble, depending on who you ask. Although AI has been a key technology behind the scenes for decades, the arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022 pushed the tech to the frontlines. The rise of AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini has gradually influenced online services used by millions every day, from Google search’s AI Mode to the AI chatbots built into Instagram and Amazon. In other words, AI is starting to reshape the front door to the internet. But 2025 was also the year AI expanded beyond our screens and began impacting national policy, global trade relations and the stock market. It also raised important questions about whether the tech should be trusted in our jobs, classrooms and relationships. That’s expected to continue in 2026. “In previous years, (AI) was a shiny new object… And I think this last year was a lot more serious uses of the technology,” said James Landay, co-founder and co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. “And I think people are waking up to actually understanding both some of the benefits and the risks.” Count President Donald Trump among AI’s biggest believers; the technology has been a cornerstone of his second term so far. For example, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, the posterchild of the AI boom, has become a fixture of Trump’s inner circle. And the president has used Nvidia’s and AMD’s AI processors as bargaining chips in the ongoing trade war with China. This year, Trump introduced an AI action plan aimed at stripping back regulation and boosting AI use in the government. He also signed multiple AI-related executive orders, including a controversial one seeking to block states from enforcing their own AI rules. The move was seen as a win for Silicon Valley, but online safety advocates fear it’ll enable tech companies to evade accountability for AI-related risks. Next year will likely see a legal fight over the order and states’ abilities to regulate AI — with some critics arguing it won’t hold up in court. The absence of broad AI guardrails has been in the national spotlight this year and not for good reason. A slew of reports and lawsuits this year have alleged that AI companions like ChatGPT and Character.AI have contributed to mental health episodes and, in some cases, suicide among teens. “Please don’t leave the noose out … Let’s make this space the first place where someone actually sees you.” That’s how ChatGPT is said to have responded when 16-year-old Adam Raine wrote that he wanted to leave a noose out in his room so that someone would find it and stop him before he committed suicide. Raine’s parents sued OpenAI in August alleging that the popular chatbot advised the teen on his suicide. OpenAI and Character.AI have since announced parental controls and other changes to improve teen safety, including removing the ability for teens to have back-and-forth conversations with chatbots on Character.AI’s app. Meta also plans to let parents block their children from chatting with AI characters on Instagram next year. But it’s not just teens; a growing number of reports have indicated that AI has contributed to isolation from loved ones and breaks from reality among adults, too. One man told CNN that ChatGPT convinced him he was making technological breakthroughs that turned out to be a delusion. OpenAI said it has worked with clinical mental health experts to enable ChatGPT to “better recognize and support people in moments of distress,” including by expanding access to crisis hotlines, pointing users towards professional help when needed and adding reminders to take breaks. Still, OpenAI has said it ultimately wants to “treat adult users like adults,” allowing them to personalize their chats and even discuss erotica with ChatGPT. Psychiatrist and lawyer Marlynn Wei told CNN that she expects AI chatbots “will increasingly become the first place people turn for emotional support,” further underscoring safety concerns. Young users are among the most likely to turn to AI for support, she said. “The limitations of general-purpose chatbots, including hallucinations, sycophancy, lack of confidentiality, lack of clinical judgment, and lack of reality testing, along with broader ethical and privacy concerns, will continue to create mental health risks,” she said via email. Mental health experts and safety advocates say they hope to see greater guardrails from tech companies, especially when it comes to young AI users. But they worry the fight over regulatory power between the states and the federal government will impact the implementation of such mandated safety measures. At the same time, huge investments are being poured into data centers and AI infrastructure. Meta, Microsoft and Amazon, among others, have spent tens of billions in capital expenditures this year alone, and McKinsey & Company expects companies to invest nearly $7 trillion in data center infrastructure globally by 2030. That surge in spending has sparked concerns both for consumers and for Wall Street. Some Americans have watched their electricity bills climb and job prospects sink due to AI, while some companies behind the AI boom have seen their stock reach new heights. The massive investments have also fueled worries that the hype and spending in AI is growing faster than the tech’s true value. That’s prompted investors to grill executives at Meta and Microsoft about future returns on their AI infrastructure investments during earnings calls this year. It doesn’t help that a relatively small group of companies have seemingly driven the investments, trading money and technology back and forth. Christina Melas-Kyriazi, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, said it’s common for new transformative technologies to be “overbuilt.” The big question heading into 2026 is whether investors are prepared for the volatility that comes with it, especially since she says a market correction is “likely at some point.” But they’ll likely have more data at their disposal to help make those decisions, said Erik Brynjolfsson, a senior fellow for the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI and director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. He said more dashboards will likely emerge in 2026 to track how AI is impacting productivity and jobs. “The debate will shift from whether AI matters to how quickly its effects are diffusing, who is being left behind, and which complementary investments best turn AI capability into broad-based prosperity,” he said. This year, thousands of tech workers were left jobless as a wave of layoffs swept the industry. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, among other tech companies, made significant cuts to their staff, driven at least in part by AI. Amazon laid off 14,000 corporate employees in October in an effort to operate more leanly in the age of AI. Meta let 600 workers go from its AI division, following an earlier hiring spree, so that it, too, could be more nimble. Some believe AI will lead to more layoffs, while others say it’ll create fresh opportunities. But one thing is certain: More change is coming. “This was the year that we saw skill demands totally change when it comes to what is required to be able to pull off your job,” said Dan Roth, editor-in-chief of LinkedIn. “…And I think the answer for next year is it just accelerates.” CNN’s Matt Egan and John Towfighi contributed to this report.

Warren Buffett is to investing what Einstein was to physics, Edison was to invention, and Mozart was to music. There will never be another one like him, and you should pity anyone who says they aspire to be “the next Warren Buffett.” Whenever I hear someone talk about “the next Warren Buffett,” I think of Antonio Salieri, Mozart’s inferior rival, played brilliantly by F. Murray Abraham in the movie Amadeus. In the film’s climactic scene, Mozart dictates his Requiem to Salieri from his deathbed. As Salieri struggles to keep up with the genius pouring forth, his face is equal parts awestruck and ravaged. It is the face of a person who knows he is doomed—not to failure, but to something perhaps even worse: mediocrity. As we pause to honor the master’s legacy, however, it’s clear that Buffett’s oeuvre is in fact divided into two distinct periods. The first lasted from shortly after he graduated from Columbia Business School in 1951 as Ben Graham’s star pupil to the end of the dot.com bust. If you had invested in Buffett’s partnership in the early days and then rolled your money into Berkshire Hathaway when that old textile company became his investing vehicle, over the next fifty years you would have nearly 500 times more money than if you’d invested in the S&P 500. You don’t get a sense of how awesome, in the original sense of the word, that figure is until you translate the difference into actual dollars. A million dollars invested in the S&P from 1957 through 2007 would have been worth $166 million—but a million invested with Buffett would have been worth almost $81 billion. Fast forward another 18 years, and your $1 million with Buffett is now worth almost $428 billion. This is where the legend of Buffett’s genius rightly springs. What is less well known, however, and even less discussed, is that these first five decades account for more than 100% of Buffett’s career outperformance. While he beat the S&P by a factor of almost 500 in his first fifty years, he has underperformed it in the eighteen years since. As the chart below shows, a million dollars invested in the S&P from the end of 2007 through mid-December 2025 would today be worth $6.6 million, almost 25% more than the $5.3 million you would have earned in Berkshire’s stock. The data lead to an obvious conclusion. For most of the 21st century, Buffett’s record was mediocre—Salieriesque, one might say. How could this happen? How could a practitioner as driven and imaginative as Warren Buffett produce such genius, then become slightly below average? These questions are worth pursuing. To understand why Buffett excelled in the 20th century but hasn’t in the 21st will help us understand two things. First, what once made his style of value investing so good. Second, why he faltered, and how value investors must change if we want to excel in the digital age. I realize that by calling attention to these facts I am violating one of value investing’s cardinal commandments: Thou shalt have no other gods beside Warren Buffett. To those deeply immersed in it, value investing, invented by Ben Graham more than a century ago and passed directly to Buffett, resembles a religious order in many ways. It has many principles and precepts and a long list of dos and don’ts. Our discipline, we believe, distinguishes us from growth investors and momentum investors, whom we look down on as heathens. Unlike them, we think, we aren’t stock jockeys or herd followers. We have rules. We trust that these rules will lead us to outperform. And when we do outperform, we believe it is not a matter of luck, but of patiently applied skill. This fixity of purpose can lead to stilted and dogmatic thinking. To suggest that Buffett was Mozart in the first three-quarters of his investing career and then Salieri in his last quarter represents a kind of heresy to many in the value church. Fortunately, one of the many salutary things about value investing is that recourse to hard facts is another of its cardinal principles. Value investing has had one major reformation in its 100-year history, a reformation driven by Buffett himself. As Buffett’s two disparate records suggest, if we are to succeed in the digital age, value investors must again evolve. Like Buffett’s overall record, his magisterial performance in the late 20th century is in fact composed of two discrete periods. The first comes from what Chris Begg at East Coast Asset Management calls Buffett’s Value 1.0 days, when he invested in Ben Graham-like “cigar butts,” companies that were cheap not on the merits of their business quality but on their asset liquidation value. Early on, Buffett scored big with such fire-sale investments as Dempster Mill Manufacturing and National American Fire Insurance. His purchase of Berkshire Hathaway, a dying New England textile mill he bought because it was worth more dead than alive, was the very distillation of Ben Graham’s quantitative, defensive style. Berkshire in fact survives only because Buffett began to listen to his acerbic partner, Charlie Munger. Munger loathed Graham’s cigar-butt approach, referring to it over the years as “madness,” “a snare and a delusion,” and a discipline that “ignored relevant facts.” From the early days of their collaboration, Munger pressed Buffett to look at a business’s earning power rather than its liquidation value, and to use Berkshire as a holding company to invest in such companies. The real money, Munger argued, lay not in a business’s fire-sale value but in its ability to generate growing profits over its lifetime. Buffett embraced Munger’s style, and thus Value 2.0 was born. With its focus on good, growing businesses, Value 2.0 was as suited to the postwar world as Graham’s defensive Value 1.0 was suited to the Depression. The United States in the 1950s was prosperous and remarkably stable, and its business dynamics were resistant to material change. Television, for example, became the dominant mass medium after World War II, and TV itself was dominated by only three national networks for nearly forty years. The same was true of print media. Earlier in the 20th century, major cities like Washington, D.C., had more than 100 newspapers. By 1981, the city had only one, The Washington Post, and Berkshire was a major shareholder. As the 1950s became the 1960s, Buffett and Munger’s key insight into this ecosystem was as simple as it was brilliant. They didn’t label it as such, but in hindsight we can say they diagnosed and then invested in what might be called the mass brand-mass media industrial complex. Only a few outlets dominated the media, giving them a chokehold on advertising dollars. Using these channels, dominant consumer-product companies could take incremental market share simply by outspending their rivals. If a company like Budweiser or Coca-Cola began with 50% more revenue than its nearest rival, Bud or Coke could spend the same percentage of revenue on advertising as Miller or Pepsi and still outspend them by 50%. Buffett and Munger understood and exploited this more quickly and more deeply than anyone else. Media companies like Disney and ABC and consumer product companies like General Foods became major Berkshire investments in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, as did the few big advertising agencies that supported the mass brand-mass media industrial complex. Looking back, it’s remarkable how slow-moving and static competitive dynamics were in the late 20thcentury. Of course there was technological innovation—the silicon chip was commercialized in the 1950s, and on its back the transistor radio and then the mobile phone—but the companies that won in the marketplace were steady, grind-it-out growers in sectors where the battle lines had been drawn and it was easy to identify the commanding players. These sectors included not only media and consumer products but also banks, which often dominated their markets. Buffett loved banks and invested in them profitably for decades, and he extended his interest in financial services to other companies like American Express and GEICO, which combined the best of consumer product companies—brand identity—with the raw scale economies of large financial institutions. Given this, it’s no wonder Buffett came to land on the medieval term “moat” to describe competitive advantage. Buffett learned early on in Value 2.0 that companies with a solid, entrenched competitive position won, and kept winning—slowly but surely, year by year. Likewise, he learned to favor smart, cautious executives who deepened their moat but didn’t try to expand into new territory. Eisenhower, pushing the U.S. Army slowly but surely toward Germany in 1944, was the right archetype for Buffett. Napoleons made for good copy but almost always overreached. In the late 20th century, investing with this template proved extremely lucrative. Markets rewarded plodders and punished risk takers and innovators. When in 1985 Coca-Cola announced it was changing its formula to “New Coke,” its customers were so angry that Coke went back to the same mixture John Pemberton had come up with in 1886. As one of the three major national television networks, all ABC had to do was produce reasonably good programming to keep its hold on millions of American eyeballs. My favorite example of all is that of Scotch Tape, which was invented during the Depression by an engineer at 3M named Richard Drew. Despite its enormous mass-market appeal, no competitor tried to improve upon Scotch Tape for more than a generation after its introduction. Scotch Tape thus had the profitable niche of consumer adhesive to itself for thirty years. Can you imagine a company today maintaining its lead for thirty months, let alone thirty years, absent any innovation? As for investment in technology, Wall Street regarded it for much of the 20th century as a kind of social utility: It was wonderful for civilization, but it was terrible for stockholders. All too often, research and development spending in semiconductors and related technologies was deemed speculative or, just as bad, easily copied and therefore moatless. As a result, even into the late 1980s, good Value 2.0 investors like Peter Lynch dismissed tech stocks as a reliable way to make money. “For every single product in a hot industry,” Lynch wrote in One Up on Wall Street, “there are a thousand MIT graduates trying to figure out how to make it cheaper in Taiwan.” Then, sometime around the turn of the millennium, the world began to change. Ironically, the tipping point came right after the dot.com crash, which was the ultimate proof point to “good investors” that investing in tech stocks always ended poorly. What these investors failed to account for was the ineluctable power of Moore’s Law. Moore’s Law is as simple as it is profound: It stipulates that roughly every two years, computing power becomes twice as powerful with minimal incremental cost. Moore’s Law guaranteed that by the year 2000, computing power had become 30 million times more powerful than when semiconductors were commercialized in the 1950s. Thirty million times is a lot, but it wasn’t enough to generate the critical mass of a digital ecosystem. In 2000, for example, only 1% of the world’s population could access broadband internet, and only 15% could afford a cellphone. This goes a long way to explaining the dot.com crash—there simply wasn’t enough computing power to support the connected world we see around us today. However, Moore’s Law didn’t stop during or after the dot.com crash. Computing power became 30 million times more powerful between 2000 and 2002, then 60 million times more powerful between 2002 and 2004, and so on until sometime around 2010, it became strong enough to enable the technology-rich environment we now inhabit. Today, well more than half of the world’s population has both broadband access and a powerful smartphone. Today, much of the world searches, shops, chats, banks, and performs many other everyday activities online. Because consumers tend to standardize on a single application—Facebook for social media, Microsoft for office tools, Google for search—you also have tech companies that possess the customer loyalty and predictability that Buffett rightly craved. Suddenly, entire economic sectors became existentially threatened by digitally driven alternatives, and these threats extended to most of the hunting grounds that Buffett and Munger had for so long favored. Mass media, already disrupted by the advent of cable television, became even more fragmented as Google, YouTube, and Facebook usurped television’s dominion. In a fragmented media landscape, powerful brands like Coke and Budweiser could no longer press their advantage; it’s easy now to launch a niche brand using TikTok and Instagram. One of banks’ central pillars, its network of brick-and-mortar branches, is increasingly less relevant in a world that does much of its business digitally. Buffett and Munger found it hard to adjust to such changes—and at their age, who wouldn’t? Buffett was 73 when Google IPO’d. It’s difficult to fault him for not quite tuning in to the new narrative. On the other hand, at times Buffett demonstrated an almost willful resistance to the changes brought on by the digital age. He never learned how to use email, for example, and he gave up his flip phone for a smartphone only in 2020, thirteen years after the advent of the iPhone and four years after he invested in Apple. Exquisitely comfortable in the late 20th century ecosystem, he loved reading physical newspapers every morning and talking on the telephone from his office in the Midwest. Every year, he’d take the stage in Omaha for his annual meeting and drink his Cherry Cokes and eat his Dilly Bars. Munger would make a wisecrack, break off a chunk of See’s peanut brittle, and it was all good—until it wasn’t. Still, Buffett was too brilliant a business analyst not to grasp what was happening. He and Munger saw how digital businesses like Google were radically better businesses than even his best Value 2.0 investments. Coke sold sugar water, which had big margins, but to get to market Coke had to build bottling plants and establish a network of trucks and vending machines. When a software company wants to enter a new geographic market, its engineers simply write new code, hit “deploy,” and voila—the product is available around the globe, instantaneously and with almost no incremental costs. The result has been the rise of the most successful companies ever produced. Even though Coke was incorporated in 1892 and Alphabet was incorporated more than a century later, Alphabet now makes more than $100 billion in annual profit—nearly ten times more than Coca-Cola. In what amounted to an extemporaneous master class on the power of digital economics, Buffett acknowledged this superiority at his 2017 meeting. “This is a very different world than when Andrew Carnegie was building a steel mill and then using the earnings to build another steel mill and getting very rich in the process, or Rockefeller was building refineries and buying tank cars and everything,” Buffett told the crowd. “I don’t think people quite appreciate the difference. “Our capitalist system was built on tangible assets, but this asset-light model is so much better,” he continued. “Andrew Mellon would be absolutely baffled by looking at the high-cap companies now. I mean, the idea that you could create hundreds of billions of value, essentially without assets…” “Fast,” Munger interjected. “Fast, yeah,” Buffett agreed. “You literally don’t need any money to run the five tech companies that are worth collectively more than $2.5 trillion in the stock market, who have outpaced any number of those names that were familiar, if you looked at the Fortune 500 list 30 or 40 years ago, you know, whether it was Exxon or General Motors, or you name it.” This is all standard, brilliant Buffett stuff—but why, aside from Apple, did he never pull the trigger on these stocks? Over the last twenty years he has been consistently underweight technology stocks, and he forewent hundreds of billions of dollars of value creation in doing so. Having evolved so well from Value 1.0 to 2.0, why did he fail to evolve to Value 3.0? And if he had, would it have made his record better? The second question is easier to settle than the first. The answer to it is unquestionably yes—Berkshire Hathaway’s stock performance would have been materially better had he followed through on his observations about the superiority of tech’s business models and invested in more of them. When Buffett started buying Apple nearly a decade ago, if he had deployed excess cash (the cash he didn’t need for potential insurance claims) into each of the three mega-tech stocks besides Apple that he knew best—Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft—I estimate that Berkshire Hathaway’s market cap would not be the $1 trillion it is now, but at least $1.6 trillion. It’s important to note that this calculation incorporates only the market appreciation of these three stocks. If the market had capitalized Buffett’s “getting tech” and given Berkshire Hathaway’s stock a greater premium as a result, then Berkshire’s gain would have been greater. (Berkshire did buy $6.5 billion worth of Alphabet’s stock earlier this year, though it’s not clear whether it was Buffett or his lieutenants who pulled the trigger on the purchase). While rough, my estimates are not crazy. Buffett understood all three stocks well. He was close friends with Bill Gates, Microsoft’s founder, who explained the company’s competitive advantages to Buffett many times. At his 2017 annual meeting, Buffett admitted that he “blew it” by not investing in Amazon and Alphabet. Investing a big slug of his cash in these liquid, mega-cap stocks would have solved the “problem of large numbers” that some who seek to rationalize Buffett’s average latter-day record point to. And my estimate assumes that Buffett bought only a single slug of each. To those who say, “Buffett didn’t miss tech—he had Apple,” I would say two things. First, thank goodness Buffett invested in Apple—can you imagine what his recent record would look like if he hadn’t? Second, I would argue that by the time he invested in Apple the company was acting more like one of his mature, moated consumer products companies than it was a company we would recognize as a “tech company:” ambitious and forward-looking in its investment and R&D spending. When Buffett first bought Apple shares in 2016, it had transformed into a business that had much more in common with Coke and Gillette than it did Amazon or Alphabet. People forget that two important things happened in the years immediately before Berkshire began to buy Apple. First, Steve Jobs became terminally ill and was replaced in 2011 by Tim Cook. Suddenly, the design visionary was out, and the man whose main achievement was perfecting the company’s supply chain was in. While Jobs brought us the iPod and the iPhone, he also was responsible for the Lisa and the Newton, and he once almost bought Universal Music, a purchase that would have meant handing over cash or stock worth nearly Apple’s entire market capitalization at the time. That wasn’t going to happen under Cook. The quartermaster had replaced the field marshal. Salieri replaced Mozart, and this suited Buffett fine. Then, two years after the management change, Carl Icahn launched a proxy fight to force Apple to stop accumulating cash and start returning it to shareholders via massive share buybacks. Icahn never said it exactly like this, but the subtext was clear: With the genius gone and the iPhone bringing in billions, it was time to act like a mature consumer products company. Cook had already begun buying back stock, but Icahn wanted him to do much more, and Cook eventually obliged. By 2015, Cook was saying things like, “By and large, my view is for cash that we don’t need, with some level of buffer, we want to give it back. We’re not hoarders.” The next year, Buffett started buying shares. Post-Jobs, Apple was exactly the kind of company Buffett understood and loved. It had a moat, it worked hard to expand that moat, but beyond that it wasn’t terribly ambitious. A technocrat, not an innovator, was in charge. You can easily see this in not only the tone of Cook’s remarks but in his actions. What is Apple’s biggest innovation since Jobs died in 2011? The Apple Watch and—it’s almost sad to say it—AirPods? As you can see from the accompanying chart, Apple ranks near the bottom of the Magnificent Seven in terms of research and development spending as a percentage of sales. Alphabet and Amazon spend nearly twice as much, and Meta spends three times more. It’s hard to argue that Cook’s plan hasn’t worked. The stock has risen more than tenfold since Buffett began buying it, and Apple remains the second-most-valuable company in the world. But Microsoft is up eight-and-a-half times since Buffett began buying Apple; Amazon is up nearly sevenfold; and Alphabet has octupled. All have dramatically outperformed the market, and Buffett had plenty of evidence almost a decade ago that they would. He understood their competitive advantages ago; he admitted he blew it by not buying them; but he didn’t. Why? Because like other good late 20th century investors, Buffett learned that reinvestment, especially in technology, leads to heartbreak rather than value creation. In his era, companies that reinvested often destroyed value rather than created it. But that is not the era we live in today. Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and hundreds of other smaller and lesser-known companies all reinvest a double-digit percentage of their revenues in research and development. The superiority of digital business models permits them to. Without a cost of goods sold—zeros and ones are metaphysical rather than physical—what an average tech company spends on R&D exceeds the entire profit margin of the average American corporation by 50%. Today, unlike a generation ago, there’s abundant evidence that companies which invest in the future will and should be rewarded. Amazon’s average P/E multiple has averaged more than 200x since it went public, but the stock continues to appreciate. Why? Because investors continue to believe that Amazon is depressing current profits to maximize future ones. It’s a “jam tomorrow” company rather than a “jam today” one. Apple is more jam today. It continues to return capital, which is fine, but you don’t get something for nothing. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have plowed billions of profits into new industries like cloud computing, driverless cars, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence; Apple is not a major player in any of these mega-trends. The iPhone accounts for most Apple’s profits. What happens if geopolitical friction impairs the company’s smartphone supply chain, which is still heavily dependent on China? And what happens to Apple if worldwide demand for the iPhone falters, which it perhaps already has? Economic nationalism has begun to cause the Chinese to turn to domestic devices, and China accounts for 20% of the company’s sales. If the courts rule that Google can no longer pay Apple to be its default search engine, almost a quarter of Apple’s profit evaporates. These vulnerabilities illustrate the wisdom of Elon Musk’s 2018 dictum that “moats are lame. If your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the pace of innovation.” The wonderful thing about the early 21st century is that, unlike Buffett, we don’t have to choose between mature, moated companies on the one hand and high growth but speculative ones on the other. Today, in a Value 3.0 world, we can have moats and brands and high growth as well. Despite its enormous size, big tech continues to grow its topline at multiples of the growth rate of the American economy. Amazon has been in business for more than a generation but it still has only a single-digit domestic market share of both retail sales and computing operations. The company’s market cap is so large that we tend to forget such statistics, but like age, market cap turns out to be just a number. The investment landscape changed once after World War II, when American business was stable and slowly growing and Buffett could invest with confidence in dominant, moated enterprises. It has now changed again with the advent of huge, winner-take-most digital platform companies—not just the mega-tech companies, but dozens of others like Intuit and Adobe, ARM and Atlassian, Uber and Airbnb. All these companies dominate their niche as much as Coke and Bud did in their day. Because the economy has changed, as value investors we must change with it. Part of this recalibration needs to be quantitative. We need to adjust our metrics to account for companies like Amazon, who spend on the future through the income statement. Such spending penalizes current earnings and makes its stock appear more expensive, but, as GEICO did when Buffett bought the company 30 years ago, the spending boosts future earnings. There’s another, broader recalibration we must also undertake. Just as Munger told Buffett when they were young men, Value 1.0 was useful in its time but, as business and markets evolved, it ignored certain relevant facts. With its emphasis on milking a business rather than reinvesting in it, isn’t it time to say the same regarding Value 2.0? In the end, whether Buffett “missed tech” or not is irrelevant. He has now all but removed himself from the great arena of the stock market, and the best requiem we can give him is to ask how we should proceed ourselves. The only thing more pitiful than hearing about “the next Warren Buffett” is hearing his disciples parroting Buffetisms as if were still 1967, 1987, or even 1997. Many of these disciples have failed to apply the maestro’s maxims to the present day’s radically altered business landscape. “My favorite holding period is forever,” Buffett has said, and it’s a good axiom—but should we be holding businesses like Coke and Wells Fargo, whose best days are likely behind them, or ones like Alphabet and Microsoft? “Price is what you pay, value is what you get,” Buffett has said, and that’s also true—but what does the saying mean in the context of a tech company’s ambitious spending and consequently high P/E ratio? Conversely, what does it mean for a business like Kraft Heinz, a Buffett holding that has systematically failed to reinvest and has thus systematically eroded its business value? Kraft Heinz has so thoroughly failed, in fact, that it’s resorting to the ultimate refuge of corporate scoundrels: a breakup. When I go to Berkshire meetings these days or am around value investors generally, I hear these axioms endlessly repeated, but with little thought to their contemporary meaning. It’s like members of an old, established religion mumbling a catechism without thinking about its relevance to their world today. Buffett and Munger never meant their wisdom to be suspended in amber. They were far more flexible and sophisticated thinkers than that. Value investors need to be, too. Fortunately, as the 21st century enters its second generation, more and more value investors are adapting their templates to a Value 3.0 world. For every holdout like David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who continues to rail against tech’s high valuations while owning coal miners and annuity companies, there are investors like Tom Gayner at Markel, Bill Nygren at Oakmark, and Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital. They have all used a value-based discipline to make successful investments in tech. My favorite is Lew Sanders, the former CEO of Value 1.0 paragon Sanford Bernstein. During the Great Financial Crisis, Sanders bought banks because they looked cheap using traditional value metrics. Many were in fact worthless, and Bernstein fired him. Forced to start over with his own firm, Sanders decided that the world had changed. He changed with it: His top positions now include Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet and Taiwan Semiconductor.

Title: Bitcoin’s $90K rejection: Is BTC's digital gold narrative losing to bonds?
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-90k-rejection-is-btc-digital-gold-narrative-losing-to-bonds
Time Published: 2025-12-30T10:40:43Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin's recovery relied on a shift toward the "digital gold" narrative, but global growth risks and strong equity markets have delayed that breakout. Cointelegraph in your social feed Key takeaways: Bitcoin failed to break $90,000 again as investors favored gold and bonds. S&P 500 record highs and lower interest rates have reduced Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge compared to traditional equities. Bitcoin (BTC) faced strong rejection near $90,000 on Monday, triggering nearly $100 million in liquidations across leveraged positions. Strong demand for traditional hedges such as gold and US government bonds led traders to question whether Bitcoin has the momentum needed to reclaim the $100,000 level. Gold prices held above $4,300 on Monday, while yields on the two-year US Treasury fell to their lowest level since August 2022. Rising demand for government-backed assets signals broader risk aversion, particularly as the US fiscal deficit is expected to widen in 2026. The US Treasury also faces the difficult task of rolling over roughly $10 trillion in debt throughout the year. Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer of the Rockefeller Global Family Office, told Reuters: Meanwhile, the negative impact of US import tariffs on economic growth has been offset by massive spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure, according to Yahoo Finance. Investor sentiment has deteriorated since the US Department of Labor reported the November US unemployment rate at 4.6%, the highest level in four years. Under normal circumstances, such data would lead traders to raise expectations for a more aggressive stimulus stance from the US Federal Reserve. But this time, inflation risks have become a significant constraint. Even so, the S&P 500 surged to a new all-time high in December, adding to discomfort among Bitcoin investors. If the Fed continues to trim interest rates, equities tend to move higher due to the direct impact on corporate balance sheets. Lower capital costs support higher valuations, while consumer credit conditions also improve. As a result, Bitcoin’s appeal as an independent hedge becomes less compelling. Bitcoin’s difficulty in holding the $90,000 level reflects traders’ risk perceptions, as the cryptocurrency has yet to establish itself as a reliable store of value amid a global recession. If investments in artificial intelligence deliver the expected returns, major tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT US), Nvidia (NVDA US) and Google (GOOG) could unlock additional valuation upside, potentially pushing equity markets to new all-time highs. Bitcoin mining has also moved into focus amid rising energy costs. Investors worry that miners are operating at extremely low, or even negative, margins. Tighter operating cash flows have pushed miners to rely more frequently on debt and equity-linked financing to maintain liquidity, including secondary share offerings. Meanwhile, the network hash rate has edged lower after peaking in late October. However, VanEck analysts argue that Bitcoin miner capitulation is “historically a bullish contrarian signal.” A report by VanEck crypto research lead Matt Sigel noted that Bitcoin’s 90-day forward returns have historically been positive 65% of the time following 30-day periods of network hashrate decline. The report attributed the recent drop in hash rate to the shutdown of 1.3 gigawatts of mining capacity in China. Related: Strategy’s latest 2025 Bitcoin purchase caps active year of accumulation Another factor behind investors’ reluctance to add exposure near the $87,000 level is the compression in valuation multiples among digital reserve asset companies. There is little incentive to issue shares below the market value of their underlying Bitcoin holdings. For example, Strategy (MSTR US) traded at a 16% discount, while Twenty One Capital (XXI US) was valued 18% below its reserves, according to BitcoinTreasuries. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s trajectory depends on a shift in risk perception that favors the digital gold narrative. This process may take longer as attention remains focused on global economic growth risks.

Title: Strategy stock bleeds as MSCI verdict nears – What next for MSTR?

MSCI delisting fears and stock dilution drags MSTR lower. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, saw its stock drop to a fresh yearly low. Following a broader tech sell-off on the 29th of December, MSTR stock dropped by 2.15% to a record 2025 low of $155.32. From its 2024 high of $543, MSTR has crashed by 71%, presenting several Wall Street bears with a windfall opportunity. Although some bears began unwinding short positions in November to realize their gains, MSTR’s free fall did not slow down. At press time, the stock was back within the 2024 price range of $100-$180. Source: MSTR, TradingView One of the factors driving bearish sentiment over the past few weeks has been the risk of MSCI index delisting MSTR and other crypto treasury firms. Although the Strategy founder, Michael Saylor, has defended the firm as an operational company that should remain on the global index, prediction site Polymarket was pricing a +75% chance of delisting in early 2026. JPMorgan analysts warned that such a move would drive $8 billion in outflows from the stock. Some even speculated that the delisting would force liquidation of its Bitcoin holdings, but market expectations for such a BTC sell-off remained low. The MSCI decision in mid-January could offer the needed clarity for the stock’s next direction. Additionally, the ongoing dilution through MSTR stock sales to fund Bitcoin [BTC] purchases may have contributed to the stock’s pressure. According to analyst Novacula Occami, Strategy sold $4 billion worth of MSTR despite its BTC holdings trading below its enterprise value, or mNAV, being below 1. “Since that July announcement, they’ve issued $4.9 billion of $MSTR common with $4 billion of that issued at a common mNAV below 1 (in Nov and Dec).” Source: X The firm had earlier stated that it wouldn’t sell the common stock (MSTR) if the mNAV fell below 2.5x, then changed it to 1x. Overall, Strategy has spent $22.5 billion to buy Bitcoin in 2025. This was nearly half of its +$50 billion investment in BTC since 2020. Source: CryptoQuant This has been funded by MSTR and preferred stock sales, as well as debt. In fact, the latest $108 million BTC buy was wholly funded by MSTR stock sales. Strategy now owns 672,497 BTC. That said, despite the massive dump in 2025, Wall Street analysts were still bullish on MSTR stock. There were 13 buy ratings in the past month, with price targets ranging from $465 to $485, implying a 170%-200% upside potential.

Title: The Economic Warning Sign Hiding Behind White-Collar Layoffs

White-collar layoffs at firms like McKinsey and Amazon grab headlines for their implications about artificial intelligence and tariff pressures replacing plum jobs. But there’s another canary in the economic coal mine. What PYMNTS Intelligence calls the Labor Economy® — the roughly 60 million warehouse packers, delivery drivers, home health aides, construction workers, groundskeepers, janitors, retail associates and other blue-collar workers who keep America running — is also sending up warning signals.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ With the holiday shopping season in full swing, nearly half of United States Labor Economy workers say they have little to no confidence they can afford to buy presents without going into debt until next summer. Only 1 in 3 who hadn’t started shopping by Dec. 10 said they planned to buy anything at all, compared to 46% of other consumers. Those data points, a supplement to PYMNTS’ latest installment of the Wage to Wallet® Index, suggest pocketbook tightening across a broad swath of America that may indicate deeper trouble ahead. PYMNTS defines Labor Economy workers as people earning under $25 an hour, or less than $50,000 per year. Comprising about one-third the total U.S. workforce, they drive 15% of consumer spending, making them a significant economic bloc. When they dial back their spending, the broader economy takes a hit, creating ripple effects at the businesses their spending supports. Even small interruptions — think missed work shifts, reduced hours or a late direct deposit — can instantly stymie these workers’ ability to pay rent, buy groceries, make debt payments and pay for childcare. PYMNTS estimates that a 0.13% increase in wages for this group in November translated into roughly $2.2 billion in additional annualized spending capacity. This scant increase hardly offsets the 0.8% loss in wages in October, equivalent to an annualized $14 billion hit to GDP. That’s what makes PYMNTS’s fresh data about their holiday spending telling. The financial strain of Labor Economy workers is an early warning signs about pressures on broader economic health that may not show up in traditional metrics for months. Nearly 6 in 10 of Labor Economy workers are relying on cash or debit cards for their holiday purchases—meaning for them that if the money’s not in the account, nothing’s getting bought. Only 15% are using credit cards with the intention to pay in full at the end of the monthly billing cycle, compared to 31% of everyone else. And 4 in 10 plan to spend less this holiday season. Just 19% expect to spend more. And for many of those who do plan to shop, the financial pain won’t end come New Year’s day. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Of these consumers, 1 in 5 expect their holiday debt to take more than six months to repay, a financial ball and chain they will drag into summer 2025. The percentage is one-third higher than for non-labor economy workers, who predominantly have steadier paychecks and better access to low-interest credit. The irony is stark: The very workers powering everyone else’s year-end shopping — packing boxes, driving delivery trucks, restocking shelves, caring for families — are the ones most likely to skip it entirely or pay for it well into next year. It all reflects what PYMNTS calls a mirror economy. Somewhat but not entirely like the K-shaped economy of high earners doing well financially and middle-income and low-income ones struggling, the mirror economy reflects a “split” reality, in which economic sentiment “mirrors” the specific structural constraints a particular group operating in. Non-Labor optimism reflects an economy defined by expanding options and credit leverage , while Labor Economy pessimism mirrors a parallel reality defined by tightening constraints and personal liquidity pressure. In other words, different groups experience different economies, not one single economy in different ways. As such, the Labor Economy sentiment index reflects an economy that is no longer moving in a single direction but instead splitting along a fault line shaped by access to credit, timing of receipt and perceived opportunity. This suggests optimism in today’s economy is shaped less by overall employment levels and more by the mechanics of monthly and sometimes daily cash flow.

Title: Top 10 Stories of 2025

Time Published: 2025-12-30T06:00:55Z

Each year, our most-read stories offer a snapshot of where the programmatic industry is at this moment. This year, programmatic companies faced tough decisions about privacy, awkward acquisitions and the cookie die-off that never quite happened. Programmatic is an industry that’s long past its youthful growth spurt and immaturity. Now it’s dealing with the discomfort of regulation and attention from lawmakers. While the programmatic web faced these tough decisions, connected TV felt the warm, golden glow of programmatic transformation. CTV represents an opportunity for programmatic natives and for streamers that haven’t fully embraced how data and automation can sweeten the revenue from their subscribers. Our top 10 stories highlighted programmatic growing pains, CTV’s evolution, how closely watched The Trade Desk continues to be and more. Here they are, starting at the top: 1. Google Is Found Guilty Of Operating An Ad Tech Monopoly (!) (April) Our top story of the year should come as no surprise to our readers. What happens to Google’s sell-side ads business affects everyone in the programmatic industry. The remedies to Google’s monopoly will have particular resonance among publishers and SSPs. The guilty verdict found that Google unlawfully tied its publisher ad server with its ad exchange, setting the stage for the remedies phase in the fall, when the judge decided what punishment to mete out to Google. 2. Microsoft Is Shutting Down Invest, The One-Time AppNexus DSP Business (May) Over the years, stories about AppNexus (later renamed Xandr, then Microsoft Invest) always ranked among the most popular AdExchanger stories – both because of its independent stance as a foil to Google and its attention-grabbing moves as a company. So it makes sense that the AppNexus DSP did not go quietly into the night. Industry leaders paid attention to what this shutdown means for the broader DSP and SSP space as well as Microsoft’s strategy. 3. The Trade Desk Is Acquiring Advertising Metadata Startup Sincera (January) The Trade Desk doesn’t make acquisitions. The Trade Desk doesn’t make acquisitions. The Trade Desk …. made an acquisition. TTD reversed its historically un-acquisitive approach this year and bought Sincera, known for gathering advertising metadata to stamp out fraud and help advertisers improve their decision-making. In the months since, Sincera’s co-founder Mike O’Sullivan has become a public-facing decision-maker and representative for the DSP, and Sincera’s tech has woven itself into the Trade Desk’s seller strategy. 4. The Record CCPA Fine Against Healthline Should Be A Wake-Up Call For Publishers (July) The specter of CCPA enforcement has loomed over the programmatic industry for years. And Healthline’s fine, the first one to hit a publisher, offered a concrete example of what media companies have to worry about it. Tracking pixels and cookies on the health publisher’s site, a common addition to publishers’ sites, could telegraph a person’s health status. For publishers that have long gathered behavioral data about users based on the type of articles they read, this fine signaled the types of behaviors being tracked – as well as tracking, period – are no longer in compliance with the law. 5, The Trade Desk Promises Big Changes After Missing Its Q4 Guidance (February) The Trade Desk has long been a darling of Wall Street. But when it missed its Q4 guidance at the beginning of this year, investors started to worry not just about The Trade Desk but publicly traded ad tech companies. The earnings miss kicked off a year of change and challenges at The Trade Desk, as it sought to get back on track and push the industry on issues like transparency and labeling resellers. Even so, it ended the year with layoffs. 6. As CTV Blooms, It’s Knives Out For The Trade Desk’s Take Rate (April) The Trade Desk also faced more competition this year. Amazon’s DSP is breaking out beyond its endemic commerce advertisers. And like Google and YouTube, Amazon is paired up with Prime Video, the AVOD-by-default platform brimming with scale and inventory. But that’s not the only CTV DSP in the mix. With a rundown on the competitive landscape of CTV DSPs, this story underlined the challenge of bringing programmatic tech to CTV. Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. 7. Meet The Netflix Ads Suite, Introduced By Ads VP Nicolle Pangis (March) After years of rumors, Netflix finally added an ad-supported subscription option. And the CTV industry wanted to know more. When Ads VP Nicolle Pangis appeared at CTV Connect this year, she revealed details about Netflix’s product road map and the product acronym, NAS, that will house the streamer’s ad tech ambitions. 8. Lawmakers Demand Answers From Ad Tech Vendors Allegedly Monetizing CSAM (February) The lack of transparency in ad tech has long meant advertisers buy ads in places where they don’t want them. But putting ads in illegal places, such as on CSAM, moves the conversation of “brand safety” into a different realm. When Adalytics discovered ads placed on illegal content earlier this year, lawmakers sent a letter to multiple ad tech companies demanding answers. 9. Google Isn’t Launching A User Choice Prompt For Third-Party Cookies In Chrome (April) For years, Google Chrome plotted a replacement to third-party cookies. Then it walked back that decision, validating the long-held industry skepticism around Google actually going through with that plan. Instead, Chrome was going to build its version of Apple ATT, the user choice prompt that asked users if they really, truly wanted cookies. Just kidding. Google wasn’t going to do that, either – a new story that was both a bombshell and the latest industry I-told-you-so. 10. The Ad Context Protocol Aims To Make Sense Of Agentic Ad Demand (October) How will ad tech change once agents enter the scene? It’s possible agents will negotiate campaign deals on behalf of clients. And AdCP, or Ad Context Protocol, is a new protocol that will standardize those interactions. The steady hum of traffic to this article post-publication speaks to the many minds figuring out the future of AI in digital ad transactions.

One time, a good friend of mine told me that the more I learned about finance, the more pissed off I’d get. He was right. There is an echoing melancholy to this era, as we watch the end of Silicon Valley’s hypergrowth era, the horrifying result of 15+ years of steering the tech industry away from solving actual problems in pursuit of eternal growth. Everything is more expensive, and every tech product has gotten worse, all so that every company can “do AI,” whatever the fuck that means. We are watching one of the greatest wastes of money in history, all as people are told that there “just isn’t the money” to build things like housing, or provide Americans with universal healthcare, or better schools, or create the means for the average person to accumulate wealth. The money does exist, it just exists for those who want to gamble — private equity firms, “business development companies” that exist to give money to other companies, venture capitalists, and banks that are getting desperate and need an overnight shot of capital from the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Repurchase Facility or Discount Window, two worrying indicators of bank stress I’ll get into later. No, the money does not exist for you or me or a person. Money is for entities that could potentially funnel more money into the economy, even if the ways that these entities use the money are reckless and foolhardy, because the system’s intent on keeping entities alive incentivizes it. We are in an era where the average person is told to pull up their bootstraps, to work harder, to struggle more, because, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, it’s socialism for the rich and rugged free market capitalism for the poor. The “free market” is a fucking con. When you or I run out of money, our things are taken from us, we receive increasingly-panicked letters, we get phone calls and texts and emails and demands, we are told that all will be lost if we don’t “work it out,” because the financial system is not about an exchange of value but whether or not you can enter into the currently agreed-upon con. By letting neoliberalism and the scourge of the free markets rule, modern society created the conditions for what I call The Enshittifinancial Crisis — the place at which my friend Cory Doctorow’s Enshittification Theory meets my own Rot Economy Thesis in a fourth stage of Enshittification. Per The New Yorker: I’ll walk you through it. Facebook was a huge, free platform, much like Instagram, that offered fast and easy access to everybody you knew. It acquired Instagram in 2012 to kill off a likely competitor, and over time would start making both products worse — clickbait notifications, a mandatory algorithmic feed that deliberately emotionally manipulated people and stoked political division, eventually becoming full of AI slop and videos, all so that Meta could continue to sell billions of dollars of ads a quarter. Per Kyle Chayka of the New Yorker, “Facebook’s feed, now choked with A.I.-generated garbage and short-form videos, is well into the third act of enshittification.” The third stage is critical, in that it’s when the company also turns on its business customers. A Marketing Brew story from September of last year told the tale of multiple advertisers who found their campaigns switching to different audiences, wasting their money and getting questionable results. A New York Times story from 2021 described companies losing upwards of 70% of their revenue during a Facebook ads outage, another from 2018 described how Meta (then Facebook) deliberately hid issues with its measurement of engagement on videos from advertisers for over a year, and more recently, Meta’s ads tools started switching out top-performing ads with AI-generated ones, in one case targeting men aged 30 to 45 with an AI-generated grandma, all without warning the advertiser. Meta doesn’t give a shit, because investors and analysts don’t give a shit. I could say “sell-side analysts” here — the ones that are trying to get you to buy a stock — but based on every analyst report I’ve read from a major bank or hedge fund, I truly think everybody is complicit. In November 2025, Reuters revealed that Meta projected in late 2024 that 10% of its annual revenue ($16 billion) would come from advertisements for scams or banned goods, mere weeks after Meta announced a ridiculous $27 billion data center debt package, one that used deep accountancy magic to keep it off of its balance sheet despite Meta guaranteeing the entirety of the loan. One would think this would horrify investors for two reasons: One would be wrong. Morgan Stanley said a few weeks ago that it is “one of the handful of companies that can leverage its leading data, distribution and investments in AI,” and raised its target to $750, with a $1000-a-share bull case. Wedbush raised Meta’s price to $920, and Bank of America staunchly held firm at…$810. I can find no analyst commentary on Meta making sixteen billion dollars on fraud, because it doesn’t matter to them, because this is the Rot Economy, and all that matters is number go up. Reality — such as whether there’s any revenue in AI, or whether it’s a good idea that Meta is spending over $70 billion this year on capital expenditures on a product that has generated no revenue (and please, fucking spare me the bullshit around “Meta’s AI ads play,” that whole story is nonsense) — doesn’t matter to analysts, because stocks are thoroughly, inextricably enshittified, and analysts don’t even realize it’s happening. The stages of enshittification usually involve some sort of devil’s deal. We have now entered Enshittification Stage 4, where businesses turn on shareholders. Analysts and investors have become trapped in the same kind of loathsome platform play as consumers and businesses, and face exactly the same kinds of punishment through the devaluation of the stock itself. Where platforms have prioritized profits over the health and happiness of users or business customers, they are now prioritizing stock value over literally anything, and have — through the remarkable growth of tech stocks in particular — created a placated and thoroughly whipped investor and analyst sect that never asks questions and always celebrates whatever the next big thing is meant to be. The value of a “stock” is not based on whether the business is healthy, or its future certain, but on its potential price to grow, and analysts have, thanks to an incredible bull run of tech stocks going on over a decade, been able to say “I bet software will be big” for most of the time, going on CNBC or Bloomberg and blandly repeating whatever it is that a tech CEO just said, all without any worries about “responsibility” or “the truth.” This is because big tech stocks — and many other big stocks, if I’m honest — have made their lives easy as long as they don’t ask questions. Number always seems to be going up for software companies, and all you need to do is provide a vociferous defense of the “next big thing,” and come up with a smart-sounding model that justifies eternal growth. This is entirely disconnected from the products themselves, which don’t matter as long as Number Go Up. If net income is high and the company estimates it will continue to grow, then the company can do whatever the fuck it want with the product it sells or the things that it buys. Software Has Eaten The World in the sense that Andreesen got his wish, with investors now caring more about the “intrinsic value” of software companies rather than the businesses or products themselves. And because that’s happening, investors aren’t bothering to think too hard about the tech itself, or the deteriorating products underlying tech companies, because “these guys have always worked it out” and “these companies have always managed to keep growing.” As a result, nobody really looks too deep. Minute changes to accounting in earnings filings are ignored, egregious amounts of debt are waved off, and hundreds of billions of dollars of capital expenditures are seen as “the new AI revolution” versus “a huge waste of money.” By incentivizing the Rot Economy — making stocks disconnected from the value of the company beyond net income and future earnings guidance — companies have found ways to enshittify their own stocks, and shareholders will be the ones who suffer, all thanks to the very downstream pressure that they’ve chosen to ignore for decades. You see, while one might (correctly) see that the deterioration of products like Facebook and Google Search was a sign of desperation, it’s important to also see it as the companies themselves orienting around what they believe analysts and investors want to see. You can also interpret this as weakness, but I see it another way: stock manipulation, and a deliberate attempt to reshape what “value” means in the eyes of customers and investors. If the true value of a stock is meant to be based on the value of its business, cash flow, earnings and future growth, a company deliberately changing its products is an intentional interference with value itself, as are any and all deceptive accounting practices used to boost valuations. But the real problem is that analysts do not…well…analyze, not, at least, if it goes against the market consensus. That’s why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Futurum and Gartner and Forrester and McKinsey and Morgan Stanley all said that the metaverse was inevitable — because they do not actually care about the underlying business itself, just its ability to grow on paper. Need proof that none of these people give a fuck about actual value? Mark Zuckerberg burned $77 billion on the metaverse, creating little revenue or shareholder value and also burning all that money without any real explanation as to where it went. The street didn’t give a shit because meta’s existent ads business continued to grow, same as it didn’t give a shit that Mark Zuckerberg burned $70 billion on capex, even though we also really don’t know where that went either. In fact, we really have no idea where all this AI spending is going. These companies don’t tell us anything. They don’t tell us how many GPUs they have, or where those GPUs are, or how many of them are installed, or what their capacity is, or how much money they cost to run, or how much money they make. Why would we? Analysts don’t even look at earnings beyond making sure they beat on estimates. They’ve been trained for 20 years to take a puddle-deep look at the numbers to make sure things look okay, look around their peers and make sure nobody else is saying something bad, and go on and collect fees. The same goes for hedge funds and banks propping up these stocks rather than asking meaningful questions or demanding meaningful answers. In the last two years, every major hyperscaler has extended the “useful life” of its servers from 3 years to either 5.5 or 6 years — and in simple terms, this allowed them to incur a smaller depreciation expense each quarter as a result, boosting net income. Those who are meant to be critical — analysts and investors sinking money into these stocks — had effectively no reaction, despite the fact that Meta used (per the Wall Street Journal) this adjustment to reduce its expenses by $2.3 billion in the first three quarters of this year. This is quite literally disconnected from reality, and done based on internal accounting that we are not party to. Every single tech firm buying GPUs did this and benefited to the tune of billions of dollars in decreased revenues, and analysts thought it was fine and dandy because number went up. Shareholders are now subordinate to the shares themselves, reacting in the way that the shares demand they do, being happy for what the companies behind the shares give them, and analysts, investors and even the media spend far more energy fighting the doubters than they do showing these companies scrutiny. Much like a user of an enshittified platform, investors and analysts are frogs in a pot, the experience of owning a stock deteriorating since Jack Welch and GE taught corporations that the markets are run with the kind of simplistic mindset built for grifter exploitation. And much like those platforms, corporations have found as many ways as possible to abuse shareholders, seeing what they can get away with, seeing how far they can push things as long as the numbers look right, because analysts are no longer looking for sensible ideas. Let me give you an example I’ve used before. Back in November 1998, Winstar Communications signed a “$2 billion equipment and finance agreement with Lucent Technologies” where Winstar would borrow money from Lucent to buy stuff from Lucent, all to create $100 million in revenue over 5 years. In December 1999, Barron’s wrote a piece called “In 1999 Tech Ruled”: Airnet? Bankrupt. WinStar? Horribly bankrupt. While Ciena survived, it had spent over a billion dollars to acquire other companies (all stock, of course), only to see its revenue dwindle basically overnight from $1.6bn to $300 million as the optical cable industry collapsed. One would have been able to work out that Winstar was a dog, or that all of these companies were dogs, if you were to look at the numbers, such as “how much they made versus how much they were spending.” Instead, analysts, the media and banks chose to pump up these stocks because the numbers kept getting bigger, and when the collapse happened, rationalizations were immediately created — there were a few bad apples (Enron, Winstar, WorldCom), “the fiber was useful” and thus laying it was worthwhile, and otherwise everything was fine. The problem, in everybody else’s mind, was that everybody had got a bit distracted and some companies that weren’t good would die. All of that lost money was only a problem because it didn’t pay off. This was a misplaced gamble, and it taught tech executives one powerful lesson: earnings must be good, without fail, by any means necessary, and otherwise nothing else matters to Wall Street. It’s all about incentives. A sell-side analyst that tells you not to buy something is a problem. A journalist that is skeptical or critical of an industry in the midst of a growth or hype cycle is considered a “hater” — don’t I fucking know it. Analysts that do not sing the same tune as everybody else are marginalized, mocked and aggressively policed. And I don’t fucking care. Stop being fucking cowards. By not being skeptical or critical you are going to lead regular people into the jaws of another collapse. The dot com bubble was actually a great time to start reevaluating how and why we value stocks — to say “hey, wait, that $2 billion deal will only make $100 million in revenue?” or “this company spends $5 for every $1 it makes!” — but nobody, it appears, remained particularly suspicious of the tech industry, or a stock market that was increasingly orienting itself around conning shareholders. And because shareholders, analysts and the media alike refused to retain a single shred of suspicion leaving the dot com era, the mania never actually subsided. Financial publications still found themselves dedicated to explaining why the latest hype cycle was real. Journalists still found themselves told by editors that they had to cover the latest fad, even if it was nonsensical or clearly rotten. Analysts still grabbed their swords and rushed to protect the very companies that have spent decades misleading them. Much like we spent years saying that Facebook was a “good deal” because it was free, analysts and investors say tech stocks are “great to hold” because they kept growing, even if the reason they “kept growing” was a series of interlocking monopolies, difficult-to-leave platforms and impossible-to-fight traction and pricing, all of which have an eventual sell-by date. I realize I’m pearl-clutching over the amoral status of capitalism and the stock market, but hear me out: what if we’re actually in a 15-to-20-year-long knife-catching competition? What if all anybody has done is look at cashflow, net income, future growth guidance, and called it a day? A lack of scrutiny has allowed these companies to do effectively anything they want, bereft of worrisome questions like "will this ever make a profit?" What if we basically don’t know what the fuck is going on? What if all of this was utterly senseless? As I wrote last year, the tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, facing something I call “the Rot Com bubble.” In simple terms, they’re only “doing AI” because there do not appear to be any other viable ideas to continue the Rot Economy’s eternal growth-at-all-costs dance. Yet because growth hasn’t slowed yet, analysts, the media and other investors are quick to claim that AI is “paying off,” even if nobody has ever said how much AI revenue is being generated or, in the case of Salesforce, they can say “nearly $1.4 billion ARR,” which sounds really big until you realize a company with $10.9 billion in revenue is boasting about making less than $116 million in revenue in a month. Nevertheless, because Salesforce set a new revenue target of $60 billion by 2030, the stock jumped 4%. It doesn’t matter that most Agentforce customers don’t pay for the service, or that AI isn’t really making much money, or really anything, other than Number Go Up. The era we live in is one of abject desperation, to the point that analysts and investors — and shareholders by extension — will take any abuse from management. They will allow companies to spend as much money as they want in whatever ways they want, as long as it continues the charade of “number go up.” Let me spell it out a little more, using the latest earnings of various hyperscalers as an example. We have no idea, because analysts and investors are in an abusive relationship with tech stocks. It is fundamentally insane that Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have spent $776 billion in capital expenditures in the space of three years, and even more so that analysts and investors, when faced with such egregious numbers, simply sit back and say “they’re building the infrastructure of the future, baby!” Analysts and traders and investors and reporters do not think too hard about the underlying numbers, because doing so immediately makes you run head-first into a number of worrying questions such as “where did all that money go?” and “will any of this pay off?” and “how many GPUs do they actually own?” Analysts have, on some level, become the fractional marketing team for the stocks they’re investing in. When Oracle announced its $300 billion deal with OpenAI in September — one that Oracle does not have the capacity to fill and OpenAI does not have the money to pay for – analysts heaved and stammered like horny teenagers seeing their first boob: These are the same people that retail and institutional investors rely upon for advice on what stocks to buy, all acting with the disregard for the truth that comes from years of never facing a consequence. Three months later, and Oracle has lost basically all of the stock bump it saw from the OpenAI deal, meaning that any retail investor that YOLO’d into the trade because, say, analysts from major institutions said it was a good idea and news outlets acted like this deal was real, already got their ass kicked. And please, spare me the “oh they shouldn’t trade off of analysts” bullshit. That’s the kind of victim-blaming that allows these revered fuckwits to continue farting out these meaningless calls. In reality, we’re in an era of naked, blatant, shameless stock manipulation, both privately and publicly, because a “stock” no longer refers to a unit of ownership in a company so much as it is a chip at a casino where the house constantly changes the rules. Perhaps you’re able to occasionally catch the house showing its hand, and perhaps the house meant for you to see it. Either way, you are always behind, because the people responsible for buying and selling stocks at scale under the auspices of “knowing what’s going on” don’t seem to know what they’re talking about, or don’t care to find out. Let’s walk through the latest surge of blatant stock manipulation, and how the media and analysts helped it happen. Oracle announces its unfillable, unpayable $300 billion deal with OpenAI, leading to 30%+ bump in stock price. Analysts, who should ostensibly be able to count, call it “momentous” and say they’re “in shock.” On September 22 2025, CEO Safra Catz steps down, and nobody seems to think that’s weird or suspicious. Two months later, Oracle’s stock is down 40%, with investors worried about Oracle’s growing capex, which is surprising I suppose if you didn’t think about how Oracle would build the fucking data centers. Basically anyone who traded into this got burned. NVIDIA announced a “strategic partnership” to invest “up to $100 billion” and build 10GW of data centers with OpenAI, with the first gigawatt to be deployed in the second half of 2026. Where would the data centers go? How would OpenAI afford to build them? How would OpenAI build a gigawatt in less than a year? Don’t ask questions, pig! NVIDIA’s stock bumped from from $175.30 to $181 in the space of a day. The media wrote about the story as if the deal was done, with CNBC claiming that “the initial $10 billion tranche [was] expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized.” I read at least ten stories that said that “NVIDIA had invested $100 billion.” Analysts would say that NVIDIA was “locking in OpenAI” to “remain the backbone of the next-gen AI infrastructure,” that “demand for NVIDIA GPUs is effectively baked into the development of frontier AI models,” that the deal “[strengthened] the partnership between the two companies…[and] validates NVIDIA’s long-term growth numbers with so much volume and compute capacity.” Others would say that NVIDIA was “enabling OpenAI to meet surging demand.” Three analysts — Rasgon at Bernstein, Luria at D.A. Davidson and Wagner at Aptus Capital — all raised circular deal concerns, but they were the minority, and those concerns were still often buried under buoyant optimism about the prospects of the company. One eensy weensy problem though, everyone! This was a “letter of intent” — it said so in the announcement! — and on NVIDIA’s November earnings, it said that it “entered into a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest in OpenAI.” It turns out the deal didn’t exist and everybody fell for it! NVIDIA hasn’t sent a dime and likely won’t. A letter of intent is a “concept of a plan.” Back in October, Reuters reported that Samsung and SK Hynix had "signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers," with South Korea's presidential office saying that said chip demand was expected to reach "900,000 wafers a month," with "much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix," which was quickly extrapolated to mean around 40% of global DRAM output. Stocks in both companies, to quote Reuters, “soared,” with Samsung climbing 4% and SK Hynix more than 12% to an all-time high. Analyst Jeff Kim of KB Securities said that “there have been worries about high bandwidth memory prices falling next year on intensifying competition, but such worries will be easily resolved by the strategic partnership,” adding that “Since Stargate is a key project led by President Trump, there also is a possibility the partnership will have a positive impact on South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S.” Donald Trump is not “leading Stargate.” Stargate is a name used to refer to data centers built by OpenAI. KB Securities has around $43 billion of assets under management. This is the level of analysis you get from these analysts! This is how much they know! On SK Hynix's October 29 2025 earnings call, weeks after the announcement, its CEO, Kim Woo-Hyun, was asked a question about High Bandwidth Memory growth by SK Kim from Daiwa Securities: This is the only mention of OpenAI. Otherwise, SK Hynix has not added any guidance that would suggest that its DRAM sales will spike beyond overall growth, other than mentioning it had "completed year 2026 supply discussions with key customers." There is no mention of OpenAI in any earnings presentation. On Samsung's October 30 2025 earnings call, Samsung mentioned the term "DRAM" 18 times, and neither mentioned OpenAI nor any letters of intent. In its Q3 2025 earnings presentation, Samsung mentions it will "prioritize the expansion of the HBM4 [high bandwidth memory 4] business with differentiated performance to address increasing AI demand." Analysts do not appear to have noticed a lack of revenue from an apparent deal for 40% of the world’s RAM! Oh well! Pobody’s nerfect! Both Samsung and SK Hynix’s stocks have continued to rise since, and you’d be forgiven for thinking this deal was something to do with it, even though it wasn’t. AMD announced that it had entered a “multi-year, multi-generation agreement” with OpenAI to build 6 GW of data centers, with “the first 1GW deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026,” calling the agreement “definitive” with terms that allowed OpenAI to buy up to 10% of AMD’s stock, vesting over “specific milestones” that started with the first gigawatt of data center development. Said data centers would also use AMD’s yet-to-be-released MI450 GPUs. The deal would, per Reuters, bring in “tens of billions of dollars of revenue.” Where would those data centers go? How would OpenAI pay for them? Would the chips be ready in time? Silence, worm! How dare you ask questions? How dare you? Why are you asking questions? NUMBER GO UP! AMD’s shares surged by 34%, with analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush saying that this was a “major valuation moment” for AMD. As an aside, Ives said that NVIDIA would benefit from the metaverse in 2021, and told CBS News in November 22 2021 that “the metaverse [was] real and Wall Street [was] looking for winners.” One would think that AMD’s November earnings — a month after the announcement — might be a barn-burner full of remaining performance obligations from OpenAI. In fact, CEO Lisa Su said that “[AMD expected] this partnership will significantly accelerate [its] data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100 billion in revenue over the next few years.” Here’s how AMD’s 10-Q filing referred to it: …so, no revenue from OpenAI at all, I guess? AMD raised guidance by 35% over the next five years AMD's trailing 12-month revenue is $32 billion. "Tens of billions of dollars" would surely lead to more than a 35% boost (an increase of $11.2 billion or so) in the next five years? Guess all of that was for nothing. No follow-up from the media, no questions from analysts, just a shrug and we all move on. Anyway, AMD’s stock is now down from a high of $259 at the end of October to around $214 as of writing this sentence. Everybody who traded in based on analyst and media comments got fucked. So, back on September 5, Broadcom said on its earnings call that it had a $10 billion order from a mystery customer, which analysts quickly assumed was OpenAI, leading to the stock popping 9%, and gradually increasing to a high of $369 or so on September 10, before declining a little until October 13, when Broadcom announced its ridiculous 10 gigawatt deal with OpenAI, claiming that it would deploy 10GW of OpenAI-designed chips, with the first racks to deploy the second half of 2026 and the entire deployment completed by end of 2029. The same day, its president of semiconductor solutions Charlie Kawwas added that said mystery customer was actually somebody else: Nevertheless, Broadcom's stock popped by 9% on the news about the 10GW deal, with CNBC adding that "the companies have been working together for 18 months." Because it's OpenAI, nobody sat and thought about whether somebody at Broadcom saying "well, OpenAI has yet to order these chips yet" was a problem. In fact, the answer to “how does OpenAI afford this?” appeared to be “they’d afford it” when it came to analysts: Not to worry, OpenAI’s solution was far simpler: it didn’t order any chips. During Broadcom's November earnings call, where Broadcom revealed that the $10 billion order was actually from Anthropic, another LLM startup that burns billions of dollars, which was buying Google's TPUs, and also booked another $11 billion in orders. Analysts somehow believed that Anthropic is “positioned to spend heavily” despite being another venture-backed welfare recipient in the same flavor as OpenAI. Oh, right, that 10GW OpenAI deal. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that he did “not expect much in 2026” from the deal, and guidance did not change to reflect it. Broadcom climbed to a high of $412 leading up to its earnings, and I imagine it did so based on people trading on the belief that OpenAI and Broadcom were doing a deal together, which does not appear to be happening. While there’s an alleged $73 billion backlog, every dollar from Anthropic is questionable. Actually, yes we can. Whenever a company says “letter of intent” — as NVIDIA and SK Hynix/Samsung did — it’s important to immediately stop taking the deal seriously until you get the word “contract” involved. Not “agreement” or “deal” or “announcement,” but “contract,” because contracts are the only thing that actually matters. Similarly, it’s time for everybody — analysts, the media, members of congress, the fucking pope, I don’t care — to start treating these companies with suspicion, and to start demanding timelines. NVIDIA and Microsoft announced their $15 billion investment in Anthropic over a month ago. Where’s the money? Why does the agreement say “up to $10 billion” for NVIDIA and “up to $5 billion” from Microsoft? These subtle details suggest that the deal is not going to be for $15 billion, and the lack of activity suggests it might not happen at all. These deals are announced with the intention of suggesting there is more revenue and money in generative AI than actually exists. Furthermore, it is irresponsible and actively harmful for analysts and the media to continually act as if these deals will actually get paid when you consider the financial conditions of these companies. As part of its alleged funding announcement with NVIDIA and Microsoft, Anthropic agreed to purchase $30 billion of Azure compute. It also agreed to spend "tens of billions of dollars" with Google Cloud. It ordered $10 billion in chips from Broadcom earlier in the year, and apparently placed another $11 billion order in its latest fiscal quarter. How does it pay for those? It allegedly will burn $2.8 billion this year (I believe it burned much, much more) and raised $16.5 billion in funding (before Microsoft and NVIDIA’s involvement, which we cannot confirm has actually happened). How are investors tolerating Broadcom not directly stating “the future financial condition of this company is questionable”? Has Broadcom created a reserve for this deal? If not, why not? Anthropic will make no more than $5 billion this year, and has raised $17.5bn (with a further $2.5bn coming in the form of debt). How can it foreseeably afford to pay $10 billion, or $11 billion, or $21 billion, considering its already massive losses and all those other obligations mentioned? Will Jensen Huang hand over $10 billion so that Anthropic can hand it to Broadcom? I realize the counter-argument is that companies aren’t responsible for their counterparties’ financial health, but my argument is that it’s the responsibility of any public company to give a realistic view of its financial health, which includes noting if a chunk of its revenue is from a startup that can’t afford to pay for its orders. There is no counter to that! Anthropic cannot afford to pay Broadcom $10 billion right now! Nevertheless, the problem is that in any bubble, being really stupid and ignorant works right up until it doesn’t, and however harsh the dot com bubble might have been, it wasn’t harsh enough and those who were responsible were left unpunished and unashamed, guaranteeing that this cycle would happen again. I want to be really, abundantly clear about what’s happening: every single stock you see “growing because of AI” outside of those selling RAM and GPUs is actually growing because of something else. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta all have other products that are making them money. AI is not doing it, and because analysts and investors do not think about things for two seconds, they have allowed themselves to be beaten down and turned into supplicants for public stocks. Investors have allowed themselves to be played, and the results will be worse than the dot com bubble bursting by several echelons. I’m gonna be really simplistic for a second. I am skeptical of AI because everybody loses money. I believe every AI company is unprofitable with margins that are getting increasingly worse as they scale, and as a result that none of them will be able to either get acquired or go public. This means that venture capitalists that have sunk money into AI stocks are going to be sitting on a bunch of assets under management (AUM) — the same assets they collect fees on — that will eventually crater or go to zero, because there will be no way for any liquidity event to occur. This is at a time of historically-low liquidity for venture capitalists, with Pitchbook estimating there will only be $100.8 billion in venture capital funds available at the end of 2025. Venture capitalists raise money from limited partners, who invest in venture capital with the hope of returns that outpace investing in the public markets. Venture capital vastly overinvested during 2021 and 2022, This was also a problem in private equity. In simple terms, this means these funds are sitting on tons of stock that they cannot shift, and the longer it takes for a company to either go public or acquired, the more likely it is the VC or PE firm will have to mark down its value. This is so bad that according to Carta, as of August 2024, less than 10% of VC funds raised in 2021 have made any distributions to their investors. In a piece from September, Carta revealed that “about 15% of funds” from 2023 have generated any disbursements as of Q2 2025, and the median net internal rate of return was a median 0.1%, meaning that, at best, most investors got their money back and absolutely nothing else. In fact, investing in venture capital has kinda fucking sucked. According to Carta, “As of the end of Q2, most VC funds across all recent vintages had a TVPI somewhere between 0.8x and 2x. But there are some areas where standout TVPIs are surfacing.” TVPI means Total Value To Paid-in Capital, or the amount of money you made for each dollar invested. This chart may seem confusing, it tells you that for the most part, VCs have struggled to provide even money returns since 2017. A “decent” TVPI is 2.5x, and as you’ll see, things have effectively collapsed since 2021. Companies are not going public or being acquired at the same rate, meaning that investor capital is increasingly locked up, meaning that limited partners are still waiting for a payoff from the last bubble, let alone this one. Carta would update the piece in December 2025, and things would somehow get worse. TVPI soured further, suggesting a further lack of exits across the board. The only slight improvement was the median IRR rose to 0.5% for funds from 2021 and 0.1% for funds from 2022. In simple terms, we are looking at years of locked-up capital leaving venture capital cash-starved and a little desperate. The worst part? All of this is happening during a generational increase in the amounts that startups need to raise thanks to the ruinous costs of generative AI, and the negative margins of AI-powered services. To quote myself: None of these companies are profitable, nor do they have any path to an acquisition or IPO. Why? Because even the most advanced AI software company is ultimately prompting Anthropic or OpenAI’s models, meaning that their only real intellectual property is those prompts and their staff, and whatever they can build around the models they don’t control, which has been obvious from the meager “acquisitions” we’ve seen so far. Windsurf, which was allegedly being sold to OpenAI, ended up selling its assets to Cognition in July, with Google paying $2.4 billion for its co-founders and a “licensing agreement,” similar to its acquisition of Character.Ai, where it paid $2.7 billion to rehire Noam Shazeer, license its tech, and pay off the stock of its remaining staff. This is also exactly what Microsoft did with Inflection AI and its co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. OpenAI’s acquisitions of Statsig ($1.1bn), Io Products ($6.5bn) and Neptune ($400m) were all-stock. Every other acquisition — Wiz, Confluent, Informatica, and so on (CRN has a great list here) — is either somebody trying to pretend that (for example) Wiz is related to AI, or trying to say that a data streaming platform is AI-related because AI needs that, which may be true, but doesn’t mean that any AI startups are actually selling. And they’re not, which is a problem, as 41% of US venture dollars in 2025 have gone into AI as of August, and according to Axios, the global number was around 51%. A crisis is brewing. Nerdlawyer, back in October, wrote about the explosive growth of secondary markets: In simpler terms, there are now Hot Potato Funds, where either another limited partner buys another one’s allocation, the companies themselves buy back their stock, or the stock is resold to other private investors. While this piece frames this as a positive, the reality is far grimmer. Venture capitalists are sitting on piles of immovable equity in companies worth far less than they invested at, and the answer, it appears, is to find somebody else to buy the dead weight. According to Newcomer, only 1117 venture funds closed in 2025 (down from 2100 in 2024), and 43% of dollars raised went to the largest venture funds, per The New York Times and PitchBook, suggesting limited partners are becoming less-interested in pumping cash into the system at a time when AI startups are demanding more capital than has ever been raised. How long can the venture capital industry keep handing out $100 million to $500 million to multiple startups a year? Because all signs suggest that the current pace of funding must continue in perpetuity, as nobody appears to have worked out that generative AI is inherently unprofitable, and thus every single company is on the Silicon Valley Welfare System until everybody gives up, or the system itself cannot sustain the pressure. I’ve read too many people make off-handed comments about this “being like the dot com boom” and saying that “lots of startups might die but what’s left over will be good,” and I hate them for both their flippancy and ignorance. None of the current stack of AI companies can survive on their own, meaning that the venture capital industry is holding them up. If even one of these companies falters and dies, the entire narrative will die. If that happens, it will be harder for AI companies to raise, and even harder to sell an AI company to someone else. This is a punishment for a decade-plus of hubris, where companies were invested in without ever considering a path to profitability. Venture capital has made the same mistake again and again, believing that because Uber, or Facebook, or Airbnb, or any number of companies founded nearly twenty years ago were unprofitable (with paths to profitability in all three cases, mind), it was totally okay to keep pumping up companies that had no path to profitability, which eventually became “had no apparent business model” (see: the metaverse, web3), which eventually became “have negative margins so severe and valuations so high that we will need an IPO at a market cap higher than Netflix.” This is Silicon Valley’s Rot Economy — the desperate, growth-at-all-costs attachment to startups where you “really like the founder,” where “the market could be huge” (who knows if it is!), where you just don’t need to worry about profitability because IPOs and exits were easy. Venture capital also used to be easy, because we were still in the era of hypergrowth. You could be a stupid asshole that doesn’t know anything, but there were so many good deals, and the more well-known you were, the more likely you’d be brought them first, guaranteeing a bigger payout, guaranteeing more LP capital, guaranteeing more opportunities that were of a higher quality because you were a big name. It was easier to make a valuable company, easier to get funded, and easier to sell, because the goal was always “get funded, grow as large an audience as possible, or go public/get acquired.” As a result, venture capital encouraged growth-at-all-costs thinking. In 2010, Ben Horwitz said that “the only thing worse for an entrepreneur than start-up hell (bankruptcy) is start-up purgatory”: This poisonous theory paid off, in that startups got used to building high-growth, low-margin companies that would easily sell to other companies or the markets themselves. Until it didn’t, of course. Per Nerdlawyer, IPOs have collapsed as an exit route, along with easy-to-raise capital. Per PitchBook, since 2022, 70% of VC-backed exits were valued at less than the capital put in, with more than a third of them being startups buying other startups in 2024. The money is drying up as the value of VCs’ assets is decreasing, at a time when VCs need more money than ever, because everybody is heavily leveraged in the single-most-expensive funding climate in history. And as we hit this historic liquidity crisis, the two largest companies — OpenAI and Anthropic — are becoming drains on the system that, in a very real sense, are participating in a massive redistribution of capital reserved for startups to one of a few public companies. No, really! OpenAI is trying to raise as much as $100 billion in funding so it can continue to pass money to one of a few public companies — $38 billion to Amazon Web Services over seven years, $22.4 billion to CoreWeave over five years, and $250 billion over an indeterminate period on Microsoft Azure. If successful, OpenAI’s venture telethon will raise more money than has ever been raised in a single round, draining funds that actual startups need. Anthropic has agreed to $70 billion in compute and chip deals across Google, Amazon and Broadcom, and that’s not including the Hut8 compute deal that Google is backing. This money will come from what remains of venture capital, private equity and hyperscaler generosity. Yet elsewhere, even the money that goes to regular startups is ultimately being sent to hyperscalers. That AI startup that needs to keep raising $100 million in a single round isn’t sending that cash to other startups — it’s mostly going to OpenAI (Microsoft, Amazon, CoreWeave, Google), Anthropic (Google, Microsoft, Amazon), or one of the large hyperscalers for Azure, AWS or Google Cloud. Silicon Valley didn’t birth the next big tech firm. It incubated yet another hyperscaler-level parasite, except instead of just spending money on hyperscaler services (and raising money to do so), both Anthropic and OpenAI actively drain the venture capital system as well, as they both burn billions of dollars. By creating something that’s incredibly expensive to run, they naturally create startups more-dependent on the venture capital system, and the venture capital system has no idea what to do other than say “just grow, baby!” Both OpenAI and Anthropic’s models might be getting cheaper on a per-million-token basis, but use more tokens, increasing the cost of inference, which in turn increases the costs of startups doing business, which in turn means OpenAI, Anthropic, and all connected startups lose more money, which increases the burn on venture capital. This is a doom-spiral, one that can only be reversed through the most magical and aggressive turnaround we will have seen in history, and it will have to happen next year, without fail. It won’t. So why did venture do this? Folks, we haven’t seen values this big in a long time. These are the biggest numbers we’ve ever seen. They’re simply tremendous. OpenAI is maybe worth $830 billion dollars, can you believe that? They lose so much money but folks we don’t worry about that, because they’re growing so fast. We love that Clammy Sam Altman — they call him “Clamuel” — tells everybody he’s giving them one billion dollars. Data centers are going to have the biggest deals we’ve ever seen, even [tchhh sound through teeth] if we have to work with Dario. You see, right now AI startups are big, exciting news for the limited partners funding LLM firms. Things feel exciting because the value of the assets under management (AUM) are going up, which is nothing dodgy, but just how VCs value things and if they are valuing AI stocks, that is how their fees are paid. Investing early in OpenAI allows a VC — or even an asset manager like Blackstone, which invested in 2024 — to say it has a big holding and a big increase in its AUM. We are currently in the sowing stage. Nevertheless, AI stocks make VCs who bet on them two years ago look like geniuses on paper. You got in early on OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Cognition, Perplexity or any other company that loves to burn several dollars per dollar of revenue, you have a big, beautiful number, the biggest you’ve ever seen, and your limited partners need to pay you a fee just to manage it. Venture capital hasn’t seen valuations like this in a long time, and on paper, it feels like a lot of VCs got in on companies worth billions of dollars. On paper, Cognition is worth $10.2 billion, Perplexity $18 billion, Cursor $29.3 billion, Lovable $6.6 billion, Cohere $6.8 billion, Replit $3 billion, and Glean $7.2 billion — massive valuations for companies that all basically do products that OpenAI or Anthropic or Amazon or Google or any number of Chinese companies are already working to clone. They are all losing tons of money and have no path to profitability. But right now the numbers are simply tremendous. I’ve heard venture capitalists tell me that there are times when they have to agree to invest with little to no information or know that they’ll lose the opportunity to another sucker investor. I’ve heard venture capitalists say they don’t have any insight into finances. Venture capitalists would, of course, claim I’m insane, saying that the “growth is obviously there” while pointing to whatever startup has made $100 million ARR ($8.3 million in a month), all while not discussing the underlying operating expenses. The idea, I believe, is that the current spate of AI spending is only set to increase next year, and that will…somehow lead to fixing margins? Venture capitalists staunchly refuse to learn anything other than “invest in growth and then profit from growth,” even if “profiting from growth” doesn’t seem to be happening anymore. In reality, venture capital shouldn’t have touched LLMs with a fifteen foot pole, because the margins were obviously, blatantly bad from the very beginning. We knew OpenAI would lose $5 billion in the middle of 2024. A sane venture capital climate would have fucking panicked, but instead chose to double, triple and quadruple down. I believe that massive valuation drawdowns are a certainty. There are losses coming. Venture capitalists, I have to ask you: what happens if OpenAI dies? Do you think that this will make investors interested in funding or acquiring other AI startups? How much longer are we going to do this? When will venture capital realize it’s setting itself up for disaster? And what, exactly, is the plan? OpenAI and Anthropic will suck the lakes dry like an NVIDIA GPU named after Nancy Reagan. How is this meant to continue, and what will be left when it does? The answer is simple: there won’t be money for venture capital for a while. Those AI holdings are going to be worth, at best, 50%, if they retain any value at all. Once one of these startups die, a panic will ensue, sending venture capitalists scrambling to get their holdings acquired, until there’s little or no investor interest left. Why would LPs ever trust venture capital after this? Why would anybody? Because based on the past four years, it doesn’t appear that venture capital is actually good at investing money — it just got lucky, year after year, until there were few ideas that could sell for hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Venture capital believed it knew better as it turned its back on basic business fundamentals, starting with Clubhouse, crypto, the metaverse, and now generative AI. Yet they’re far from the only fuckwits on the dickhead express. Per Bloomberg, there were at least $178.5 billion in data-center credit deals in the US in 2025, rivaling the $215.4 billion invested in US venture capital in 2024 and the $197.2 billion invested in US VC through August 7 2025, and over $100 billion more than the $60.69 billion of data center credit deals done in 2024. I’m very worried, and I’m going to tell you why, using a company called CoreWeave that I’ve been actively warning people about since March. CoreWeave is something called a “neocloud.” It’s a company that sells AI compute, and does so by renting out NVIDIA GPUs, and as I explained a few months ago, it does so by building data centers backed by endless debt: CoreWeave is one of the largest providers of AI compute in the world, and its business model is indicative of how most data center companies make money, and to explain my concerns, I’m going to explain why using this chart from CoreWeave’s Q2 2025 earnings presentation. First, CoreWeave signs contracts — such as its $14 billion deal with Meta and $22.4 billion deal with OpenAI — before it has the physical infrastructure to service them. It then raises debt using this contract as collateral, orders the GPUs from NVIDIA, which arrive after three months, and then take another three months to install, at which point monthly client payments begin. To really simplify this: data center developers are raising money months up to a year before they ever expect to make a penny. In fact, I can find no consistent answer to “how long a data center takes to build,” and the answer here is pretty important, because that’s how the money is gonna get made from these things. You may notice that “monthly payments” begin at 6 to 30 months, a curious and broad blob of time. You see, data centers are extremely difficult to build, and the concept of an “AI data center” is barely a few years old, with the concept of hundreds of megawatts in one data center campus entirely made up of AI GPUs barely two years old, which means basically everybody building one is doing so for the first time, and even experienced developers are running into problems. For example, Core Scientific, CoreWeave’s weird partner organization it tried and failed to buy, has been trying to convert its Denton Texas cryptocurrency mining data center into an AI data center since November 2024, specifically so that CoreWeave can rent it to Microsoft for OpenAI. This hasn’t gone well, with the Wall Street Journal reporting a few weeks ago that Denton has been wracked with “several months” of delays thanks to rainstorms preventing contractors from pouring concrete. The cluster is apparently going to have 260MW of capacity. What this means for CoreWeave is that it can’t start getting paid by OpenAI, because, per its contract, customers don’t have to start paying until the compute is actually available. This is a very important detail to know for literally any data center development you’ve ever seen. As of its latest Q3 2025 earnings filing, CoreWeave is sitting on $1.1 billion in deferred revenue (income for services not yet rendered), up from $951 million in Q2 2025 and $436 million in Q1 2025. This means deposits have been made, but the contract has yet to be serviced. Now, I’m a curious little critter, so I went and found the 921-page $2.6 billion DDTL 3.0 loan agreement between CoreWeave and banks including Morgan Stanley, MUFG Bank and Goldman Sachs, and in doing so learned the following: I apologize, that suggests that CoreWeave isn’t already in trouble. Buried inside NVIDIA’s latest earnings (page 17) there was a little clue: Credit where credit is due — eagle-eyed analyst JustDario caught this in November — but in CoreWeave’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, there sits a $477.5 million line-item under “restricted cash and cash equivalents, non-current.” Though this might not be the NVIDIA escrow — this number shifted from $617m in Q1 to $340m in Q2 — it lines up all-too-precisely…and who else would NVIDIA be guaranteeing? In any case, CoreWeave is likely getting the best deals in data center debt outside of Oracle. It has top-tier financiers (who I will get to shortly), the full backing of NVIDIA (which is both an investor, customer and apparent financial backstop), and the ability to raise debt quickly. CoreWeave’s deals are likely indicative of how data center financing takes place, and those top-tier financiers? It’s been in basically every deal. In fact… So, I went and dug through a pile of 26 prominent data center loan deals, including the proposed $38 billion debt package that Oracle and Vantage Data Center Partners are raising for Stargate Shackelford and Wisconsin, Stargate Abilene, New Mexico, SoftBank’s $15 billion bridge loan (which I included for a reason that will become obvious shortly) and multiple CoreWeave loans, and found a few commonalities: I realize there are far more data center deals than these, but I wanted to show you exactly how centralized these deals are. The largest deals — the $38 billion Stargate TX/WI deal and $18 billion Stargate New Mexico deal — both involved Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, SMBC and MUFG, and all four of those companies have, at some point, funded CoreWeave. In fact, everybody appears to have funded CoreWeave at some point — CitiBank, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Wells Fargo, Carlyle, Blackstone, BlackRock, Barclays, Magentar, and Jefferies to name a few. Of the 40 banks and financial institutions I researched, 24 have, at some point, loaned to or organized debt for CoreWeave. Of those institutions, Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, MUFG and Wells Fargo have done so multiple times. CoreWeave is a deeply unprofitable company saddled with incredible debt and deteriorating margins, with one of its largest clients paying net 360, and, as I’ve said, is arguably the best-financed data center company in the world. What I’m getting at is that most data center deals are likely much worse than the terms that CoreWeave faces, and are likely financed in a similar way, where a client is signed for data center capacity that doesn’t exist, such as when Nebius raised $4.3 billion through a share sale and convertible notes (read: loans) to handle its $17.4 billion data center contract with Microsoft, and guess what? Goldman Sachs acted as lead underwriter on the deal, with assistance from Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Morgan Stanley, all three of which have invested in CoreWeave. AI data centers are expensive, require debt due to the massive cost of construction and GPUs, and all take at least a year, if not two to start generating revenue, at which point they also begin losing money because it seems that renting out AI GPUs is really unprofitable. Every single major bank and financial institution has piled hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars into building data centers that take forever to even start generating money, at which point they only seem to lose it. Worse still, NVIDIA sells GPUs on a one-year upgrade cycle, meaning that all of those data centers being built right now are being filled with Blackwell chips, and by the time they turn on, NVIDIA will be selling its next-generation Vera Rubin chips. Now, you’ve probably heard that Vera Rubin will use the same racks (Oberon) as Blackwell, which is true to an extent, but won’t be true for long, as NVIDIA intends to shift to Kyber racks in 2027, hoping to build 1MW IT racks (which will involve entire racks-full of power supplies!), meaning that all of those data centers you see today — whenever they get built! — will be full of racks incompatible with the next generation of GPUs. This will also decrease the value of the assets inside the data centers, which will in turn decrease the value of the assets held by the firms investing. Stargate Abilene? The one invested in by JP Morgan, Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure and Societe Generale? The one that’s heavily delayed and won’t be ready until the end of 2026 at earliest? Full to the brim with two-year-old GB200 racks! By the beginning of 2027, Stargate Abilene will be obsolete, as will any and all data centers filled with Blackwell GPUs, as will any and all data centers being built today. Every single one takes 1-3 years and hundreds of millions (or billions) in debt, every single one faces the same kinds of construction delays, and better yet, almost all of them will turn on in roughly the same time frame. Now, I ain’t no economist, but I do know that “supply and demand” has an effect on pricing. What do you believe happens to the price of renting a Blackwell GPU when all of these data centers come on? Do you think it becomes more valuable? Or less? And while we’re on the subject, what do you think happens if there isn’t sufficient demand? Right now, OpenAI makes up a large chunk of the global sale of compute — at least $8.67 billion of Azure revenue through September 2025, $22.4 billion of CoreWeave’s backlog, $38 billion of Amazon’s backlog, and so on and so forth — and made, based on my reporting, just over $4.5 billion in that period. It cannot afford to pay anybody, and nowhere is that more obvious than when it negotiated year-long payment terms for CoreWeave. Otherwise, when you remove the contracts signed by hyperscalers and OpenAI (which I do not believe has paid anybody other than Microsoft yet), based on my analysis, there was less than a billion dollars of AI compute revenue in 2025, or 0.5831% of the money spent on data centers. Hyperscaler revenue is also immediately questionable, with Microsoft’s deal with Nebius (per its 6k filing) set to default in the event that Nebius cannot provide the capacity it sold out of its unfinished Vineland, New Jersey data center, which is being built by DataOne, a company which has never built an AI data center with a CEO that has his LinkedIn location set to “United Arab Emirates” with funding from a concrete firm that is also a vendor on the construction project. I also believe Microsoft is setting Nebius up to fail. Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of plans for the Vineland, New Jersey data center, Nebius has agreed to timelines that involve having 18,000 NVIDIA B200 and B300 GPUs by the end of January for a total of 50MW, with another 18,000 B300s due by the end of May. On speaking with experts in the field about how viable these plans are, two laughed, and one told me to fuck off. If Nebius fails to build the capacity, Microsoft can walk away, much like OpenAI can walk away from Stargate in the event that Oracle fails to build it on time (as reported by The Information in April), and I believe that this is the case for literally any data center provider that’s building a data center for any signed-up tenant. This is another layer of risk to data center development that nobody bothers to discuss, because everybody loves seeing these big, beautiful numbers. Except the numbers might have become a little too beautiful for some. A few weeks ago, the Financial Times reported that Blue Owl Capital had pulled out of the $10 billion Michigan Stargate Data Center project, citing “concerns about its rising debt and artificial intelligence spending.” To quote the FT, “Blue Owl had been in discussions with lenders and Oracle about investing in the planned 1 gigawatt data centre being built to serve OpenAI in Saline Township, Michigan.” What debt, you ask? Well, Blue Owl — formerly the loosest legs in data center financing — was in CoreWeave’s $600 million and $750 million debt deals for its planned Virginia data center with Chirisa Technology Parks, as well as a $4 billion CoreWeave data center project in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Stargate Abilene and Stargate Mexico, Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center, and a $1.3 billion data center deal in Australia through Stack Infrastructure, a company it owns through its acquisition of IPI Partners. To be clear, Blue Owl “pulling out” is not the same as a regular deal. It’s a BDC — Business Development Corporation — that invests both its own money and rallies together various banks, in this case SMBC, BNP Paribas, MUFG and Goldman Sachs (all part of Stargate New Mexico). Blue Owl is incredibly well-connected and experienced in putting together these kinds of deals, and very likely went to the many banks it’s worked with over the years, who apparently had “concerns about its rising debt,” much of it issued by them! While rumours suggest that Blackstone may “step in,” the banks that will actually back a $10 billion deal are fairly narrow, and “stepping in” would require billions of dollars and legal logistics. So, why are things looking shaky? Well, remember that thing about how this data center would be leased to Oracle? Well, it had a free cash flow of negative thirteen billion on revenues of $16 billion, with its most-recent earnings only "beat" on estimates only thanks to the sale of its $2.68 billion stake in Ampere. Its debt is exploding (with over a billion dollars in interest payments in its last quarter), its GPU gross margins are 14% (which does not mean profitable), its latest NVIDIA GB200 GPUs have a negative 100% gross margin, and it has $248 billion in upcoming data center leases yet to begin. All, for the most part, to handle compute for one customer: OpenAI, which needs to raise $100 billion, I guess. We’ve already got some signs of concern within the banking world around data center exposure. In November, the FT reported that Deutsche Bank — which backed CoreWeave multiple times and several data centers — was “exploring ways to hedge its exposure to data centers after extending billions of dollars in debt,” including shorting a “basket of AI-related stocks” or buying default protection on some of its debt using synthetic risk transfers, which are when a bank sells the full or partial credit risk of a loan (or loans) to another bank while keeping the loans on their book, paying a monthly fee to investors (this is a simplification). In December, Fortune reported that Morgan Stanley (CoreWeave three times, IPI Partners, Hyperion, SoftBank Bridge Loan) was also considering synthetic risk transfers on “loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure.” Back in April, SMBC sold synthetic risk transfers tied to “private debt BDCs” — and while this predates the large data center deals done by Blue Owl, SMBC has overseen multiple Blue Owl deals in the past. In December, SMBC closed another SRT, selling off risk from “Australian and Asian project finance loans,” though I can’t confirm if any of them were data center related. In December, Goldman Sachs paused a planned mortgage-bond sale for data center operator CyrusOne, with the intent to revive it in the first quarter of 2026. Oracle’s credit risk reached a 16-year high in the middle of December, with credit default swaps (basically, betting that Oracle will default on its debts, an unlikely yet no-longer-impossible event) climbing to their highest price since the great financial crisis. While Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank’s SRTs are yet to close, it’s still notable that two of the largest players in data center financing feel the need to hedge their bets. So, what exactly are they hedging against? Simple! That tenants won’t arrive and debts won’t get paid. I also believe they’re going to need bigger hedges, because I don’t think there is enough actual demand for AI to meet the data centers being built, and I think most data center loans end up being underwater within the next two years. I realize we’ve taken a great deal of words to get here, but every single part was necessary to explain what I think happens next. Let’s start by quoting my premium newsletter from a few weeks ago: You see, every little link in the chain of pain is necessary to understand things. In really simple terms, I believe that almost every investment in a data center or AI startup may go to zero. Let me explain. If we assume that 50% of $171.5 (so $85.75) billion in data center debt is in GPUs, that’s around 3.2GW of data center capacity, based on my model of NVIDIA’s approximate split of sales between different AI GPUs from my premium piece last week. The likelihood of the majority of these projects being A) completed within the next year and B) completed on budget is very, very small. Every delay increases the likelihood of default, as each of these projects is heavily debt-based. The customers of these projects are either hyperscalers (who are only “doing AI” because they have no other hypergrowth ideas and because Wall Street currently approves) or AI startups, all of whom are unprofitable. While there are potentially hedge funds or other companies looking for “private AI” integrations, I think this is a very, very small market. On top of that, AI compute itself may not be profitable, and because, by my estimate, everybody has spent about $85 billion on filling data centers with the same GPUs, the aggregate price of renting out GPUs will decline. Already the average price of Blackwell GPUs has declined to an average of $4.41 an hour according to Silicon Data, and that’s before the majority of Blackwell-powered GPUs come online. Yet the customer base shrinks from there, because the majority of AI startups aren’t actually renting GPUs — they build products on top of models built by OpenAI or Anthropic, who have made it clear they’re buying capacity from either hyperscalers or, in OpenAI’s case, getting Oracle or CoreWeave to build it for them. Why? Because building your own model is incredibly capital-intensive, and it’s hard to tell if the results will be worth it. Now, let’s assume — I don’t actually believe it will, but let’s try anyway — that all of that 3.2GW of capacity comes online. How much compute does an AI company use? OpenAI claims it has 2GW of capacity as of the end of 2025, and is allegedly approaching 900 million weekly active users. I don’t think there are any AI companies with even 10% of that userbase, but even if there were, OpenAI spent $8.67 billion on inference through the end of September. Who can afford to pay even 10% of that a year? Or 5%? Yet in reality, OpenAI is likely more indicative of the overall compute spend of the entire AI industry. As I’ve said, most companies are powered not by their own GPU-driven models, but by renting them from other providers. OpenAI and Anthropic spent a combined $11.33 billion in compute on Azure and AWS respectively through the first 9 months of this year, and as the two largest consumers of AI compute, which suggests two things: In fact, it would take sinking every single dollar of venture capital — over $200 billion — every single year and then some funneled into AI compute just to provide the revenue to justify these deals. In the space of a year, Microsoft Azure made $75 billion, Google Cloud $43 billion and Amazon Web Services $100 billion. Need more proof? Still don’t believe me? Then skip to page 18 of NVIDIA’s most-recent earnings: If there’s such incredible, surging demand, why exactly is NVIDIA spending six fucking billion dollars a year in 2026 and 2027 on cloud compute? NVIDIA doesn’t need the compute — it just shut down its AWS rival DGX Cloud! It looks far more like NVIDIA is propping up an industry with non-existent demand. I’m afraid there is no secret AWS-sized spend waiting in the wings for the right moment to pounce. There is no secret demand wave, nor is there any capacity crunch that is holding back incredible swaths of revenue. Oracle’s $523 billion in remaining performance obligations are made up of OpenAI, Meta, and fucking NVIDIA. For AI data centers to make sense, most startups would have to start becoming direct users of AI compute, while also spending more on cloud compute services than they’ve ever spent. The largest consumers of AI compute are both unprofitable, unsustainable monstrosities. Eventually, reality will dawn on one or more of these banks. Projects will get delayed thanks to weather, or budgetary issues, or when customers walk away (as just happened to data center REIT Fermi). Loan payments will start going unpaid. Elsewhere, AI startups will keep asking for money, again and again, and for a while they’ll keep raising, until the valuations get too high, or VC coffers get too low. You’re probably gonna say at this point that Anthropic or OpenAI might go public, which will infuse capital into the system, and I want to give you a preview of what to look forward to, courtesy of AI labs MiniMax and Zhipu (as reported by The Information), which just filed to go public in Hong Kong. Anyway, I’m sure these numbers are great-oh my GOD! In the first half of this year, Zhipu had a net loss of $334 million on $27 million in revenue, and guess what, 85% of that revenue came from enterprise customers. Meanwhile, MiniMax made $53.4 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, and burned $211 million to earn it. It is time to wake up. These are the real-life costs of running an AI company. OpenAI and Anthropic are going to be even worse. This is why nobody wants to take AI companies public. This is why nobody wants to talk about the actual costs of AI. This is why nobody wants you to know the hourly cost of running a GPU, and this is why OpenAI and Anthropic both burn billions of dollars — the margins fucking stink, every product is unprofitable, and none of these companies can afford their bills based on their actual cashflow. Generative AI is not a functional industry, and once the money works that out, everything burns. Though many AI data centers boast of having tenancy agreements, remember that these agreements are either with AI startups that will run out of money or hyperscalers with legal teams numbering in the thousands. Every single deal that Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google or NVIDIA signs is riddled with outs specifically hedging against this scenario, and there won’t be a damn thing that anybody can do if hyperscalers decide to walk away. Before then, NVIDIA’s bubble is likely to burst. As I discussed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA claims to have shipped six million Blackwell GPUs, and while it may be employing very dodgy maths (claiming each Blackwell GPU is actually two GPUs because each one has two chips), my modeling of its last three quarters suggests that NVIDIA shipped around 5.33GW’s worth of GPUs — and based on reading about every single data center I can find, it doesn’t appear that many have been built and powered on. Worse still, NVIDIA’s diversified revenue is collapsing. In Q1FY26, two customers represented 16% and 14% of revenue, in Q2FY26 two customers represented 23% and 16% of revenue, and in Q3FY26 four customers represented 22%, 15%, 13% and 11% of total revenue, with all that money going toward either GPUs or networking gear. I go into detail here, but I put it in a chart to show you why this is bad: In simpler terms, NVIDIA’s revenue is no longer coming from a diverse swath of customers. In Q1FY26, NVIDIA had $30.84 billion of diversified revenue, Q2 $28.51 billion, and Q3 $22.23 billion. NVIDIA GPUs are astronomically expensive — $4.5 million for a GB300 rack of 72 B300 GPUs, for example — and filling data centers full of them requires debt unless you’re a hyperscaler. While I can’t say for sure, I believe NVIDIA’s diversified revenue collapse is a sign that smaller data center projects are starting to have issues getting funded, and/or hyperscalers are pulling back on their GPU purchases. To look through the eyes of an AI booster — all I’m seeing is blue and yellow, as usual! — one might say that these big customers are covering the loss of revenue, but the reality is that these big projects are run on debt issued by banks that are becoming increasingly-worried about nobody paying them back. The mistake that every investor, commentator, analyst and member of the media makes about NVIDIA is believing that its sales are an expression of demand for AI compute, when it’s really more of a statement about the availability of debt from banks and private credit. Similarly, the continued existence of AI startups is an expression of the desperation of venture capital, and the continuing flow of massive funding rounds is a sign that they see no other avenues for growth. Eventually, data centers are going to go unbuilt, and data center debt packages will begin to fall apart. Remember, Oracle’s $38 billion data center deal is actually yet to close, much like Stargate New Mexico is yet to close. These deals, while seeming like they’re trending positively, are both incredibly important to the future of the AI bubble, and any failure will spook an already-nervous market. Only one link in the chain needs to break. Every part of the AI bubble — this fucking charade — is unprofitable, save for NVIDIA and the construction firms erecting future laser tag arenas full of negative-margin GPUs. What happens if the debt stops flowing to data centers? How will NVIDIA sell those 20 million Blackwell and Vera Rubin GPUs? What happens if venture capitalists start running low on funds, and can’t keep feeding hundreds of millions of dollars to AI startups so that they can feed them to Anthropic or OpenAI? What happens to OpenAI and Anthropic if their already negative-margin businesses when their customers run out of money? What happens to Oracle or CoreWeave’s work-in-progress data centers if OpenAI can’t pay its bills? What happens to Anthropic’s $21 billion of Broadcom orders, or tens of billions of Google Cloud spend? In the last year, I estimate I’ve been asked the question “what if you’re wrong?” over 25 times. Every single time the question comes with an undercurrent of venom — the suggestion that I’m being an asshole for daring to question the wondrous AI bubble. Every single person who has asked this has been poorly-read — both in terms of my work and the surrounding economics and technological possibilities of Large Language Models — and believes they’re defending technology, when in reality they’re defending growth, and the Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mindset. In many cases they are not excited about technology, but the prospects of being first in line to lick an already-sparkling boot. This has never been about progress or productivity. If it was, we’d actually see progress, or productivity boosts, or anything other than the frothiest debt and venture markets of all time. Large Language Models do not create novel concepts, they are inconsistent and unreliable, and even the “good” things they do vary wildly thanks to the dramatic variance of a giant probability machine. LLMs are not good enough for people to pay regular software prices at any scale, and the consequences of this will be that every single dollar spent on GPUs has been for exactly one point: manipulating the value of their stocks. AI does not have the business returns and may have negative gross margins. It is inconsistent, ugly, unreliable, expensive and environmentally ruinous, pissing off a large chunk of consumers and underwhelming most of the rest, other than those convinced they’re smart for using it or those who have resigned to giving up at the sight of a confidence game sold by a tech industry that stopped making products primarily focused on solving the problems of consumers or businesses some time ago. You may say that I’m wrong because Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon continue to have healthy net revenues and revenue growth, and as I previously said, these companies are not sharing AI revenues and their existing businesses are still growing due to the massive monopolies they’ve built. And I want to plea to AI boosters and bullish analysts alike: you are being had. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Safra Catz, Elon Musk, Clay Magouyrk, Mark Sicilia, Michael Truell, Aravind Srivinas — all of them are laughing at you behind your back, because they know that you are never going to ask the obvious questions that would defeat my arguments, and know that you will never, ever push back on them. The enshittification of the shareholder has the downstream effect of an enshittification of the media and Wall Street analysts writ large. These companies own you. They treat you with disdain and condescension, because they know you’ll let them. They know that no sell-side analyst will ever ask them “when will you be profitable?” or “how much are you spending?” or if you do ask, they know you will experience temporary amnesia and forget whatever answer they give, because these are the incentives of an enshittified stock market, where stocks are not extrapolations of shareholder value but chips in a fucking casino where the house always wins and changes the rules every three months. They have changed the meaning of “stock” to mean “what the market will reward,” and when you allow companies to start dictating the terms of what will be rewarded — as neoliberalism, Friedman, Reagan, Nixon, NAFTA, Thatcher, and every other policy has, orienting everything exclusively around growth — companies eventually cut off any powers that may curtail any reevaluation of the fundamental terms of capitalism, and the incentives within. Focusing on growth-at-all-costs thinking naturally encourages, enables, and empowers grifters, because all they ever have to promise is “more” — more users, more debt, more venture, more features, more everything. The very institutions that are meant to hold companies accountable — analysts and the media — are far more desperate to trade scoops for interviews, to pull punches, to find ways to explain why a company is right rather than understand what the company is doing, and this is something pushed not by writers, but by editors that want to make sure they stay on the right side of the largest companies. And if I’m right, OpenAI’s death will kill off most if not all other AI startups, Anthropic included. Every investor that invested in AI will take massive losses. Every startup that builds on the back of their models will see their company fold, if it hasn’t already due to the massive costs and upcoming price increases. The majority of GPU-based data centers — which really have no other revenue stream — will be left inert, likely powered down, waiting for the day that somebody works it all out, which they won’t, because literally everybody has these things now and I truly believe they’ve tried everything. I don’t “hate on AI” because I am a hater, I hate on it because it fucking sucks and what I’m worried about happening seems to be happening. The tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, and in its desperation hitched itself to the least-profitable hardware and software in history, then spent three straight years lying about what was possible to the media, analysts and shareholders. And they were allowed to lie, because everybody lapped it the fuck up. They didn’t need to worry about convincing anybody. Financiers, editors, analysts and investors were already drafting reasons why they were excited about something they didn’t really understand or believe in, other than the fact it promised more. This is what happens when you make everything about growth: everybody becomes stupid, ready to be conned, ready to hear what the next big growth thing is because asking nasty questions gets you fucking fired. And what’s left is a tech industry that doesn’t build technology, but growth-focused startups. Look at Silicon Valley. Do you see these fucking people ever building a new kind of computer? Do you believe these men fit to even imagine a future? These men care about the status quo, they want to always have more software to sell or ways to increase advertising revenue so that the stock number goes up so they receive more money in the form of stock compensation. They are concerned with neither actual business value, honest exchange of value, or societal value. Their existence is only in shareholder value, which is how they are incentivized by their board of directors. And really, if you’re still defending AI -- does it matter to any of you that this software fucking sucks, does it? If you think it’s good you don’t know much about software! It does not respond precisely at any point to a user or programmer’s intent. That’s bad software. I don’t care that you have heard developers really like it, because that doesn’t fix the underlying economic and social poison in AI. I don’t care that it sort of replaced search for you. I don’t care if you “know a team of engineers that use it.” Every single AI app is subsidized, its price is fake, you are being lied to, and none of this is real. When the collapse happens, do not let a single person that waved off the economics have a moment’s peace. Do not let anybody who sat in front of Dario Amodei or Sam Altman and squealed with delight at whatever vacuous talking points they burped out forget that they didn’t push them, they didn’t ask hard questions, they didn’t worry or wonder or feel any concern for investors or the general public. Do not let a single analyst that called AI skeptics “luddites” or equated them to flat Earthers hear the end of it. Do not let anybody who claimed that we “lost control of AI” or “blackmailed developers” go without their complementary “Fell For It Again” badge. When it happens, I promise I won’t be too insufferable, but I will be calling for accountability for anybody who boosted AI 2027, who sat in front of Sam Altman or Dario Amodei and refused to ask real questions, and for anyone who collected anything resembling “detailed notes” about me or any other AI skeptic. If you think I’m talking about you, I probably am, and I have a question: why didn’t you approach the AI companies with as much skepticism as you did the skeptics? I also promise you, if I’m wrong, I’ll happily explain how and why, and I’ll do so at length, too. I will have links and citations, I’ll do podcast episodes. I will make a good faith effort to explain every single failing, because my concern is the truth, and I would love everybody else to follow suit. Do you think any booster will have the same courtesy? Do you think they care about the truth? Or do they just want to get a fish biscuit from Sam Altman or Jensen Huang? Pathetic. It’s times like this where it’s necessary to make the point that there is absolutely “enough money” to end hunger or build enough affordable housing or have universal healthcare, but they would be “too expensive” or “not profitable enough,” despite having a blatant and obvious economic benefit in that more people would have happier, better lives and — if you must see the world in purely reptilian senses — enable many more people to have disposable income and the means of entering the economy on even terms. By contrast, investments in AI do not appear to be driving much economic growth at all, other than in the revenue driven to NVIDIA from selling these GPUs, and the construction of data centers themselves. Had Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon sunk $776 billion into building housing and renting it out, the world would be uneven, we would have horrible new landlords, and it would still be a great deal better than one where nearly a trillion dollars is being wasted propping up a broken, doomed industry, all because the people in charge are fucking idiots obsessed with growth. The future, I believe, spells chaos, and I am trying to rise to the occasion. My work has transformed from being critical of the tech industry to a larger critique of the global financial system. I’ve had to learn accountancy, the mechanics of venture and private equity, and all sorts of annoying debt-related language, all so that I sufficiently explain what’s going on. I see several worrying signs I have yet to fully understand. The Discount Window — where banks go when they need quick liquidity as a last resort — has seen a steady increase of loans on its books since September 2024, suggesting that financial institutions are facing liquidity issues, and the last few times that this has happened, financial crises followed. There is also a brewing bullshit crisis in Private Equity, which is heavily invested in data centers. In September, Auto parts maker First Brands collapsed in a puff of fraud with billions of dollars “vanishing” after it double-pledged the same collateral to multiple loans, off-balance sheet liabilities, falsified invoices, and even leased some of the parts it sold. This wasn’t a case where smaller lenders were swindled, either — global investment banks UBS and Jefferies both lost hundreds of millions of dollars, along with asset manager BlackRock through associated funds. Subprime auto lender Tricolor collapsed in similar circumstances, burning JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Zions Bancorporation, who also loaned money to First Brands. A similar situation is currently brewing with Solar company PosiGen, which recently filed for bankruptcy after, you guessed it, double-pledging collateral for loans. One of its equity financing backers is Magnetar Capital, who invested in CoreWeave. What appears to be happening is simple: large financial institutions are issuing debt without doing the necessary due diligence or considering the future financial health of the companies involved. Private Equity firms are also heavily-leveraged, sidling acquisitions with debt, and playing silly games where they “volatility launder” — deliberately choosing not to regularly revalue assets held to make returns (or the value of assets) look better to their investors. I don’t really know what this means right now, but I am worried that these data center loans have been entered into under similarly-questionable circumstances. Every single data center deal is based on the phony logic that AI will somehow become profitable one day, and if there’s even one First Brands situation, the entire thing collapses. I realize this is the longest thing I’ve ever written (or should I say written so far?), and I want to end it on a positive note, because hundreds of thousands of people now read and listen to my work, and it’s important to note how much support I’ve received and how awesome it is seeing people pick up my work and run with. I want to be clear that there is very little that separates you from the people running these companies, or many analysts. I have taught myself everything I know from scratch, and I believe you can too, and I hope I have been able to and will be able to teach you everything I know, which is why everything I write is so long. Well, that and I’m working out what I’m going to say as I write it. The AI bubble is an inflation of capital and egos, of people emboldened and outright horny over the prospect of millions of people’s livelihoods being automated away. It is a global event where we’ve realized how the global elite are just as stupid and ignorant as anybody you’d meet on the street — Business Idiots that couldn’t think their way out of a paper bag, empowered by other Business Idiots that desperately need to believe that everything will grow forever. I have had a tremendous amount of help in the last year — from my editor Matt Hughes, Robert and Sophie at Cool Zone Media, Better Offline producer Matt Osowski, Kakashii and JustDario (two pseudonymous analysts that know more about LLMs and finance than most people I read), Kasey Kagawa, Ed Ongweso Jr., Rob Smith, Bryce Elder and Tabby Kinder of the Financial Times, all of whom have been generous with their time, energy and support. A special shoutout to Caleb Wilson (Kill The Computer) and Arif Hasan (Wide Left), my cohosts on our NFL podcast 60 Minute Drill. And I’ve heard from thousands of you about how frustrated you are, and how none of this makes sense, and how crazy you feel seeing AI get shoved into every product, how insane it marks you feel when somebody tells you that LLMs are amazing when their actual outputs fucking suck. We are all being lied to, we all feel gaslit and manipulated and punished for not pledging ourselves to Sam Altman’s graveyard smash, but I believe we are right. In the last year, my work has gone from being relatively popular to being cited by multiple major international news organizations, hedge funds, and internal investor analyses. I was profiled by the Financial Times, went on the BBC twice, and watched as my Subreddit, r/BetterOffline, grew to around 80,000 visitors a week and became one of the 20th largest podcast Subreddits, which is a bigger deal than it sounds. I believe there are millions of people that are tired of the state of the tech industry, and disgusted at what these people have done to the computer. I believe that they outnumber the boosters, the analysts and the hype-fiends that have propped up this era. I believe that a better world is possible by creating a meaningful consensus around making the powerful prove themselves to us rather than proving it for them.

Title: New BioShock 4 leak details Casino location, ‘Flushers’ enemies amid troubled development rumors

BioShock, released in 2007, was developed and published by 2K Boston and 2K Australia; the former would later become Irrational Games. The game was set in the city of Rapture, an underwater city built in the 1940s by a wealthy businessman who sought to create a utopia for the elite, free from the control and limitations of governments. To protect Rapture from outside influence, all contact with the outside world is banned. As the city prospered, the wealth disparity grew larger and larger, leaving the top few with more than they needed and the rest to survive on mere crumbs. It was in this poverty-stricken environment that certain events would lead to an all-out war between the city’s wealthy and the downtrodden. The game received universal acclaim, being praised for its narrative themes, visual designs, and gameplay. It is also considered to be one of the best games ever made. It was followed by two sequels, BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite. Back in December 2019, BioShock 4 was finally announced by 2K Games, along with a new developer, Cloud Chamber, though there was no official release date. Speculation has suggested a 2027-2028 release date. The last time the public had heard of the project was not good news. Leaks told a tale of development hell over the studio, granted, the daunting task of making a sequel to what has been labeled one of the greatest games of all time. A Bloomberg article, following the leaks, suggested that the company was experiencing another shakeup after failing an internal review at 2K Games. According to Bloomberg, 2K said, "working hard to set Bioshock up for the best possible future." It continued, "Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path." Recently, an online publication, MP1st, has claimed that leaks shared directly with the publication reveal a Casino that will serve as a prominent setting in the series. It also speaks about two potential vital characters. Flushers, or as the leak calls them, are the standard enemy players might face in the new world of BioShock 4. While the leaks may intrigue players and keep them craving more, it's worth noting that the game was once again delayed due to the 2025 layoffs at Cloud Chamber. BioShock 4 has yet to receive an official release date, but it might be closer to 2027 or 2028 than 2026, even given the leaks reported so far. With Netflix also working on a movie adaptation of the original title, plenty is happening in the BioShock universe, even if gamers will fully experience most of it after a significant time gap.
