Thousands of attendees packed into a hockey arena in San Jose, Calif. yesterday (March 18) to hear from Jensen Huang kick off Nvidia (NVDA)’s annual developer conference, GTC. Dubbed the “Super Bowl of A.I.” by the CEO, the event’s audience also included the grandchildren of Vera Rubin, a famed astronomer for whom Nvidia’s upcoming GPU architecture is named.

You can opt out anytime. Naming chips after prominent scientists has been a decades-long tradition at Nvidia. Following its upcoming Rubin GPUs, set for release in late 2026, the company plans to introduce a successor architecture named after theoretical physicist Richard Feynman, Huang revealed yesterday. The in-production Blackwell chip, unveiled at last year’s GTC, is named for mathematician David Blackwell. Since 1998, Nvidia has drawn naming inspiration from computer scientists, mathematicians, astronomers and physicists since 1998. These scientific figures are such a core part of Nvidia’s culture that their faces appear on employee-only company merchandise labeled with the names of Nvidia’s “heroes.” Early architectures took cues from icons like Nikola Tesla and Johannes Kepler, while more recent product lines have spotlighted women in science, including GPUs named after Vera Rubin, Grace Hopper and Ada Lovelace. Here’s a closer look at some of the scientists who have been honored by the chipmaking giant over the past few years: Contributions to quantum electrodynamics were among the many accomplishments of Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist who died in 1988 at age 69. He received the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for his efforts in the field. Feynman additionally worked on the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, during World War II. Most of the American public, however, first became aware of the scientist when he served on a presidential commission investigating the 1986 explosion of the Challenger space shuttle. Vera Rubin is most well-known for having provided evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe. Working alongside astronomer Kent Ford in the 1960s, the duo came across the discovery after studying more than 60 galaxies. A pioneering female astronomer, Rubin was the first woman to serve as scientist staffer at the Carnegie Institution’s Department of Terrestrial Magnetism and in 1993 was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. She died in 2016 at age 88. Nvidia’s sought-after Blackwell chips were inspired by David Blackwell, a mathematician and statistician who died in 2010 at age 91. In addition to groundbreaking contributions to game theory, probability theory and information theory, Blackwell penned one of the first-ever textbooks on Bayesian statistics in 1969. He also set milestones in the science community, becoming the first Black scholar to be admitted to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965. He was also the first Black professor to receive tenure at the University of California, Berkeley, and joined the school’s faculty in the 1950s. Nvidia’s Hopper chips, announced in 2022 and more commonly referred to as its H100 GPUs, took its name from computer scientist and naval officer Grace Hopper. She notably worked on Mark I, America’s first electromechanical computer, and the subsequent Mark II and Mark III computers during her time in the Navy. Appointed a Rear Admiral in the 1980s, she was the oldest officer on active duty when she retired in 1986. After leaving the Navy, Hopper worked for the Digital Equipment Corporation until her death in 1992 at age 85. She received the National Medal of Technology from President George Bush the year prior for her contributions to computer programming languages. When it came to naming its Ada architecture three years ago, Nvidia went back to the 19th-century to draw inspiration from the 1800s mathematician Ada Lovelace. The daughter of British poet Lord Byron, Lovelace—who died in 1843 at age 36—is often recognized as the world’s first computer programmer. Some of her most notable work occurred in 1843, when Lovelace added a set of notes to a translated academic article that laid out what many consider to be the first computer program. Her contributions were rediscovered in the late 1970s, leading the U.S. Department of Defense to name the Ada programming language after her.

Title: Notebooks as reusable Python programs

We've launched our YouTube channel! Subscribe for tutorials and demos. Akshay @akshaykagrawal Myles @themylesfiles Dylan Madisetti @dmadisetti marimo is free and open source, available on GitHub. This blog post is also accompanied by a YouTube video. In a previous post, on lessons learned redesigning the Python notebook, we wrote: A lot of important work happens in notebooks — research, large scale experimentation, data engineering, and more. But this kind of work should be treated as Python software, and it shouldn’t be done in error-prone JSON scratchpads. In that post we described design decisions that allowed us to create a new kind of notebook (marimo), one that blended the best parts of interactive computing with the maintainability, reusability, and interoperability of software. Part of our solution was to represent notebooks as Python programs — not just as flat scripts, but as reusable modules. In this post, we dive deep into our representation of notebooks as Python files — showing how our file format makes notebooks versionable with Git, importable as modules, testable with pytest, executable as scripts, and much, more, while still being compatible with other languages like SQL and Markdown. We also discussing how we design around tradeoffs, such as keeping a record of visual outputs. Contents The status quo is not working Python, not JSON: a new plaintext file format Anatomy of a notebook file Examples Version with Git Test with pytest Test with doctests Reuse functions and classes in other Python files Reuse cells and notebooks in other notebooks Run as Python scripts Script metadata for packaging and configuration Embed SQL and Markdown Edit as plaintext files Output storage It just works AI developers, data engineers, data scientists, and researchers do a lot of their work in Python notebooks like Jupyter. We know this from first-hand experience; we’ve worked as engineers at Google Brain and Palantir, and lived in notebooks, for better or worse, during PhDs at Stanford and Johns Hopkins. Traditional notebooks’ usefulness is severely limited by the JSON-based ipynb file format (among other things). This file format combines code and outputs in what Pydantic creator Samuel Colvin calls a “horrid blob”, and is directly responsible for the following sad state of affairs: While it’s true that you can get cleaner diffs by using Jupytext (if you’re sufficiently motivated) or Databricks source notebooks (if you’re a paying customer), naively storing notebooks as flat Python scripts like these tools do won’t solve the other problems enumerated above. In particular, importing a Jupytext-processed or Databricks source-format notebook as a module will also run all its cells — a potentially very expensive side-effect if all you wanted was to import a function or class. nbdev is a framework that lets developers “write, test, document, and distribute software packages and technical articles” using Jupyter notebooks, a goal that we consider orthogonal to our goal of making a new kind of Python notebook that is a simple software artifact, just like any other Python file. We are not interested in replacing traditional software development with notebooks. When working with Jupyter, too often you end up with directories strewn with spaghetti-code notebooks, counting up to Untitled12.ipynb or higher. You the notebook author don’t know what’s in these notebooks, you don’t understand their Git history, you don’t know what packages were used in each notebook, you haven’t tested anything because how do you even test notebooks, and you’re unsure if you — let alone your colleagues — will be able to run them in the future. Despite these problems (and others — by one study, less than four percent of Jupyter notebooks on GitHub are reproducible), people continue using traditional notebooks for production tasks like pipelines (e.g., Databricks workflows), as well as areas where reproducibility is paramount, like AI development and science. Why? Because, until recently, Jupyter notebooks were the only programming environment that let you see your data while you worked on it. Interactivity is so crucial to data work that hundreds of thousands of data professionals decided the trade-offs were worth it. Instead of accepting this sad state of affairs, or trying to work around it with clunky extensions or complicated frameworks, we decided it was worth it to reinvent notebooks as regular Python programs — we wanted to make something that just worked. It was from this belief that the marimo notebook was born. marimo stores notebooks as plaintext Python files (e.g. notebook.py) with the following properties: After a lot of careful consideration, we landed on files that look like this: This file format encodes how data flows across the notebook: as we explained in our previous post, marimo represents notebooks as dataflow graphs to improve reproducibility (eliminating hidden state) and enable seamless interactivity with UI elements. marimo automatically generates notebook files on save from the marimo editor, but developers can also create or edit these files in their text editor of choice (ours are neovim and Cursor). Header. The notebook file starts with a header that imports marimo, notes the version of marimo that created the file, and instantiates an App object to which cells are added. Cells. Cells are stored in notebook presentation order. Each cell is serialized as a function that accepts its variable references and return its definitions; cells are added to the notebook via the app.cell decorator. Users can optionally name their cells, which become the names of the decorated functions. This serialization strategy departs from Jupytext-style (or Databricks-style) flat scripts, which demarcate cells with comments instead of wrapping them in functions. Importing Jupytext or Databricks notebook files runs all their cells, which is expensive and almost never what you want. In contrast, in our file format, cells are not executed on import because they are wrapped in functions. Functions and classes. This part of our notebook specification is slated for release in version 0.12.0. Cells that define top-level functions or classes are serialized directly in the file, so they can be reused by other Python modules (from my_notebook import my_function). An optional top-level setup cell, not shown here, can make symbols available to these functions, such as imported modules and constants. Footer. An if __name__ == "__main__" guard protects a call to app.run(), which executes the notebook’s cells in a topologically sorted order. Our simple file format makes it possible to treat notebooks like any other Python program. Here are some examples of what our file format enables: Version with Git Test with pytest Test with doctests Reuse functions and classes in other Python files Reuse cells and notebooks in other notebooks Run as Python scripts Script metadata for packaging and configuration Embed SQL and Markdown Edit as plaintext files Small changes to notebook code are guaranteed to make small localized changes to the notebook file, yielding easy-to-read Git diffs. For example, consider a one character change, modifying to marimo notebook diff. Here’s the Git diff for a marimo notebook file: It corresponds exactly to the code change, with the notebook file changed in just one place. Jupyter notebook diff. In contrast, because ipynb files stores base64-encoded blobs of outputs, the diff for the equivalent Jupyter notebook contains 42,571 characters. Moreover, the notebook contains many changes unrelated to the actual single character code change. Here is an abbreviated version of the diff, with truncated blobs. Not only are these diffs impossible to read for an individual, they also make resolving merge conflicts very difficult. Because marimo notebooks are just Python files, they are interoperable with other tools for Python — including pytest. In contrast, there is no standard way to test code in Jupyter notebooks, which is part of the reason why so many traditional notebooks fall over from incorrectness. Testing cells. Any cell named as test_* is automatically discoverable and testable by pytest. The same goes for any cell that contains only test_ functions and Test classes. Importantly, because cells are wrapped in functions, running pytest test_notebook.py doesn’t execute the entire notebook — just its tests. Example. Consider running pytest on the following code: This prints: marimo also supports doctest out of the box: just call doctest.testmod() in your notebook, in a cell that references the functions you’d like to test. This can be especially helpful when defining and documenting functions in marimo notebooks that will be used elsewhere. Coming soon, in version 0.12.0. Our file format also makes it easy and natural to reuse functions and classes defined in your notebook; just import them like you would from a regular notebook file: This works for cells that have just a single function definition or class definition. Additionally, the functions and classes must have no other references other than imported modules or other symbols that you the notebook author define in a special setup cell (functions and classes can also refer to other top-level functions). For example, the below notebook contains a setup cell that imports numpy, and a cell that defines a function that uses numpy. Unlike other cells, the setup cell’s body is at the top-level of the file (it’s not wrapped in a function), so its variables are made available to the notebook’s functions. You can define the setup cell by simply editing the notebook file in a text editor, or through the marimo editor. Cells. Named cells can be used in other notebooks: Here, defs is a dictionary containing the variables the cell defines, and output the value of the cell’s last expression (i.e., its visual output). By default, running a cell in this way will also run its ancestors. The run method can be parametrized to override the values of its references and prevent ancestor execution. (This API was inspired by Observable notebooks.) See our docs for an example. Notebooks. Entire notebooks can be embedded in other notebooks: This lets you reuse the user interface of a marimo notebook as a component (since marimo makes it easy for notebooks to be rendered as interactive web apps). Our docs include a usage example. Every marimo notebook can be run as a script; This runs the notebook cells in a topologically sorted order. You can also pass command-line arguments to your notebook, which can be read with the library function marimo.cli_args(): Since marimo notebooks are just Python, you can also use argparse to declare and parse arguments. And, since marimo does not support magic commands (we don’t need them), your notebook is guaranteed to work as as script. Thanks to PEP 723, there is now an agreed-upon Python specification for storing metadata in single-file Python scripts. This metadata is similar to a pyproject.toml and stored as a header comment, such as: Because marimo notebooks are just Python files, we can use this spec to communicate metadata to other tools in the Python ecosystem. Package requirements. For reproducibility, marimo users can document their notebook’s dependencies in script metadata. When given a notebook with inline dependencies, marimo uses uv to run it in an isolated virtual environment. marimo can even automatically maintain this dependency list on the user’s behalf. Configuration overrides. Users can use script metadata to easily override marimo configuration on a per-notebook basis. Even though marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python, other languages can be used by embedding them in Python. For example, marimo has native support for “SQL cells”, powered by DuckDB or other databases. Though the marimo editor renders these cells as SQL, under the hood they are represented as The marimo parser even statically analyzes SQL code to build a dataflow graph jointly across Python and SQL. Markdown is embedded in marimo notebooks in a similar way: As you can see above, a benefit of embedding other languages in Python is that it enables users to interpolate Python values into SQL and Markdown at runtime. As a final example, our plaintext format makes it easy to edit marimo notebooks in a text editor of your choice; marimo will pick up your changes and reflect them in the browser. The plaintext file format also means you can lint and format notebook files using your preferred tools. While you don’t need to maintain the cell arguments and returns, doing so can help your IDE provide completions. We have changes queued up that will make this feel like a first-class experience. Our file format has tradeoffs — in particular, storing as a Python file means that notebook outputs are no longer serialized in the notebook file. We accommodate output persistence in the following ways: We regularly get feedback from users telling us how much they appreciate marimo’s embrace of pure Python. For example, one user at a large company told us how marimo’s Python-first design means his notebooks are, for the first time, actually reusable and reproducible software artifacts: My colleagues used to ask me what I did to reach certain conclusions … I would just send them my Jupyter notebook, but rarely did it ever actually run properly without issue, and it was always a mystery what specific order I ran the cells in to get them to work. I would end up just redoing a lot of the analysis in pure Python to replicate what was done, which was so inefficient. marimo has definitely solved that issue. Others tell us they came for marimo’s interactivity, but stayed for the ability to run notebooks as scripts. Conversely, others tell us they came for git-versioning, or for the tight integration with uv, and stayed for reactive execution or rich dataframes. Here’s a quote from a user that speaks to this: I haven‘t touched Jupyter or Pandas for a while now and not regretting it. My basic data stack is now uv, polars, marimo. One of my favourite features is that the notebooks are pure Python files and integrate uv script headers to make them out-of-the-box executable. More generally, when we ask our users why they keep using marimo, we hear quotes like this one: Well it just works! It just works. While marimo was originally developed with input from Stanford scientists, it is now used by developers at dozens of companies across the world, including OpenAI, BlackRock, and Moderna; it is also used by researchers and educators at Berkeley, Stanford, NASA, CZI, and other institutions. marimo is quickly establishing itself as a new standard for interactive computing. The marimo package is downloaded hundreds of thousands of times a month, and the marimo GitHub repository has over 11,000 stars, with over 100 contributors.

Title: Elon Musk Is Joining Microsoft in $30 Billion Data Center Project

Elon Musk somehow manages to win again. Microsoft, along with BlackRock and UAE-based MGX, have announced they are partnering with his artificial intelligence startup xAI on a $30 billion project to develop data centers and other infrastructure. Microsoft, being the largest backer of OpenAI, is essentially teaming up with one of its rivals. That relationship has increasingly cooled as Microsoft loosens its reliance on the startup and develops its own in-house AI models including MAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is no fan of Musk, recently describing him as insecure in an interview, and must be screaming inside. Altman probably is not wrong about Musk’s insecurity, but insecurity is a powerful motivator. Gizmodo has reached out to xAI for comment. Musk’s companies do not often respond to media inquiries. The details of the new deal with xAI are unclear, like how much money Musk’s startup will commit to the data center venture. xAI has raised $12 billion since its founding in 2023, nearly the same amount as OpenAI, and is reportedly looking to raise another $10 billion. Its data center in Memphis, dubbed Colossus, is said to be the largest in the world with more than one million GPUs powering the Grok chatbot that is deeply integrated into X. xAI has received criticism for using gas turbines to feed its significant power demands, and receiving significant concessions from the city of Memphis even though data centers usually do not employ many people, and AI threatens to eliminate jobs. Most companies in the space hope to build out nuclear energy to power their demands, which could be a positive for the green energy transition, but building out nuclear takes many years. In the meantime, President Trump has advocated for building out coal power plants next to data centers. Every company in the artificial intelligence space is racing to build out computing infrastructure they believe will be necessary to stand out in an incredibly competitive field. Forming partnerships could help spread the costs of these expansive projects, and Bloomberg reports that other investors might join the Microsoft-xAI project: The Microsoft-backed group will be renamed the AI Infrastructure Partnership, or AIP, and focus on infrastructure investments â including energy projects â mostly in the US, with a portion of the funds to be deployed in partner countries, according to the companies. The plan foresees bringing on additional investors. Clients, including pensions and insurers, are eager for such long-term infrastructure projects, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in the statement. OpenAI early this year announced its own $100 billion infrastructure project with Oracle and SoftBank, one of the earlier signs that it was distancing itself from Microsoft. The big tech company has been building out its own in-house models that could be faster and less expensive to run than ChatGPT, and Microsoft likely does not want to be reliant on an independent company for its AI models if the technology is going to be as revolutionary as many in the industry believe. It is better to control your own destiny than rely on a wild and frenetic company like OpenAI, which has seen a slew of scandals and ongoing drama, including the brief ouster of Altman. The whole thing must be very satisfying to Musk, who clearly launched xAI out of jealousy of OpenAI’s sudden and massive rise. He co-founded the startup, after all, but left following disputes surrounding its direction, only to see the company launch ChatGPT and kickstart a new AI generation. Now he is teaming up with OpenAI’s largest backer on his own rival startup. Musk also continues to try and sue OpenAI over its transition to a for-profit company, among other issues. It is viewed as a convenient way to try and slow OpenAI’s growth as he builds a competitor. Musk’s close relationship with the Trump administration has aided him significantly, even if it has hurt one leg of his empire, Tesla. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that X is now privately valued at $44 billion, the exact same price he paid for what was then called Twitter back in 2022. Once a bastion of coastal elites, X has become something more of a Republican media outlet and microphone to promote President Trump’s agenda. xAI similarly has had no problems raising funding from sovereign wealth funds and others who want to be close to power. OpenAI’s ChatGPT remains far and away the most popular AI chatbot in use today with a reported 400 million weekly users and name recognition that none of its competitors enjoy. xAI is banking on its access to real-time posts from X to differentiate Grok as a powerful chatbot, even though the social network is littered with misinformation. Grok is deeply integrated with X, with buttons allowing users to ask for more context about specific posts. But the general idea seems to be that cozying up to Trump and making X the town square of the Republican party will support xAI’s rise as a major AI player. The chatbot, like all the others, suffers from serious issues producing accurate responses. Last year, Musk gave shares in xAI to investors in his Twitter takeover, as well as preferential access to xAI’s funding rounds, effectively ensuring they would make their money back. The new deal with Microsoft cements xAI as a legitimate player in the AI race. While it remains a major question how impactful AI chatbots will really become in the world, it is understood that should they be as successful as hoped, having access to significant compute will help the few survive. Anyone can run a model like DeepSeek, but “agents” that control computers and do work for users will be resource-intensive, and users will go to competitors if their usage is rate-limited by another.

Title: Fed keeps interest rates unchanged in March

Share this article The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged today, maintaining the federal funds rate between 4.25% and 4.50% for the second consecutive meeting amid growing recession concerns fueled by the Trump administration’s economic policies. The central bank has adjusted its 2025 economic forecasts, lowering GDP growth projections to 1.7% from the previous 2.1% in December, while simultaneously raising forecasts for unemployment to 4.4% from 4.3%, PCE inflation to 2.7% from 2.5%, and core PCE inflation to 2.8% from 2.5%. The Fed projects two 50-basis-point interest rate cuts in 2025, consistent with both market expectations and its December forecast. The decision matched widespread market expectations. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicated a 99% probability of the Fed maintaining its current target interest rates, reflecting near-unanimous market confidence in that outcome. In its FOMC statement, the central bank highlighted a resilient labor market but voiced concerns about persistent inflation and global economic challenges. The Fed indicated it would carefully monitor inflation and labor market data before adjusting policy. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell echoed this cautious approach last month, noting a strong economy that doesn’t yet warrant changes. With his press conference minutes away, markets await clarity on what conditions might prompt future rate moves—and how the Fed views mounting economic risks. This Wednesday’s meeting was the first since the enactment of Trump’s trade policies targeting China, Mexico, and Canada. The Fed had already flagged these tariffs as a source of uncertainty at its January meeting, where rates also held steady. Economists warn that Trump’s tariffs could reverse recent inflation progress by driving up consumer prices and inviting retaliation, potentially straining the economy. US inflation data supports a cooling trend—the consumer price index rose 0.2% in February, lowering the annual rate to 2.8% from 3%, with core CPI also up 0.2%—yet tariff fears persist. In an interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, Trump did not rule out the possibility of a recession. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added to recession concerns on March 10, stating he could not guarantee the US would dodge one. Powell’s upcoming remarks are poised to address these tensions—tariffs, inflation, and recession risks. Since the rate decision met expectations, his words will carry extra weight, potentially shaping market sentiment on whether Trump’s policies could tip the economy into downturn territory. As concerns over tariffs and recession mount, talk about Bitcoin heats up. BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnick, sees a recession as a potential catalyst for Bitcoin, noting that increased liquidity and monetary stimulus could fuel its rise. “Bitcoin is long liquidity in the system. It’s catalyzed by more fiscal spending and debt and deficit accumulation. That happens in a recession,” he said during Yahoo Finance’s Market Domination Overtime on Tuesday. “It’s catalyzed by lower interest rates and monetary stimulus.” Comparing Bitcoin to gold, Mitchnick explained that while Bitcoin is fundamentally an uncorrelated asset, market sentiment sometimes creates short-term price correlations. He argued that Bitcoin should act as a global, decentralized, and non-sovereign asset akin to digital gold but acknowledged that short-term interest rate expectations and investor sentiment could influence its price. Despite recent market pullbacks, Bitcoin is still up approximately 15% since the beginning of November. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: FTC commissioners fired as federal agencies face reckoning

whyframeshot - stock.adobe.com Federal agencies including the Federal Trade Commission, Internal Revenue Service and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are all confronting significant changes as President Donald Trump advances campaign goals of reshaping the federal bureaucracy. Trump on March 18 fired Democratic FTC Commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter. The FTC is composed of five presidentially nominated and Senate-confirmed commissioners to serve seven years. No more than three commissioners can be of the same political party, according to FTC rules. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson and FTC Commissioner Melissa Holyoak, both Republicans, remain on the commission. Mark Meador, a Republican whom Trump has nominated to the FTC, awaits congressional confirmation. After taking office in January, Trump took multiple steps to reduce federal agencies' authority. He issued an executive order freezing agencies from issuing new regulations, followed by another order stipulating that federal employees in policy-influencing positions hold power delegated by the president and "must be accountable to the president." The order contained language asserting that cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining executive leadership have been numerous in recent years. Trump also established the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. DOGE has been closely involved in efforts to assess federal agencies and make cuts, detailing its efforts to eliminate government spending on X, formerly Twitter. As the Trump administration moves ahead with broad agency changes, it creates uncertainty for the business community, said Bill Baer, visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and former antitrust enforcer at both the FTC and Department of Justice (DOJ). "I suppose some in the business community will think it's an opportunity to do things they would not have tried to do before," Baer said. "We just don't know enough to know whether there's going to be dramatic change or very modest shifts in what the priorities are and what the challenges will look like." On X, Bedoya decried being "illegally fired." The former FTC commissioner said he fought for small-town grocers, pharmacists and worker benefits during his time at the FTC. He said he also pushed back against tech companies that "think they can track you and your kids every hour of every day so they can pocket their next billion." Firing the two FTC commissioners strays from the agency's 110-year tradition of being a bipartisan, independent federal agency that offers a complementary approach to the DOJ, said George Hay, an antitrust law professor at Cornell Law School. Congress envisioned the FTC operating independently of the executive branch, he said. "It's a very valuable counterpart to the DOJ," Hay said. "That's the more serious long-term effect." Indeed, Baer said bipartisan debate on antitrust enforcement, competition policies and consumer protection was a significant value-add in the FTC. He also said it doesn't necessarily indicate that the Trump administration will back off antitrust enforcement. Both Ferguson and Gail Slater, assistant attorney general in the DOJ's antitrust division, have stated that they will continue to be assertive in antitrust enforcement, Baer noted. The FTC has drawn backlash from the business community for its internal adjudicative process, which differs from the DOJ's public court proceedings. Rick Smith, CEO of public safety technology vendor Axon Enterprise, testified before a congressional committee earlier this year about harm allegedly caused to his business by an FTC investigation in 2018. Still, Hay said that when making such significant changes to the FTC, "this is not the way to do it." The White House is waging a broader campaign to seize control over the membership and actions of federal regulatory agencies, said William Kovacic, director of the Competition Law Center at the George Washington University and a former FTC chair. Kovacic said the Trump administration has prioritized asserting that there is "no such thing as independent for a regulatory agency." "This is not so much a fight about the FTC as it is about the broader framework of economic regulation at the federal level," he said. The FTC isn't the only federal agency facing changes and policy shifts under the Trump administration. The IRS is reportedly planning mass layoffs. The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents employees in more than 37 federal agencies, said this would be "ill-advised" and a violation of federal law under contractual arrangements between NTEU and the IRS. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau this month dropped seven enforcement cases against several banks and payment services, including Zelle, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, brought under the previous Biden administration. When the CFPB filed the lawsuit against Zelle in December, the company claimed in its response that the CFPB's lawsuit was legally flawed and appeared to be politically motivated. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which coordinates national cybersecurity resilience, also sustained staffing cuts, but reversed course due to a recent court order. Though some judges have challenged Trump's changes to federal agencies and staffing, including CISA staffing, the administration's rapid and overwhelming pace of change makes it difficult for anyone opposing the changes, Kovacic said. "The idea is you bewilder your opponent by the speed of operations," he said. "When you increase pace and speed, and maneuver very quickly, your adversary has a hard time figuring out what's going on. By the time they react, you've moved another 10 steps."

Title: The NBA’s next big insider may be an outsider

Jake Fischer was at a friend’s birthday party when a push notification lit up his phone just after midnight on February 2. His first thought: “That can’t be real.” The incoming tweet from ESPN’s senior NBA insider Shams Charania revealed that the Dallas Mavericks had unexpectedly traded their young superstar Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Dončić trade shocked the basketball world. Why would the Mavericks give away their best player, an ascendant 25-year-old who led them to the NBA Finals last season? BREAKING: The Dallas Mavericks are trading Luka Doncic, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis, Max Christie and a 2029 first-round pick, sources tell ESPN. Three-team deal that includes Utah. — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 2, 2025 Within minutes, a front office employee involved in the trade texted Fischer about it. Then someone from the Mavericks sent a message confirming the deal was, in fact, real. (As word spread, videos surfaced online showing the stunned reactions of fellow NBA players in the middle of their own games.) Soon, people were reaching out to Fischer, who also reports on the inner workings of the NBA, to verify the news. [ Click here to see the future of news in your inbox daily ] It was an especially big moment for sports journalism, which now devotes as much attention to the high drama of player transactions as it does to the actual competition. Once the story broke, Fischer stayed up until 4 a.m. calling around to investigate what happened and gather intel about other possible deals that could occur before the NBA’s February 6 trade deadline. “The way I cover this stuff, I’m always looking for a throughline and a trend that is connecting everything,” he said. “The Luka trade was the easiest way in. You could call anyone in the league and talk about that.” He spoke to contacts across the country, got a few hours of sleep, then picked up his phone as soon as he woke up to do it all again. When he wasn’t talking, he was writing. In the three days leading up to the trade deadline, he published four bylines about the latest NBA news. The NBA insider is a relatively new role in sports media. In the heyday of print journalism, player transactions were often buried in small font without a byline on the last page of the sports section. Today, however, an insider’s job consists of communicating with sources — such as front office executives and agents — and trying to break news before anyone else. One of the biggest challenges is scrutinizing where the details come from. In the NBA, an exchange of favors, rumors, and leaks goes on between league sources and reporters behind the scenes. Agents want to know how the latest whispers might affect the players and coaches they represent. Front office employees want to probe what other teams are thinking, or maybe mislead the competition if it can give them an edge. It’s the insider’s responsibility to confirm what’s real and convey that to the public. The role gained prominence back around 2010 thanks to Adrian Wojnarowski, an NBA writer for Yahoo Sports, who developed a following by posting his intel as quickly as possible on Twitter from his phone, which cut down on the time needed to edit and publish a traditional news article. His scoops got so popular fans gave them a nickname: Woj bombs. And he became such a household name that people bid up to $5,000 during an auction to buy his old iPhones. “There was a perfect storm of interest in the NBA, and then I think 2010 changed interest in free agency,” Wojnarowski said on a podcast last year. “That became its own thing, the trades, the deals, the buildup to the deals.” RELATED ARTICLECan reporters make bets on sports they cover? We asked a dozen newsrooms.Sarah ScireNovember 2, 2023Over time, breaking news also became big business. As a result, insiders turned into valuable media stars. With sports gambling now legal in 38 states, the public craves immediate updates since any news about a player could shift betting odds. In 2015, Wojnarowski emerged as a coveted free agent in his own right, and eventually left Yahoo for ESPN in 2017 after a bidding war. By the time he retired from sports journalism in 2024, he was in the middle of a three-year, $20 million contract from ESPN, meaning he made more money than many of the players he covered. ESPN hired Shams Charania to fill Wojnarowski’s insider role, reportedly for $3 million per year. While insiders typically work for established media companies like ESPN, where they benefit from substantial resources and access to big audiences, Jake Fischer’s position stands out. He operates out of his Brooklyn apartment and publishes scoops behind a paywall on Substack. It’s not even his own Substack. He contributes to The Stein Line, which was launched in 2021 by veteran reporter Marc Stein, who has covered the NBA for over 30 years at outlets including ESPN and The New York Times. The Stein Line currently ranks as the fifth most-popular sports newsletter on Substack, with over 40,000 subscribers. (Stein wouldn’t disclose how many are paid subscribers, but Substack’s leaderboard reveals it’s in the thousands.) Unlike Wojnarowski, who worked as a beat reporter at local newspapers before becoming an award-winning columnist, and Charania, who started trying to be an insider while still in high school, Fischer began his career hoping to write longform magazine features. “I never wanted to be an insider,” he said. Fischer scored an internship at Sports Illustrated in 2015 and stacked his portfolio with human interest articles. He got coffee with an NBA coach obsessed with Starbucks. He chronicled the rigorous routines that two over-40 players went through to stay on the court near the end of their careers. “I made all these relationships around the NBA by writing these non-threatening stories,” he said. During that stretch at Sports Illustrated, Fischer also became friends with Stein. “He kept reporting stuff that made me say, ‘Damn…I wish I had that.’ It was impossible not to take notice of his work,” Stein told me over email. “Gradually, I became a sounding board for him, to the extent that was possible when we were in direct competition.” In 2019, Fischer was part of mass layoffs at Sports Illustrated. He spent a chunk of time putting together a book, Built to Lose: How the NBA’s Tanking Era Changed the League Forever, which doubled as an audition to become an insider because it required interviewing hundreds of executives, players, scouts, and coaches. Next came a stop at Bleacher Report, which Fischer parlayed into the senior NBA reporter role at Yahoo Sports, the same place Wojnarowski built his reputation. However, in 2024, new management took over the site and declined to pick up Fischer’s contract. Soon after, Stein reached out to see if they could work together. “I was very intrigued by it because of the entrepreneurial aspect of being your own boss,” Fischer said. Insider reporting can be a ruthless, zero-sum game. There are only so many scoops to go around, and journalists can be extremely protective of their sources. That makes Stein and Fischer an interesting team. Fischer refers to Stein as his “work dad” and keeps his contact info pinned to the top of the Messages app on his computer. They share intel and co-byline stories. As Stein says, “We have access to more sources who can help with confirmations if we join forces on a given story.” Most articles containing in-depth reporting sit behind the paywall, but they periodically publish free stories on Substack in addition to revealing scoops on social media. They also have more room to experiment on Substack; for example, they host exclusive chats on the platform, where they take questions from paid subscribers about the latest NBA rumors and theories. In a rare mid-season move, Rip City Remix guard Isaac Nogués Gonzaléz is submitting paperwork to enter the 2025 NBA Draft. “I can defend a lot of positions. Not only the point guard. Not only the best player,” he told me. More here @TheSteinLine: https://t.co/EoT0fxXrq9 pic.twitter.com/rwvqq5xqNp — Jake Fischer (@JakeLFischer) March 3, 2025 Their approach stands out in other ways as well. “We always say we try to be as gentlemanly as possible,” Fischer explained. For example, he tries not to call anyone before 10 a.m. When thinking through the language of scoops, he cares about avoiding certain phrases like “shopping a player,” which can have a negative, almost dehumanizing connotation. Even Fischer’s appearance differs from the typical corporate polish of NBA insiders. He’s scruffy and has long hair that’s smoothed back close to his shoulders. “When a college kid asks me, ‘How do you develop sources?’ I tell them right away, ‘Stop trying to develop sources,’” Fischer said. “Just meet people and treat them as a person.” The attitude sounds both strange and refreshing, but in some ways, it may prevent Fischer from doing whatever is necessary to get a scoop. In the world of insiders, there’s a fine line between source and friend. Wojnarowski, for example, faced criticism for publishing favorable stories about certain sources. However, access isn’t guaranteed, and if a source gets burned with incorrect information, they may never pick up the phone again. “There are so many more walls to smash through today to find that same level of proximity to players, coaches, [and] front offices compared to what I faced for the first two-thirds of my career,” Stein said. [ Click here to see the future of news in your inbox daily ] A few years ago, an agent vowed that his entire agency would never talk to Fischer again after the young reporter relayed bad information. This year, though, that agent called Fischer more than anyone else in the week leading up to the deadline, asking what he’d heard about one client, who ended up getting traded. “I feel like if you treat people well, they always come back,” Fischer said. That mentality may be why he’s managed to carve out a unique role for himself in a constantly evolving sports media landscape. In addition to writing for The Stein Line, Fischer also produces freelance NBA video content for Bleacher Report. Speaking of video, last summer, the NBA agreed to an 11-year, $76 billion new media rights deal that will change how fans can watch games. As part of the deal, streaming services like Amazon and NBC’s Peacock will broadcast some games starting next season. New NBA media partners could also mean new professional opportunities for an insider like Fischer. Fischer told me he had “very cursory conversations” with some of the new media partners back in the fall as they began building out their broadcast teams. Now that the trade deadline is over, those conversations should pick back up. While Fischer could see himself collaborating with Stein for the rest of his career, he’d also welcome the chance to supplement his Substack writing with more on-camera work. “But I would try to do it in my own way,” he said with a grin. “And I’m not cutting my hair.” Jordan Teicher is a freelance writer based in New Jersey.

PROPERTY PRICES CLIMBED by 8.1% in the 12 months to January this year, according to figures released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). In January, property prices rose for the 17th month in a row, leaving the average cost significantly higher than at the peak of the Celtic Tiger property boom in 2007. The CSO’s latest property price index shows that the median price of a home sold in Ireland was €359,999 in the last year. Prices in Dublin rose by 7.5%, while prices outside Dublin were up by 8.6% compared with January 2024. The highest median price for a property was €662,349 in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €180,000 in Leitrim.

Clones, Co Monaghan, had the least expensive price of €133,000. Advertisement The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the north and north-west (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo) at 12.7%, while at the other end of the scale, the mid-east (Kildare, Louth, Meath, and Wicklow) saw a 5.8% rise. House prices rose by 8.5%, while apartment prices climbed by 5.8%. The continued property price increases were announced just one day after the Central Bank’s latest forecasts show it estimates the Government will miss its housing targets over the next three years. This year, the Central Bank estimated that 35,000 homes will be built – 6,000 less than the revised government targets. Rachel McGovern, Deputy Chief Executive at Brokers Ireland, said this is exacerbating the home ownership desires of huge swathes of the population. “The Central Bank’s report yesterday is just the latest in a string of reports pointing to the loss of momentum in the housing market,” she said. McGovern added that there needs to be “a shake-up” in the State’s response to housing. “We need to hear less about targets and more about solid initiatives to change policy, such as the new Strategic Housing & Infrastructure Delivery Office promised in the Programme for Government 2025,” McGovern said. “We need to hear what is being done to speed up housing infrastructure such as water services and land re-zoning.” She said the Government needs to be “brave and decisive” and not let another year pass before it acts on the recommendations of the Housing Commission.

Title: Страхование и климатическая устойчивость морских и прибрежных районов

Full Content:
ЛОНДОН – Изменение климата ставит под угрозу прибрежные и морские экосистемы, от устойчивости которых зависит глобальная стабильность, экономическое процветание и выживание всего живого на Земле. Нужно срочно защитить эти экосистемы, но у многих жителей прибрежных районов нет финансовых ресурсов даже на восстановление после климатических бедствий – ураганов, тайфунов и штормовых приливов. Критически важно устранить этот недостаток, чтобы смягчить худшие последствия изменения климата. Мощным фактором позитивных изменений может стать страховая отрасль, повышая с помощью методов риск-менеджмента долгосрочную климатическую устойчивость прибрежных районов и океанов. После урагана «Берил», обрушившегося на Карибский бассейн и Мексиканский залив в июле прошлого года, стала очевидна необходимость целевых страховых решений в климатически уязвимых районах. Ураган повредил или уничтожил почти 90% всего рыболовного флота Барбадоса. Лишившись доходов и не имея достаточного страхового покрытия, многие рыбаки и их семьи остались без средств на восстановление. Несмотря на возросшие риски, страховщики признают, что с хорошо продуманными продуктами, точной оценкой рисков и мерами повышения устойчивости можно сделать климатически уязвимые рынки финансово привлекательными. Во многих случаях партнёрства с госсектором и организациями развития, помогающие разделить риски и повысить уровень защиты, дополнительно стимулируют страховщиков оставаться на рынке. Тем самым страховщики не только сохраняют важный сегмент рынка, но и способствуют устойчивости в прибрежных районах. Одно из перспективных решений – полисы параметрического страхования. Эти полисы играют роль финансовой защиты для частных лиц, малого бизнеса и даже стран после природных катастроф, гарантируя мгновенные выплаты, которые помогают населению и правительствам быстро восстановиться. Не менее важно то, что параметрические полисы играют ключевую роль в смягчении рисков, поскольку позволяют правительствам и бизнесу инвестировать в долгосрочные стратегии устойчивости. Ярким примером такого решения на государственном уровне стал полис параметрического страхования для Белиза британско-американской страховой компании WTW. Он призван обеспечить обслуживание страной долга по «синим облигациям». Этот инновационный финансовый механизм автоматически выдаёт средства в случае наступления заранее оговорённых природных событий, что гарантирует выполнение Белизом долговых обязательств и достижение поставленных целей климатической устойчивости даже после природных катастроф.

Subscribe Now Помимо снижения рисков, страхование может сыграть важную роль в привлечении частного капитала в проекты, повышающие климатическую устойчивость. Долгосрочные институциональные инвесторы, включая страховщиков, обладают огромными капиталами, которые можно направить на создание устойчивой инфраструктуры. Однако до сих пор очень трудно привлекать эти средства, особенно в масштабные проекты в развивающихся странах и регионах с высокими рисками. Фонд развития устойчивой инфраструктуры (IRDF) – совместная инициатива Форума развития страхования (IDF) и компании BlackRock – пытается решить эту проблему, привлекая капиталы страховой отрасли для инвестиций в устойчивую инфраструктуру в развивающихся странах. Фонд поддерживает коммерческие проекты (предполагающие строительство с нуля или перестройку существующих объектов) в таких отраслях, как возобновляемая энергетика, водоснабжение, управление отходами, транспорт, телекоммуникации. Подтверждая соответствие проектов страховым требованиям, связанным с кредитоспособностью и рисками, фонд открывает канал столь необходимого финансирования инфраструктуры в этих странах (включая инвестиции в природные решения), особенно в прибрежных районах, что способствует повышению долгосрочной климатической устойчивости. Другой пример – «Компания синих гарантий Nautilus». Это совместная инициатива Альянса за повышение устойчивости и снижение рисков океана (ORRAA) и Группы гарантий развития (DGG); её поддержало правительство Британии. Nautilus использует гарантии (по сути, страхование инвестиций) для масштабного привлечения частного капитала в проекты повышения прибрежной и океанической устойчивости. Nautilus предлагает структуру «обещанных выплат», которая снижает риски дефолта для инвесторов, и старается, опираясь на собственные капиталы, поддерживать проекты устойчивой синей экономики, начиная с малых и средних предприятий и заканчивая крупными инфраструктурными проектами. Такая стратегия помогает уменьшить воспринимаемые риски, повысить уверенность инвесторов и привлечь частное финансирование в океанические инициативы во всём мире, способствующие климатической устойчивости и регенерации экосистем. Чтобы уменьшить дефицит защиты устойчивой синей экономики, мы должны создавать партнёрства между страховыми компаниями, инвесторами и властями, задействуя опыт, знания и ресурсы как государственного, так и частного сектора. Такие частно-государственные партнёрства будут преследовать одну цель: помогать находить инновационные решения для климатической адаптации и управления рисками, которые помогут уязвимым группам населения. Совместная работа участников форума IDF и альянса ORRAA стала ярким примером использования государственных, частных и филантропических ресурсов для масштабного увеличения инвестиций в природные решения (защиту коралловых рифов, восстановление мангровых зарослей и так далее). Объединив суверенные риски, островные государства смогли вместе получить доступ к недорогому страхованию и показали ещё один полезный пример повышения финансовой устойчивости в условиях климатических катастроф. На Форуме синих финансов и экономики и Конференции ООН по океану, которые пройдут в июне в Монако и Ницце, будет подчеркиваться возросшая роль страховой отрасли в повышении климатической устойчивости океанов. Но для значимого прогресса нужна многогранная стратегия расширения доступа к таким видам страхования, как параметрическое покрытие. Повысить доступность и адаптировать страхование к местным реалиям можно, инвестируя в сбор данных и моделирование рисков, что улучшит наше понимание и оценку угроз, связанных с океаном. «Индекс прибрежных рисков», публикуемый ORRAA и AXA, показывает, как подходы с опорой на данные могут радикально улучшить ситуацию с климатической устойчивостью. Но что, наверное, самое важное, учитывая беспрецедентные масштабы климатической проблемы, для обеспечения защиты потребуются комплексные подходы, которые объединят знания отрасли о риск-менеджменте, инновационные финансовые инструменты, стратегическое использование капиталов. Массовое внедрение природных страховых продуктов позволит не только уменьшить физические риски, но и поддержит биоразнообразие, здоровье экосистем. Укрепляя природную береговую защиту, мы сможем полностью раскрыть экономический и экологический потенциал устойчивого океана, создать процветающую синюю экономику.

LONDRES – El cambio climático es una amenaza creciente para los ecosistemas costeros y marinos, de cuya resiliencia dependen la estabilidad mundial, la prosperidad económica y la supervivencia de todas las formas de vida en la Tierra. Pese a la urgencia de tomar medidas que protejan estos ecosistemas, muchas comunidades costeras carecen de los recursos financieros necesarios para recuperarse de desastres relacionados con el clima como huracanes, tifones y marejadas ciclónicas. Para mitigar los peores efectos del cambio climático, es fundamental cubrir el faltante de financiación; y en esto, la industria de los seguros puede ser un poderoso motor de cambio positivo, poniendo sus soluciones de gestión de riesgos al servicio de fortalecer la resiliencia costera y oceánica a largo plazo. El huracán Beryl, que en julio del año pasado arrasó el Caribe y el golfo de México, puso de relieve la necesidad de mecanismos de aseguramiento específicos para las regiones vulnerables al clima, ya que la tormenta dañó o destruyó casi el 90% de la flota pesquera de Barbados. Privados de ingresos y con poca o ninguna cobertura de seguro, muchos pescadores y sus comunidades se quedaron sin medios para la reconstrucción. A pesar del aumento de riesgos, las aseguradoras saben que con productos bien diseñados, una adecuada cotización de aquellos y el fortalecimiento de las medidas de resiliencia es posible dar viabilidad financiera a mercados vulnerables al clima. En muchos casos, acuerdos de asociación con gobiernos y organismos de desarrollo que permitan compartir riesgos y resolver deficiencias en el área de las medidas de protección pueden alentar a las aseguradoras a seguir en el mercado. Permaneciendo en estas regiones, las aseguradoras no sólo conservan un importante segmento del mercado, sino que también ayudan a crear comunidades costeras más resilientes. Una solución prometedora son las pólizas de seguro paramétricas. Están diseñadas para ofrecer una red de seguridad financiera después de una catástrofe ambiental a individuos, pequeñas empresas e incluso países, con una entrega rápida de desembolsos que ayuden a comunidades y gobiernos a acelerar las medidas de recuperación. Además, las pólizas paramétricas cumplen un papel fundamental en la mitigación de riesgos, al permitir a gobiernos y empresas invertir en estrategias de resiliencia a largo plazo. Un ejemplo notable de solución en el nivel nacional es la póliza paramétrica de la aseguradora británico‑estadounidense WTW para Belice, diseñada para ayudar al país a cumplir los pagos de sus bonos azules. Este innovador mecanismo financiero libera fondos en forma automática si se producen determinados fenómenos ambientales, de modo tal que Belice pueda cumplir sus obligaciones financieras y sus objetivos de resiliencia climática incluso después de una catástrofe natural.

Subscribe Now Además de su función de transferir riesgos, las pólizas de seguro también pueden facilitar la movilización de capital privado para proyectos de creación de resiliencia. Los inversores institucionales con un horizonte temporal largo (entre ellos las aseguradoras) poseen grandes reservas de capital que pueden destinarse a la inversión en infraestructuras sostenibles. Pero liberar estos fondos sigue siendo difícil, sobre todo para proyectos a gran escala en países en desarrollo y regiones de alto riesgo. En respuesta a esta dificultad, el Fondo para el Desarrollo de Resiliencia en Infraestructuras, una iniciativa conjunta del Insurance Development Forum (IDF) y BlackRock, apunta a movilizar capital del sector asegurador hacia la inversión en infraestructuras resilientes en economías en desarrollo y emergentes. El fondo da apoyo a proyectos comerciales de desarrollo o reutilización de terrenos en sectores como las energías renovables, el agua, la gestión de residuos, el transporte y las telecomunicaciones. Certificando que los proyectos cumplen los requisitos crediticios y de riesgo de las aseguradoras, ofrece un canal a la muy necesaria financiación de infraestructuras en estos países, incluida la inversión en soluciones basadas en la naturaleza, sobre todo en comunidades costeras, con lo que promueve la sostenibilidad a largo plazo. Otro ejemplo es Nautilus, the Blue Guarantee Company, una iniciativa conjunta de la Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA) y del Development Guarantee Group, con el apoyo del gobierno británico. Nautilus utiliza garantías (básicamente, seguros de inversión) para liberar capital privado a gran escala con destino a proyectos de resiliencia costera y oceánica. Mediante una estructura de «promesa de pago» que reduce los riesgos de incumplimiento para los inversores, Nautilus busca poner su base de capital al servicio de respaldar proyectos de economía azul sostenibles, desde pequeñas y medianas empresas hasta proyectos de infraestructura a gran escala. Esta estrategia puede mitigar los riesgos percibidos y mejorar la confianza de los inversores, de modo tal de atraer financiación privada a iniciativas oceánicas regenerativas y con resiliencia al cambio climático en todo el mundo. Para cubrir los faltantes de protección en la economía azul sostenible, también es necesario fomentar acuerdos de asociación entre compañías de seguros, inversores y gobiernos, que permitan aprovechar la experiencia y los recursos de los sectores público y privado. Estas asociaciones público‑privadas compartirían un mismo objetivo: facilitar soluciones innovadoras de adaptación y gestión de riesgos que beneficien a comunidades vulnerables. El trabajo de los miembros del IDF con la ORRAA es un buen ejemplo de cómo aprovechar los recursos públicos, privados y filantrópicos para aumentar las inversiones en soluciones basadas en la naturaleza, por ejemplo la protección de arrecifes de coral y la restauración de manglares. Otro modelo útil para aumentar la resiliencia financiera frente a desastres relacionados con el clima son los fondos de riesgo soberano, que permiten a los estados insulares acceder a coberturas de seguro asequibles en forma conjunta. El próximo Foro sobre Economía y Finanzas Azules y la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Océanos, que se celebrarán en Mónaco y Niza en junio, ponen de relieve el papel cada vez más importante del sector de los seguros en la creación de resiliencia oceánica. Pero para lograr avances significativos se necesita una estrategia multifacética que amplíe el acceso a soluciones de seguro como la cobertura paramétrica. Para que la cobertura sea más accesible y adaptada a las realidades locales, debemos invertir en datos y modelos de riesgo que mejoren nuestra comprensión, evaluación y cotización de las amenazas relacionadas con los océanos. El Índice de Riesgo Costero de la ORRAA y AXA demuestra de qué manera un enfoque basado en datos puede generar grandes mejoras en resiliencia climática. Pero lo más importante tal vez sea que por la escala inédita del desafío climático, la solución a los faltantes de protección demanda un enfoque holístico que integre las capacidades de gestión de riesgos del sector asegurador, instrumentos financieros innovadores y un empleo estratégico del capital. La adopción generalizada de productos de seguro basados en la naturaleza no sólo mitigará los riesgos físicos, sino que también dará apoyo a la biodiversidad y a la salud de los ecosistemas. Con el fortalecimiento de las defensas costeras naturales, podemos liberar todo el potencial económico y ecológico de un océano resiliente y crear una próspera economía azul.

Title: Insuring Coastal and Ocean Resilience

Protecting high-risk coastal communities from the worst effects of climate change requires increased investment in critical adaptation and mitigation projects. With innovative tools like parametric policies, the insurance industry is uniquely positioned to drive long-term climate resilience. LONDON – Climate change poses a growing threat to coastal and marine ecosystems, whose resilience is vital for global stability, economic prosperity, and the survival of all life on Earth. While urgent action is necessary to protect these ecosystems, many coastal communities lack the financial resources needed to recover from climate-related disasters like hurricanes, typhoons, and storm surges. Closing the financing gap is critical to mitigating the worst effects of climate change – and the insurance industry can be a powerful driver of positive change, leveraging risk-management solutions to strengthen long-term coastal and ocean resilience. Hurricane Beryl, which tore through the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico last July, underscored the need for targeted insurance solutions in climate-vulnerable regions, as the storm damaged or destroyed nearly 90% of Barbados’s fishing fleet. With no income and little to no insurance coverage, many fishers and their communities were left without the means to rebuild. Despite the heightened risks, insurers recognize that well-designed products, accurate risk pricing, and strengthened resilience measures can make climate-vulnerable markets financially viable. In many cases, partnerships with governments and development organizations to share risk and address protection gaps further encourages insurers to stay in the market. By remaining in these regions, insurers not only preserve an important market segment but also help build more resilient coastal communities. Parametric insurance policies offer one such promising solution. These policies are designed to serve as a financial safety net for individuals, small businesses, and even countries following environmental disasters, ensuring rapid payouts that help communities and governments recover faster. Equally important, parametric policies play a key role in risk mitigation, enabling governments and businesses to invest in long-term resilience strategies. A notable example of a country-level solution is the British-American insurer WTW’s parametric insurance policy for Belize, designed to support the country’s ability to service its blue-bond debt. This innovative financial mechanism automatically releases funds when predefined environmental events occur, ensuring that Belize can meet its debt obligations and achieve its climate-resilience goals even after natural disasters.

Subscribe Now Beyond risk transfer, insurance can be instrumental in mobilizing private capital for resilience-building projects. Long-term institutional investors, including insurers, hold vast capital reserves that can be directed toward sustainable infrastructure. But unlocking these funds remains a challenge, particularly for large-scale projects in developing countries and high-risk regions. The Infrastructure Resilience Development Fund, a joint initiative of the Insurance Development Forum (IDF) and BlackRock, seeks to tackle this challenge by mobilizing insurance-sector capital for investments in resilient infrastructure in developing and emerging economies. The Fund supports greenfield and brownfield commercial projects in sectors such as renewable energy, water, waste management, transportation, and telecommunications. By certifying that projects meet insurers’ credit and risk requirements, it offers a channel for much-needed financing of infrastructure in these countries, including investments in nature-based solutions, particularly in coastal communities, thereby promoting long-term sustainability. Another example is Nautilus, the Blue Guarantee Company, a joint initiative of the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA) and the Development Guarantee Group, supported by the UK government. Nautilus uses guarantees – essentially investment insurance – to unlock private capital at scale for coastal and ocean resilience projects. By offering a “promise to pay” structure that reduces default risks for investors, Nautilus aims to leverage its capital base to back sustainable blue economy ventures, ranging from small- and medium-size enterprises to large-scale infrastructure projects. Such a strategy could mitigate perceived risks and enhance investor confidence, attracting private financing to climate-resilient and regenerative ocean initiatives around the world. To close the sustainable blue economy protection gap, we must also foster partnerships among insurance companies, investors, and policymakers to harness the expertise and resources of the public and private sectors. These public-private partnerships would share a single goal: facilitating innovative adaptation and risk-management solutions that benefit vulnerable communities. IDF members’ work with ORRAA is a prime example of leveraging public, private, and philanthropic resources to scale up investments in nature-based solutions like coral-reef protection and mangrove restoration. Sovereign risk pools, which enable island states to band together and access affordable insurance coverage, are another useful model for greater financial resilience in the face of climate-related disasters. The upcoming Blue Economy and Finance Forum and the United Nations Ocean Conference, which will be held in Monaco and Nice in June, underscore the insurance sector’s growing role in building ocean resilience. But achieving meaningful progress requires a multifaceted strategy for expanding access to insurance solutions like parametric coverage. To make coverage more accessible and tailored to local realities, we must invest in data and risk modeling, thereby improving our understanding, assessment, and pricing of ocean-related threats. ORRAA and AXA’s Coastal Risk Index demonstrates how a data-driven approach can drastically improve climate resilience. Perhaps most importantly, given the unprecedented scale of the climate challenge, closing the protection gap demands a holistic approach that integrates industry risk-management capabilities, innovative financial instruments, and strategic capital deployment. The widespread adoption of nature-based insurance products will not only mitigate physical risks but also support biodiversity and ecosystem health. By strengthening natural coastal defenses, we can unlock the full economic and ecological potential of a resilient ocean and create a thriving blue economy.

Two chipmaking giants are joining forces. Yum! Brands (YUM+0.02%) has tapped Nvidia (NVDA+0.78%) to accelerate the use of AI across its global restaurant network. Joe Park, Yum chief digital and technology officer, said the goal of the partnership is to create easier experiences for customers and employees, and provide franchises with “better, faster, cheaper, and safer technology,” while maximizing shareholder returns. The collaboration will focus on three key areas for Yum: voice AI ordering for drive-thrus and call centers, computer vision to optimize operational efficiency, and restaurant intelligence, using AI-generated analytics to boost performance. Pilot programs for these technologies are already underway in select Taco Bell and Pizza Hut locations across the U.S., with plans for a broader rollout targeting 500 restaurants across all Yum brands in the second quarter. Yum also owns KFC and Habit Burger & Grill. Taco Bell has been exploring AI for several years. In July 2024, chief innovation officer Lawrence Kim said Yum had been testing AI voice technology for two years. By then, over 100 Taco Bell drive-thrus in 13 states had already implemented the technology. As the AI race intensifies among tech giants, restaurants are increasingly adopting the technology to stay competitive. AI has already become a mainstay in Big Food, with chains like McDonalds (MCD+0.20%), Chick-fil-A, and Wendy’s (WEN+0.33%) using it to streamline operations, reduce labor costs, and boost efficiency. Chick-fil-A is using robots to cut and squeeze lemons, while Wendy’s is using AI to help it manage Frosty demand. This partnership marks Nvidia’s first venture into the restaurant sector. It also signals a strategic shift for Yum, which has historically built its tech operations through acquisitions. By partnering with Nvidia, Yum will own the AI intelligence created, allowing it to customize the technology to its needs. Although the financial terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed, both Yum and Nvidia have seen stock growth, with Yum up 14% over the past year and Nvidia’s stock rising 35%.

Elon Musk’s xAI and chipmaker Nvidia have joined a $30 billion artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure project. The AI Infrastructure Fund, backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX, announced the two-high profile sign-ups Wednesday (March 19), noting that their ultimate goal was to raise up to $100 billion for artificial intelligence (AI) development. “The global buildout of AI infrastructure will benefit every company and country that wants to achieve economic growth and unlock solutions to the world’s greatest challenges,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in the announcement. “AI factories built on Nvidia full-stack AI infrastructure will convert data into intelligence that will accelerate every industry and help society achieve unimaginable breakthroughs,” he added. Microsoft and Blackrock launched the fund last year, aiming to raise money to construct data centers and find sources of power for those facilities. The announcement comes one day after Huang told attendees at the Nvidia developer conference that massive computing power is required to enable the current trajectory of AI as it moves toward agents and reasoning models. “AI is going through an inflection point,” the CEO said at the event, nicknamed “AI Woodstock,” adding that the shift to agentic and reasoning means “the amount of computation necessary to train those models, and to inference those models, has grown tremendously.” Traditional large language models need much less computing power than AI agents and reasoning models, but they also answer immediately. Reasoning models need much more power because they go back and forth reasoning among themselves before responding, which in many cases would take longer. “In order for us to keep the model responsive, so that we don’t lose our patience waiting for it to think, we now have to compute 10 times faster,” Huang said. “The amount of computation we have to do is 100 times more, easily.” As PYMNTS noted, Huang was making the case that the AI industry will still require a lot of Nvidia GPUs following a flurry of news in January surrounding the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. That company said it had trained its high-performing foundation AI model using only 2,000 slower Nvidia H800 chips instead of typically tens of thousands or more for companies like OpenAI. The BlackRock/Microsoft fund isn’t the only multi-billion dollar effort to finance AI infrastructure projects. In January, SoftBank and OpenAI unveiled their “Stargate” project to develop AI infrastructure, with plans to spend up to $100 billion.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo HONG KONG, March 19 (Reuters) – Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison is facing intense criticism from Beijing over its ports sale to a BlackRock-led consortium, fueling speculation as to whether China could take steps to scupper the deal. China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office has reposted two state media commentaries over the past week depicting the deal, which includes the sale of assets near the Panama Canal, as a betrayal of China and contrary to its national interests. The deal could give BlackRock control of 10.4% of global container throughput, making it the world’s third largest port operator, Chinese state media reported, which could result in higher port and logistics costs for Chinese entities and pose a risk to Chinese supply chains. Here’s a look at what potential legal or policy levers Beijing and Hong Kong could deploy against the company. While some analysts say China’s regulatory reach is limited as none of the ports being sold are in China or Hong Kong, some legal experts say Beijing could still review the transaction. The State Administrative Market Regulation Authority could have extra-territorial jurisdiction by applying the anti-monopoly law, if a deal outside mainland China has the effect of eliminating or restricting competition in China’s domestic market. Authorities could also use the Measures for Security Review or Foreign Investments, implemented in 2021, to examine foreign direct investments in important fields relating to national security, including infrastructure. Felix Ng, a partner at law firm Haldanes, said the measures removed the exclusion of acquisitions of interest held by foreign companies, “suggesting that PRC authorities may have the power to review foreign-to-foreign transactions if the target involves PRC-related entities”. While CK Hutchison is registered offshore, it has businesses and a presence in China and Beijing may be able to use this as justification for weighing in, Ng said. The company did not respond to questions about the potential scrutiny. Lawyers said Hong Kong lacked regulations requiring government screening of sales of strategic assets, reflecting its traditional role as a free-wheeling entrepot. That left the government with few options beyond the blunt and broad instrument of the 2020 National Security Law to probe foreign deals involving local firms. The Beijing-imposed law punishes terrorism, collusion with foreign forces, subversion and secession with possible life imprisonment. “Given the sensitivities, there would be room for further investigation under the broad sweep of the National Security Law, particularly over collusion or espionage,” said Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong law school. The offense of collusion would have to involve a person or company intending to disrupt the policies of the Chinese or Hong Kong governments to create serious consequences, Young said. Likewise, espionage would have to involve a person intending to endanger national security by communicating or providing information useful to an external force. “I don’t know if there is evidence of an intention to endanger national security by entering into the ports agreement,” he said. The Hong Kong government did not respond to a request for comment. While some politicians and analysts also say it’s hard to see how the deal could violate security laws, the Secretary for Security can give notice that relevant persons or organizations must not, directly or indirectly, deal with a property that is reasonably suspected to be related to offenses endangering national security. The Secretary for Justice, the Secretary for Security or a police officer may exercise the power to freeze, restrain, confiscate and forfeit property relating to the commission of an offense endangering national security. Article 29 of the law states that an act “seriously disrupting the formulation and implementation of laws or policies” by the Chinese and Hong Kong governments “which is likely to cause serious consequences” could constitute an offense under collusion with foreign forces. The law also has an extrajudicial scope, and applies to both residents and non-residents. Hong Kong authorities used the security legislation and the implementation rules in 2021 to freeze the assets of Next Digital, invoking powers to force the liquidation of the listed company of jailed pro-democracy tycoon Jimmy Lai.

Title: Elon Musk’s AI Start-Up and Nvidia Join Microsoft, BlackRock, MGX AI Fund

Two of the biggest forces in artificial intelligence (AI) — Elon Musk’s xAI and Nvidia — have joined BlackRock, Microsoft and investment fund MGX’s group to expand AI infrastructure across the U.S., the companies announced Wednesday. The fund — called the AI Infrastructure Partnership — at its formation in September of last year, said that it plans to launch with more than $30 billion in initial funding. The goal is to build data centers and energy projects which are required to power large-scale AI models. Nvidia will also serve as a technical advisor for the group, which it had announced last year. Musk and Nvidia join the effort two months after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the formation of Stargate, a private venture that plans to build up to 20 large AI data centers in the U.S. in partnership with OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. The first data center will be built in Abilene, a small city in Texas, which will be completed by mid-2026, Bloomberg reported yesterday. It will have space for roughly 400,000 of Nvidia’s AI chips and a capacity of 1.2 gigawatts of power.

Title: The Evolution of Structured Crypto Products
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/03/19/the-evolution-of-structured-crypto-products
Time Published: 2025-03-19T15:26:27Z
Full Content:
Australia-based digital asset firm Zerocap is in a prime position to observe the development of the structured product space, having operated OTC, market making, derivatives and crypto custody businesses since it was founded in 2018. Here Zerocap’s head of sales Mark Hiriart discusses how these products are changing, a new semi-principal protected product his firm is launching, how demand for structured products varies by geographical region, and the most unusual structured product request he’s seen. Tell us about Zerocap. Zerocap is Australia's leading institutional digital assets firm, established in 2018. We operate multiple business lines including an OTC desk, market making and derivatives business, all underpinned by our custody offering. We operate as a Corporate Authorised Representative of an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) holder, which authorizes us to trade financial products like derivatives with wholesale accredited investors. We have also established a number of high-profile partnerships with institutions like ANZ Bank for their stablecoin, and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) for various proof of concepts and pilots. While we've become the leading liquidity player in Australia over the last 18 months, our reach extends to clients in over 50 countries. You recently announced a new product — tell us about it. We've partnered with CoinDesk Indices to launch a semi-principal-protected structure on the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20). The product offers upside exposure to the CD20 with principal protection limiting downside risk to 5%, while offering up to 40% return potential on the upside. This is the first in a series of structured products we'll be creating with CoinDesk Indices, featuring different payoffs for various risk appetites. The timing is particularly relevant given the current market sentiment. With the rally in digital assets around Trump and potential global trade headwinds to navigate, we anticipate some sideways action in the near term. This medium-risk exposure product is well-suited to the current macro environment. What gap in the market does your new product fill, and who is it designed for? In the digital asset space, we don't have established benchmarks like there are in traditional markets. For example, if an Australian investor or someone in Hong Kong wants U.S. tech exposure, they typically look for products linked to the NASDAQ or QQQ ETF. In crypto, we haven't had that level of indexization yet. This product is designed for three groups: family offices and high-net-worth individuals seeking to enter the space; investors wanting broad-based crypto exposure without deep diving into individual assets; and those who understand bitcoin but want diversified exposure with managed risk. Why did you choose to base it on the CoinDesk 20 Index? We selected the CoinDesk 20 Index for four key reasons. One, we deeply respect the CoinDesk brand and their index team's quality. Two, our strong relationship with Bullish provides access to futures contracts for hedging. Three, there's a clear market need for index products in the crypto space. And lastly, my background in equity derivatives at investment banks shows me how people use these products, and it's a natural evolution for crypto. How are structured products evolving? Two main factors have historically limited structured product adoption: one, high crypto volatility meant simple spot positions could provide significant returns, and two, the prevalence of perpetual futures with high leverage reduced demand for options markets. That balance is shifting, however, as more participants hold structural positions. Venture funds, portfolio managers with value-based allocation policies and large mandate holders need specific hedging solutions that perpetuals can't provide due to path dependency. What impact is the advent of crypto ETFs having on structured products? ETFs serve as a "gateway drug" to structured products rather than cannibalizing them. The introduction of products like the BlackRock ETF has brought new participants into the crypto space. As these investors become comfortable with crypto exposure through ETFs, they naturally progress to exploring more sophisticated products for enhanced returns or risk management. What institutional demand patterns are you seeing for crypto structured products in Asia versus other regions? Asia typically shows a strong appetite for auto-call structures, where investors sell downside or puts to receive large coupons based on price targets on the upside. This differs from the more conservative approach in U.S. and European markets. Having worked at JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley in equity derivatives trading, I've seen these regional differences firsthand. Australia sits somewhere in between, and at Zerocap, we've successfully converted non-structured product players into crypto structured product users. We're looking to expand this expertise into Asia, subject to regulatory requirements. Are we at risk of over-engineering crypto's volatility out of existence? As crypto develops, different assets naturally have different volatility profiles. While stablecoins maintain stability and bitcoin's volatility may dampen with institutional adoption, there's still plenty of opportunity for high-volatility exposure down the market cap curve, from Solana to memecoins. The market is maturing to cater to different investor needs. For portfolio allocation, whether it's 1%, 2% or 5%, investors need broad beta exposure through established assets like bitcoin and ether, complemented by smaller allocations to emerging opportunities. What’s been the most unusual structured product request you’ve seen? We are one of the few desks globally that offer derivatives on alt coins and hence we get asked to price some wild and wacky things. I can officially confirm that we have traded an option on FARTCOIN recently, which is quite something for someone who has spent his career at the big US banks! With that in mind, where do you see DeFi and traditional structured products intersecting? While DeFi and structured products present interesting opportunities, we need to acknowledge that crypto is already complex, and structured products add another layer of complexity. However, tokenization makes sense for legal documentation and fungibility, since you can audit source code to understand exactly what you're getting. This space will grow with real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, but widespread adoption may take time. When do you think digital assets will become long-term investments? The transition from trading vehicles to long-term investments will occur as protocols and tokens demonstrate clear value propositions and use cases. Bitcoin has proven itself to be viewed as digital gold, while it is still debatable to callEthereum "ultrasound money”. Other protocols are still fighting to find their niche and demonstrate tangible value in the digital economy. As these assets become more integrated into economic systems, their long-term value propositions will become more measurable. For more information visit https://zerocap.com/.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Merck & Co. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/MRK or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Nvidia delivered again at the GTC, but it wasn't enough for everyone

Nvidia (NVDA+0.78%) unveiled more about its next artificial intelligence chips, humanoid robots, and AI supercomputers at its GPU Technology Conference on Tuesday — but some investors wanted more. The chipmaker’s stock fell by more than 3% after the annual developer conference, also known as the GTC. The stock reversed course during pre-market trading on Wednesday, and was up by 2.2% at the open. Later in the morning, Nvidia’s shares were up by 1.2%. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company’s Blackwell chips — which were announced at the last GTC — are now in full production after hitting snags last year. The next Blackwell Ultra NVL72 chips, which will have one-and-a-half times more memory and two times more bandwidth, will be used to accelerate building AI agents, physical AI, and reasoning models, Huang said during his keynote address. Blackwell Ultra will be available in the second half of this year. The chipmaker’s next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs will be released in the second half of next year, Huang said, followed by Rubin Ultra in the second half of 2027. Rubin Ultra will be four GPUs connected together on a single chip. The next AI chip architecture will be named Feynman, Huang said, and is slated for 2028. “The rate of innovation on all fronts continues to impress and suggests a growing moat versus peers,” Jefferies (JEF-0.23%) analysts said in a note on Wednesday. “However, the updated roadmap does suggest Rubin will only be an incremental update in 2026 with Rubin Ultra the more meaningful leap ahead in 2027.” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, shared similar sentiments in a Wednesday note saying that the Rubin launch “promises another big jump over Blackwell, but smaller than the jump Blackwell made over Hopper.” However, Windsor said the chipmaker “is showing no sign of slowing down meaning that it is quickly expanding into any area where AI will be relevant with the strategy to become the industry standard” before its competitors can start to catch up. While this will help Nvidia keep its market dominance, having more than 85% of market share for data center chips will keep it “a hostage to end demand,” leading to some “tough quarters when the inevitable correction comes,” Windsor said. He added that there are no signs of this yet, as AI-focused companies plan to continue spending tens of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure this year. Bank of America (BAC+0.89%) analysts maintained their “buy” rating for Nvidia, and said they are looking forward to Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra, which show “unmatched roadmap as Rubin advances AI performance 900x (scale-up FLOPs) over Hopper (Blackwell is 68x) in TCO optimized way,” in a note on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives said in a post-conference note on Tuesday that demand for Nvidia’s GPUs “remains extremely robust” and “is currently outstripping supply 15:1” as enterprises wait to receive their AI chips. “In essence, Nvidia’s chips remain the new oil or gold in this world for the tech ecosystem as there is only one chip in the world fueling this AI foundation ... and it’s Nvidia,” Wedbush said.

Title: Boeing stock soars as executive plays up progress — and downplays Trump tariffs

Boeing’s (BA+0.14%) stock jumped more than 6% after CFO Brian West gave upbeat remarks at the Bank of America (BAC+0.89%) Global Industrials Conference, saying the planemaker is on track with its key success factors for the year, according to a Bloomberg News report. West highlighted progress on manufacturing, citing “fantastic” performance in its push to complete 38 aircraft per month and the stabilization of 787 output at five per month. He didn’t anticipate a material near-term impact from tariffs, but admitted to concerns about parts availability. Wednesday’s increase means the company’s shares are trading roughly unchanged so far this year despite unresolved concerns about the effects of President Donald Trump’s imposed and planned tariffs. The company has many suppliers outside the U.S. and must keep prices contained to be able to effectively compete against Airbus (AIR-1.26%) in the commercial plane market. CEO Kelly Ortberg told staff earlier this month that Trump’s tariffs would boost costs on parts like landing gear that are imported from Canada, Bloomberg News reported. Boeing has a Winnipeg-based division that makes more than 500 parts and assemblies for its commercial unit, and is a “tier 1" partner on the 787 Dreamliner, which is assembled in South Carolina. Boeing is also one of the top 10 manufacturers in Mexico and spends up to $1 billion in the nation through its supply chain, according to a company fact sheet. It spends more than $500 million in Mexico each year on commercial airplane parts. Tariffs could create a “continuity of supply issue,” Ortberg said. Boeing’s aircraft are made up of thousands of parts subject to demanding specifications, so suppliers aren’t easily replaced. Aerospace expert Jerrold Lundquist recently noted that a Boeing 737 has about 2,000 parts sourced from 700 suppliers. The CEO of the world’s largest aircraft leasing company, AerCap (AER-0.11%), said earlier that under the worst-case trade war scenario, the price of a 787 could increase by $40 million. “No one’s going to want to pay that,” Angus Kelley told told CNBC’s Squawk Box on March 12. —William Gavin contributed to this article.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: China Market Update: Tencent’s Terrific Q4 AI-Nnounced!

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern , Senior Contributor. CLN Tencent reported Q4 financial results after the Hong Kong close that beat analyst expectations. The solid quarter was driven by “AI-powered enhancements to our advertising platform, higher engagement in Video Accounts, and growth in our evergreen games,” according to Founder, Chairman, and CEO Ma “Pony” Huateng. The company emphasized AI in their press release with Ma’s quote “we have reorganised our AI teams to sharpen focus on both fast product innovation and deep model research, increased our AI-related capital expenditures, and increased our R&D and marketing efforts for our AI-native products”. The presentation dedicated an entire section to AI, noting the company spent $10.7 billion on AI in 2024, which has a capex of 12% of revenue, up from 2023’s $3.4 billion when capex accounted for 4% of revenue. The press conference and analyst Q&A were dominated by AI talk as well. In a good sign for the company and China’s economy, the company noted, “Advertising spending rose across most major categories during the quarter.” Advertisers don’t spend ad dollars if no one is buying! Hat tip to management for the shareholder-friendly buyback and dividend policies! Here are some highlights: Asian equities were mixed overnight on light volumes as Indonesia and Thailand outperformed, and investors waited for Wednesday’s U.S. Federal Reserve announcement. Hong Kong and Mainland China bounced around the room as value stocks outperformed growth stocks in both markets. Utilities were the best-performing sector in both Hong Kong and Mainland China, up +0.92% and +1.26%, respectively, after the NDRC promoted renewable energy. Some media/press attention to BofA’s China strategist calling for a correction by comparing today’s rally to the 2015 rally. I’ve not read the report, but I am skeptical as I find the comparison ridiculous. The 2015 rally was driven by legal and illegal margin debt. As noted yesterday, U.S. flows into U.S.-listed China equity ETFs is less than $1 billion year-to-date despite significant outperformance versus U.S. stocks. U.S.-listed European-focused ETFs have received $5.8 billion YTD. Going back to mid-January 2024’s China equity bottom, the outperformance versus U.S. stocks is very significant, but there are no flows and no love from U.S. investors The geopolitical headwind and constant negative U.S./Western media headlines would change with a Trump-Xi meeting. Some chatter that this could occur in June, though nothing definitive yet Corrections will occur and are healthy, though I suspect dips will be bought. Wednesday’s Hong Kong dip was bought by Mainland investors with a healthy $1.52 billion of net buying of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect. Alibaba and the Hong Kong Tracker ETF were significant large buys. Hong Kong internet stocks were mixed ahead of Tencent’s Q4 results, with KE Holdings down -10.71% post yesterday’s Q4 results. BYD gained +3.89% in Hong Kong and +3.25% in Mainland China following yesterday’s 5-minute battery recharge release. The Ministry of Transport announced a subsidy for cities to trade in their gas buses for electric vehicle buses, which is in the company’s sweet spot. The Financial Times has an article stating that BYD was told to tap the brakes on building a plant in Mexico due to the Chinese government’s worry the technology might “leak” to U.S. rivals. I have one minor issue with the article. BYD has an EV bus plant in California. Maybe BYD should wait for Trump and Xi to meet and build an EV car plant in the U.S. Interesting that the Hong Kong government CEO criticized CK Hutchison (1 HK), which gained +1.22%, for selling their Panama ports to BlackRock. The company got $19 billion, and the stock ripped higher on the news, indicating they got a good deal. Worth noting that Premier Li signed a State Council decree on “Regulations of the State Council on the Handling of International Intellectual Property Disputes.” The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech diverged +0.12% and -1.05%, respectively, on volume down -4.92% from yesterday which is 167% of the 1-year average. 240 stocks advanced, while 231 declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +12.75% from yesterday, which is 170% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). Quality and large capitalization stocks outperformed value, growth, and small capitalization stocks. The top sectors were utilities, up +0.92%, healthcare, up +0.92%, and materials, up +0.87%, while real estate fell -0.98%, consumer discretionary fell -0.86%, and communication services fell -0.4%. The top sub-sectors were consumer services, national defense, and media, while household appliances, real estate management, and telecommunication services were the worst. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were 3x pre-stimulus levels as Mainland investors bought $1.52 billion of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs led by HK Tracker ETF and Alibaba large net buys, XPeng, Xiaomi, and Dobot small net buys, Tencent and SMIC small/moderate net sells, and Meituan a large/moderate net sell. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board fell -0.10%, -0.40%, and -1.18% on volume -3.53% from yesterday, which is 123% of the 1-year average. 1,448 stocks advanced, while 3,531 declined. Value and large capitalization stocks outperformed growth and small capitalization stocks. The top sectors were utilities, up +1.26%, financials, up +0.61%, and industrials, up +0.48%, while communication services fell -3.77%, technology fell -1.93%, and real estate fell -0.83%. The top sub-sectors were precious metals, banking, and power, while telecommunication services, communication equipment, and electronic components were the worst. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were above average. CNY and the Asia dollar index barely fell versus the U.S. dollar. Treasury bond prices gained. Copper rose, and steel fell.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day.

Most Widely Read Newspaper Kindly share this story: The crypto industry moves fast, and often, unanticipated tokens are the biggest winners. In 2021, Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) helped meager investors amass fortunes. Analysts predict a fresh wave of highly valuable currencies from Rexas Finance (RXS), Pi Network (PI), and Mantra (OM). With proper timing, $2,500 in these coins might become $95,000 or more. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Next 100x Crypto in RWA Tokenization Boom Rexas Finance (RXS) is revolutionizing asset investment so anyone may invest in tokenized real-world assets. Historically, only institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals could access these assets. However, Rexas Finance democratizes access by allowing low-cost, borderless trading of tokenized valuable assets like real estate, commodities, collectibles, etc. Despite being in its early stages, Wall Street heavyweights like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs have already embraced RWA tokenization. By 2030, experts project market growth of $30 trillion. With a strong ecosystem, Rexas Finance is tipped to outperform most trending crypto projects in the niche. It offers advanced tokenization, DeFi, and AI-driven features like the Rexas Token Builder, which helps non-coders build blockchain tokens. Businesses, developers, and institutions seeking to tokenize assets or start new projects will find this innovative. Rexas DeFi is a decentralized financial ecosystem that offers yield farming, staking, and liquidity pools. Projects like Rexas Finance, which use RWA tokenization and DeFi to provide investors with passive income and foster a growing financial sector, will lead this transformation. By automating NFT and other digital art generation using AI, Rexas GenAI offers an additional advantage. As AI and blockchain become disruptive technologies, Rexas Finance combines them for exponential acceptance and growth. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance prioritizes security, and their latest Certik audit bolsters investor confidence. This certification attests to the robustness of the platform’s security. The Rexas AI shield automates smart contract auditing and prevents illicit attacks, ensuring safe user assets. The ongoing $1 million giveaway is another opportunity for the top 20 participants to win $50,000 in RXS. Crypto incentives like this help boost token demand and adoption through viral marketing. This campaign and Rexas Finance’s powerful presale are setting up a stunning debut on major exchanges. As of this writing, RXS is in its final presale stage (Stage 12), with 90% of tokens sold. The price has risen from $0.03 in Stage 1 to $0.20, representing a 567% increase before trading began. The project has raised $46.9 million, selling 454 million tokens, making it one of the year’s most successful presales. Meanwhile, RXS investors eagerly await its official debut on June 19, 2025. At least three of the top ten worldwide exchanges are expected to list RXS, predicting a surge following its debut. Analysts anticipate a 38x price increase due to significant liquidity and investor demand. If these forecasts are correct, $2,500 spent today may grow to $98,000 in only a few months. Pi Network (PI): A 293% Rally with More Growth Potential Pi Network (PI) surged 293% in six days, bucking the gloomy market. This extraordinary rise drove PI’s price to $2.62 as of writing, and its market value climbed to $15.91 billion. The token trading volume has increased by 170% to $1.66 billion, indicating investor enthusiasm. Pi’s introduction of its Open Network, which connects external platforms to Pi’s blockchain, has fueled this trend. The anticipation surrounding Binance’s community vote to list PI Coin has fueled a positive mood. Over 86% of voters supported the listing. If approved, PI might experience an enormous price increase, with some analysts anticipating a rise to $10 soon, making it one to watch in the coming months. Mantra (OM): Breaking Records with a 159% Price Surge Mantra (OM) is another exceptional performer. It rose from $3.50 to an all-time high of $9.11, representing a 159% rise. Despite a recent retracement to $7.48, OM is in a solid uptrend and aims to break over the critical $10 mark. The token’s on-chain volume has increased from $128.3 million to a 30-day high of $991.7 million, indicating significant network activity. Currently, 91.44% of the OM supply is profitable, reflecting great holder trust. Integrating real-world assets and decentralized finance has benefited Mantra. The Mantra RWA Accelerator Program, created in collaboration with Google Cloud, is increasing institutional acceptance, reinforcing OM’s optimistic view. Experts forecast a potential OM rally to $15 soon, making it a top buy for massive upside in 2025.

Title: Griffin Gaming Partners’ Peter Levin Talks AI, Market Trends, Emerging Markets & Hollywood Interest Amid GDC

Venture-capital firm manages $1.5 billion in assets focusing on the video games space By Kaare Eriksen Media Analyst The push to utilize generative AI across entertainment isn’t sparing the ever-complex video games industry by any means. With the Game Developers Conference underway this week, Griffin Gaming Partners managing director and co-founder Peter Levin joined Variety Intelligence Platform president Andrew Wallenstein and media analyst Kaare Eriksen on Variety’s “Strictly Business” podcast and wasted no breath expressing the urgency with which AI tech is top of mind for the business and development sides of gaming alike. “I think we’re gonna continue to see a bunch of conversations around AI, its impact on games development, its impact on the picks-and-shovels businesses in and around games development,” said Levin. Related Stories VIP+ AI Training – Consent & Content: A Special Report Netflix's One-Take Drama 'Adolescence' Is a Gutting Account of Murder, Misogyny and Teen Fragility: TV Review Extensive layoffs throughout the global gaming industry are ongoing for more than a year now as major publishers and gaming divisions within larger entertainment companies have gotten aggressive with cost-cutting measures. Concern over AI is mounting among game developers hoping for job prospects to lighten and for stability to come, but Levin sees the embrace of AI as integral to gaming’s future. Popular on Variety Listen to the full podcast: “It’s an optimal time to be a developer or publisher and bake in the AI functionality within your product roadmap,” said Levin. “If they’re not crazy about it, that’s going to happen with or without their sentiment.” “I say this gently and lightly and [am] certainly not celebrating the eradication of anyone’s jobs,” Levin added. “But gaming, traditionally, has been much more akin to enterprise software with respect to recognizing when they need to trim the fat.” AI tech has long been part of the development process and gaming experience across traditional titles, whether for programming enemy NPCs or aiding in procedural generation of player environments, but newer interest in AI in the gaming space has lately revolved around generating content entirely from scratch, utilizing existing assets for UGC purposes and plotting more efficient release strategies. “Some of the ways we’re very excited about the practical application of AI are manifesting in things like customer acquisition, the ability to lever which social media platforms, for example, are the best environments within which to market to a certain customer,” said Levin. Despite the industry’s headwinds, the oncoming launches of Nintendo Switch 2 and “Grand Theft Auto 6” in 2025 have Levin excited, as do emerging markets for games outside of North America and Europe, where smartphone proliferation continues to power the mobile games sector. “You’ve got the telco players, whether that’s the Mittals [Bharti Airtel] or the MTNs or the Vodafones,” said Levin. “They’re looking at what some of the other carriers have done in markets like North America, where they’ve left a lot of money on the table… These carriers really don’t participate in these markets, in the economics, you’ve got Google gobbling up and you’ve got, obviously, Apple and iOS gobbling up their share.” “At some point, these [U.S.] carriers become self-commoditizing big fat pipes, and that’s a mistake that I think in a lot of emerging markets they would like to fix,” Levin said. “So they’re going to invest directly into content. They want more skin in the game. They want a more intimate relationship with that consuming demographic.” Levin continued: “You see a lot of expats in emerging markets, and I think that’s one way to address the opportunity. But at some point you have to have local talent. It’s less expensive. They understand not just the localization of content, but the culturalization of content, which is a much harder needle to thread.” As for Hollywood’s involvement in gaming, Levin praised Remedy Entertainment’s deal with Annapurna Pictures to fund development for “Control 2” in exchange for exclusive film and TV rights to “Control” and “Alan Wake” as a “great example of thinking outside of the box.” Levin is also excited for the prospects of games at Skydance, should its deal to acquire Paramount Global go through. “Hopefully when David Ellison and [Skydance] close on Paramount… I think they’re gonna have a much different orientation towards gaming,” said Levin. “They’re gonna have a longer runway to play with.” “Strictly Business” is Variety’s weekly podcast featuring conversations with industry leaders about the business of media and entertainment.

Title: Pressure is ramping up in Big Tech. Employees told BI how they feel about it.

Good morning. New documents filed by the Justice Department shed light on how far the White House has gone in trying to cut probationary staff from the federal government. It's the largest insight yet into the mass firings. Oh, and if you're missing your usual anchor Dan DeFrancesco, he's got a funny story for you from parental leave. In today's big story, tech companies are sending a message to employees: The days of perks and pampering are over. What's on deck First, the tables have turned. Do more with less. That's the new mantra in Silicon Valley. Gone are the days of the in-office massage, the free laundry services, and the fancy food. Layoffs and budget cuts have become pervasive in response to a trifecta of issues: economics, post-pandemic realities, and political pressure. But CEOs aren't just ending the office pampering — they want everyone to know it. Between performance-based cuts, return-to-office mandates, and the stripping of workplace perks, the message is clear: Tech is going hardcore. Here are just several examples of how tech companies have changed their tune: Big Tech leaders haven't been shy about adopting hard-driving strategies. But what do their employees think? BI reporters interviewed staff at tech giants including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta — as well as various startups — about the changes. "There is more pressure for individuals to be better in their roles, and there is much more aggressive performance management happening these days," a current Google manager told BI. A recruiting firm cofounder said he's heard multiple leaders tell their employees the same thing: "If you're not all in, no hard feelings, we can give severance, but we can't slow down." Tech employees had it sweet. Now, they have to sweat. 1. Tesla's stock slide just sped up. Shares are on pace to fall for a 9th straight week, and the slide accelerated on Tuesday thanks to a hailstorm of issues involving its CEO, competition, and expectations on Wall Street. However, Tesla's employees — many of whom receive large stock grants as part of their compensation packages — aren't worried. 2. Stagflation is the market's big bogeyman. Investors dumped a record amount of US stock last week. Growing stagflation fears were key, a Bank of America survey found, with 71% of fund managers saying they expected it to hit the global economy in the next 12 months. 3. Predicting where stocks could go next. It's a bad idea to use news headlines when trying to guess where the markets will go. Technical analyst Helene Meisler told BI the five charts she's using instead to gauge market sentiment, and what she sees in its future. 1. A big acquisition with bigger implications. Google's parent company Alphabet has acquired the cybersecurity firm Wiz for a whopping $32 billion. The deal rewards early Wiz investors, but other startups could stand to benefit if it catalyzes an M&A cycle. It'll also test the regulatory environment under Trump. 2. Elon Musk has gone MIA as CEO. He's not the only one. Musk's reign at DOGE has Tesla investors wanting their CEO back — but he's not the first chief executive to go AWOL. Company morale and productivity are paying the price. 3. Everything Jensen Huang revealed at the Nvidia conference. The CEO shared the company's road map for the next few years, including updates on the next generation of chips. He also introduced Blue, a "Star Wars"-like robot, to show off a partnership with Google and Disney. 1. One year after the real-estate revolution. A landmark settlement upended traditional industry practice by changing the way real estate agents are paid. Now, some Americans are saving big on homebuying. 2. The vibecession is back. The US isn't in a recession, but Americans feel like they're in one. That's thanks to recent market volatility, Trump's shifting tariff policies, and more. Even if the economy isn't doing as badly as Americans imagine, a vibecession still has serious consequences. 3. Inside JPMorgan's RTO plans for its largest office. Employees at JPMorgan's Polaris campus are heading back to the office next month. The bank is promising amenities like upgraded dining and shuttle services, according to a memo exclusively seen by BI, but not everyone is thrilled. Jensen Huang delivers keynote speech at Nvidia GTC AI conference. The Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Rhoda Wilson | Mar 19, 2025 | Conspiracy Fact and Theory, Coincidence, Health | 5 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Exposé. Now that the COVID narrative is collapsing, a new mass formation is emerging around the story of the war in Ukraine, Professor Mattias Desmet Professor Mattias Desmet says. Emotions such as fear, frustration, and aggression are being redirected towards this new narrative. In 2020, Desmet, a professor of clinical psychology, publicized his theory that, regarding the COVID narrative, what was happening in society was a worldwide process of mass formation. This new mass formation about Ukraine has the potential to be more intense and aggressive than the COVID one, Prof. Desmet warns. He believes the way of words rather than the way of war should be pursued to truly help Ukraine. From Corona to Ukraine – The New Mass Formation Dear friends, followers, and critics, We are at a pivotal moment. On one hand, we are witnessing the collapse of the corona narrative; on the other, we are seeing a new mass formation arising around the story of the war in Ukraine. These two phenomena are not occurring by chance at the same time. Table of Contents What everyone who wanted to know had already long known is now slowly seeping through to newspapers and news programs: we can stop blaming the bats from Wuhan. The coronavirus came from a lab in Wuhan, where, indeed, they were experimenting with coronaviruses. What is now emerging in the corporate media is even worse than just the fact that the virus came from a laboratory. It is also becoming clear that (some of) those who promoted the measures always knew it came from a laboratory. People like Nobel laureate Luc Montagnier warned from the start of the crisis that certain sequences in the virus’ DNA do not occur in nature and that the virus was a so-called “gain-of-function” creation. He was dismissed by the media and by government-paid “research journalists” and “fact-checkers” as a charlatan and conspiracy theorist. He was simply right. It shows something of the ruthlessness with which the truth was suppressed during the crisis. Be sure to also listen to Mark Zuckerberg’s public confession with Joe Rogan. He explains there exactly why he wants to stop the fact-checking on Meta. The fact-checkers are primarily propaganda tools. They mainly serve to divert attention from the truth. Does the origin of the virus ultimately matter? Yes, it does. It further demonstrates the dramatic failure of the entire technocratic and rationalistic approach to life and living together. Not only did the technological remedy for the disease fail (for example, the mRNA vaccines did not stop the spread of the virus), but this approach now also turns out to be responsible for the disease itself (i.e., it produced the virus). Now that we agree the virus came from the Wuhan laboratory, the next question arises: what did virologist Anthony Fauci have to do with that lab? For those who want to know a bit more, click on THIS link to a document from the US Congress. Or read the last two books of that damned new health minister in the USA, the anti-vaxxer and conspiracy theorist Kennedy. Perhaps his mouth, like that of Professor Montagnier, generally speaks the truth on this matter as well? And the media may slowly warm up to answering the following questions. First question: What about the mortality rate of that gain-of-function virus? Why did the world go along for so long with mortality statistics that even the authors of them had stated in a hearing for “The House of Commons” in 2020 were much too high? Second question: Did the vaccines stop the spread of the virus? The assumption that this was the case led to the group of people who refused the vaccine being treated as second-class citizens. They were banned from restaurants, theatres, airplanes, and a few other things. They were pointed at by politicians worldwide as those who caused the pandemic. “The pandemic of the unvaccinated” – you remember that if you were part of that group. Who still doubts that this whole dehumanizing policy was anything but based on facts? The vaccine did not stop the spread of the virus. As for the question of how safe it was, we will wait a bit. We’ll be ready for that once the previous two questions are answered. Despite the obvious failure of the corona policy, the proponents are preparing to apply the same strategy for the next virus outbreak (I wonder if it will come from a laboratory again). The WHO, for example, has already bought the corona-surveillance technology (the system with the QR codes and so on) from the EU to further develop it into a digital vaccination passport. It is to become part of a broader digital identity and a linked social-credit system and a digital currency (the so-called Central Bank Digital Coins). To the extent that one is seduced in life by the idea of order and control, it is indeed a very attractive idea: to neatly reorganize the entire wriggling heap of society digitally and reduce the human ecological footprint by rewarding and punishing “good” and “bad” behavior. Children have to be raised, don’t they? And aren’t we all little, irresponsible children? In a way, yes. The question is: which little child is going to raise the other little children? Like any totalitarian system, the current technocratic system learns nothing from the disasters it causes. It sails blindly and fanatically on the ideological wind toward the rocks of its next failure. It sacrifices the next generation of its victims in anticipation of a technological paradise that will always remain a utopia on the horizon. Totalitarian systems always live on credit. Later, when the system is running perfectly, they will compensate for the disasters they are currently causing. And that’s why they will continue to cause disasters for the time being. I could go into many other aspects of the corona crisis, but I will leave it here for now. I prefer to ask myself the question: why is the corona story collapsing now? Perhaps because insight progresses slowly and we are only now beginning to see what happened during those strange years? I don’t think so. The appearance of the truth in the corporate media has little or nothing to do with the progress of insight. Even a small child could see from the beginning that the story was falling apart in every direction. There were, therefore, other reasons for being blind to it than the insight not being far enough advanced. The corona story is collapsing now because all the emotions that had found refuge in it – fear, frustration, aggression, the drive toward self-destruction of the completely isolated person – have slowly found a new refuge: the story of the war in Ukraine and the prospect of a new world war. All the fear, frustration, and aggression that had been linked to the coronavirus and “the anti-vaxxers” are now linked to a new object: “Putin” and “the Russians.” The great vital forces – the true Masters of man – have found a new story to take refuge in. The corona house remains abandoned, shrinking like a house left behind by its inhabitants, to the point that even a small push from a small mind is enough to make it collapse. If the current series of crises teaches us anything about humanity, it is this: man is not primarily a rational being; he is a being governed by vital and metaphysical forces to which his reason is radically subordinated. The new mass formation has the potential to be more intense and aggressive than the previous one. The reason, I have explained many times: the previous mass formation only increased loneliness and the fear and aggression linked to it. Mass formations seem to take away loneliness. Hence the bewildering enthusiasm we witnessed in, for example, videos of dancing nurses and doctors. That enthusiasm is based on an illusion. In reality, the mass only makes loneliness and all the dark feelings attached to it greater. In the mass, solidarity, and connection with fellow human beings are strictly forbidden. The only solidarity allowed is solidarity with the collective. And to that, every form of solidarity and connection with another person is radically subordinated. The dramatic endpoint of this is the mother who reports her child to the state and proudly receives a medal on the scaffold for her unwavering loyalty to the collective. In Europe, the call for war is growing louder. Now that the great monster Trump no longer wants to protect Europe, the urgent need arises to mobilize a proper army and weapon system, it is said. President Ursula von der Leyen goes so far as to say that she wants to use the savings of the population – a sloppy 800 billion – to make the war industry run at full speed. Let me be clear: I have no need to tell a pro-Putin story. My opinion is neither pro nor con. My opinion is that the way of words, rather than the way of war, should be pursued. It is certainly not a matter of convincing you not to help Ukraine; it is a matter of thinking together with you about how we can truly help Ukraine. And that will not be by plunging the world into a third world war. That Putin is no saint, no one needs to convince me of that. I have written a long article on Russia under Putin. Putin rose from street boy to director of the FSB, the successor of the infamous Soviet KGB. Anyone who has any knowledge of the workings and nature of that secret service knows that its director will not exactly be a sentimental soft-boiled egg. Putin keeps a great power afloat. And he does that like leaders of great powers do. For example, the Moscow regime uses false flag operations in which hundreds of its own citizens die to create support for war in breakaway republics like Chechnya, and it eliminates journalists who speak uncomfortable truths. That being said, the way the war story is now portrayed in the media bears the same absurd characteristics as the corona story did at the time. Russia is, in some respects, an expansionist nation. But its expansionism is a small beer compared to that of NATO and the USA. Here is my modest opinion: Russia knows that in the great expansionist struggle, it might lose, and if it comes to war, it is largely because it feels that it has a knife to its throat. In this article from ten years ago – written in tempore non suspecto – you can read that the geopolitical manoeuvres of NATO in the Black Sea region would inevitably lead to war with Russia. Those manoeuvres were merely the point of the spear directed at Russia in a much larger expansionist USA project. Since WWII, the USA has, by most estimates, built between 700 and 800 military bases abroad. To those who are so convinced that Russia is the only aggressor in the Ukraine story: try looking through the eyes of the Kremlin. How would Europe or America feel if, under the cover of many beautiful stories about “democracy,” Russia marched toward Brussels or Washington with hundreds of military bases? Or also look at the history of the regime change operations of the USA since WWII. Anyone who takes the trouble to learn about recent history will see how South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe were gradually politically and militarily subjected by the USA and/or NATO. I have previously written an article on the historical context of the war in Ukraine. I will not go into it in detail here. You can find the article via THIS link. In short, it is not true that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was “unprovoked.” Since the American-initiated regime change of 2014 in Maidan Square, there have been roughly three reasons that drove Russia to start the war. First, the Russians had humanitarian reasons. After 2014, the Kiev regime oppressed the ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine (especially the Donbas region). This was not exactly done gently. Kiev even used cluster bombs in densely populated neighborhoods, which led to hundreds of thousands of refugees seeking safety in Russia. I don’t know if Putin invaded Ukraine out of humanitarian concern. It is quite possible that he didn’t want to let his authority as a leader be undermined by allowing the regime in Kiev to commit atrocities against Russian-speaking Ukrainians. But this is enough to make clear that we cannot simply speak in black-and-white terms about “the bad Russians” and “the good Ukrainians.” That much I know. Second, there were economic reasons. Since 2014, Ukraine’s vast natural resource reserves (especially minerals) were at risk of falling into American hands. The pro-American regimes that came to power in Ukraine after 2014 lifted the law that stated that foreigners could only buy up to two hectares of land in Ukraine. In no time, American companies like Cargill, Monsanto, and Du Pont bought up a third of Ukrainian land, and investment giants like Blackrock signed contracts for the supply of weapons for the war (which they knew was inevitable) and for the reconstruction of the country after that war. Or how one can make a lot of money in a short time by throwing all ethical considerations overboard. Additionally, there are important strategic reasons involved in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Think mainly of the importance of ensuring access to the Black Sea region for Russia. If Russia does not have access to the Black Sea, it will cease to exist as a great power in the near future. NATO knows this well because they are using the militarization of Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region to apply the strategy Lord Palmerston used in the 19th century, which led to the first Crimean War. This strategy was revived at the end of the 20th century by Brzezinski in his book ‘The Grand Chessboard.’ It is well-known that the so-called neocons, who in many ways pull the strings in the USA and NATO, adopted Brzezinski’s strategy as their own. I believe that any sober analysis of the situation will conclude that Putin and Russia had a choice: either they invaded Ukraine, or it was over for Russia as a great power. Moreover, Putin already made it clear at the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest that Ukraine was the red line: if NATO made moves to annex Ukraine after the rest of Eastern Europe, war was the only outcome. He probably didn’t need to explain it to them; they knew it better than him. Any analysis of the historical data shows that the European and American leaders at that time realized that their maneuvers in Ukraine were almost inevitably heading toward a third world war. So, we are witnessing a struggle between great powers. One is more expansionist than the other, and one is more successful in the dirty military game than the other. Like all great powers, they feel threatened in their dominance. Great powers are subject to the law of the Ego: the more power one has, the more fearful and aggressive one becomes. Like all great powers, they use all the harmful strategic and military techniques of our rationalist time. Both thrive on propaganda, including false flag operations where, if necessary, their own citizens are sacrificed to influence public opinion. And both do not shy away from political persecution and murder. The population should not so much choose between one of these two great powers; they must make it clear that a large-scale military and nuclear conflict is not an option, and that at least the way of words must be fully explored first. Putin is a human being, the Russians are human beings. And a human being wants to be heard. There are enough reasons to listen carefully to what the Russians have to say. I do not want to say with this article that Ukraine should be left to its fate. Certainly not. What I do want to say is that the lead-up to a conflict and the intentions behind it must be assessed and portrayed as accurately as possible. And that we should certainly be cautious about fuelling a war that, with diplomacy and a little bit of introspection, might be stopped. That is the only way we can truly offer the suffering men, women, and children of Ukraine the prospect of ending this senseless violence. It is an illusion to think that a looming nuclear inferno, which threatens to wipe out all life on this planet, will wake the masses up from their mass formation. The mass is an organism that thrives on death drive. Its ultimate goal is self-destruction. The person who slides into mass formation has already chosen death, the death of all others, and their own death. The only thing that can stop this tendency is the courage to speak the truth to those who feel that something is wrong with the war story. A mass formation always develops under a growing veil of illusion, a one-sided and misleading danger that attributes all the misfortune in the world to one object. It is that illusion that must be broken with words, words that are spoken from the realization of the limitation of all knowledge, from the realization that the truth cannot and should not be fully said, from the realization that the one who thinks and is different is ultimately also a human being, from the realization that the Other is only our enemy in illusion. Mattias Mattias Desmet is recognized as the world’s leading expert on the theory of mass formation as it applies to the COVID-19 pandemic. He is a professor of clinical psychology in the Department of Psychology and Educational Sciences at Ghent University, Belgium, and a practicing psychoanalytic psychotherapist. He is well-known in academic circles for his research on fraud within academia. He is the author of over one hundred peer-reviewed academic papers and is the author of the books ‘The Psychology of Totalitarianism’, ‘The Pursuit of Objectivity in Psychology’ and ‘Lacan’s Logic of Subjectivity: A Walk on the Graph of Desire’.

Title: ‘The Floodgates Open’—Bitcoin And Crypto Brace For A $9 Trillion Fed Price Flip

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. 03/19 update below. This post was originally published on March 18 Bitcoin has been stuck in holding pattern in recent weeks, struggling to regain momentum after “panic selling” raised fears of a major bitcoin price crash. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has dropped from its all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, plummeting to around $80,000 despite a leak revealing Russia is quietly leaning into bitcoin and crypto. Now, as traders speculate Donald Trump’s White House could be gearing up to buy as much bitcoin as possible, closely-watched crypto trader Arthur Hayes has predicted the Federal Reserve is about to step in to stabilize markets, potentially triggering a bitcoin price boom. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell could step in to support markets, including the bitcoin price ... [+] and cryptocurrencies, according to BitMex cofounder Arthur Hayes. “When there’s financial distress, they always print money. It doesn’t matter the political leanings,” Hayes, the cofounder of crypto deivatives pioneer BitMex who went onto launch the Maelstrom investment company, said in a wide-ranging interview with Bitcoin News. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has followed stock markets lower in recent weeks as traders react to U.S. president Donald Trump’s on again-off again international trade tariffs and the rising risk of recession. 03/19 update: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is "between a rock and a hard place," Wells Fargo’s chief economist has told the Wall Street Journal, with the Fed likely to hold rates steady today as it grapples with the prospect of Donald Trump’s trade war fueling an inflation bump but also dampening economic growth. Traders are whispering that Powell could announce an end to the Fed’s balance sheet runoff program, known as quantitative tightening, which could boost the bitcoin price, crypto and stock markets. “Our rates strategists expect the statement to indicate that the Fed is pausing quantitative tightening until the debt ceiling is resolved, as suggested in the January meeting minutes,” Bank of America analysts wrote in a note seen by Coindesk. “They do not expect to restart after the debt ceiling is addressed, but the announcement won’t be made until later this year.” The Fed will announce its interest rate decision at 2pm ET, followed by Powell’s 2:30pm ET press conference. "Late last year, Fed chair Powell hinted that the end of [quantitative tightening] was coming in 2025. If he mentions it in [today’s statement or press conference (I imagine someone will ask him), that would end up signalling that we’re in a new monetary regime, and that the Fed stands ready to resume additional debt purchases should [quantitative easing] become necessary again," Noelle Acheson, editor of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, wrote in an emailed note. "While renewed [quantitative easing] is unlikely any time soon, the additional liquidity from a large buyer (the Fed) coming back into the market to replace maturing holdings would be good news," Acheson wrote, adding the Treasury market is facing $9 trillion in debt maturity this year that quantitative tightening could disrupt. "When the floodgates open, it’s go time,” Hayes said, referring to the return of liquidity to the market, and predicting “they’re going to reflate and print more money than anyone’s ever printed before.” The last bitcoin price boom that saw the bitcoin price climb to around $70,000 in late 2021 came in the aftermath of huge Covid-era government stimulus spending and money-printing. “We are experiencing a low in liquidity fiat money generation,” Hayes said. Hayes has predicted the bitcoin price will reach $250,000 by the end of the year as the Fed is forced to flip dovish and move to prop up the economy and asset prices. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped back from its recent highs of around $110,000 per bitcoin, dragging ... [+] down the wider crypto market. “All eyes are on the Federal Reserve policy meeting this week,” BlackRock analysts wrote in a note. The Federal Reserve today begins its two-day policy meeting, with the Fed’s latest interest rate decision due tomorrow—expected to see interest rates left unchanged despite president Trump’s campaign to see them brought down. Traders are pricing in two or three rate cuts later this year but that could change with Fed chair Jerome Powell’s all-important, post-decision press conference.

Title: Forbes Daily: Alphabet’s $32B Wiz Deal Is Its Largest Acquisition Yet

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob , Forbes Staff andForbes Daily , Forbes Staff. Budget carrier Frontier Airlines is taking a page from its competitor Southwest’s book. Frontier is now selling “economy bundles” that include a free carry-on bag, as well as offering a promotion for an additional, free checked bag for summer travel—that perk goes into effect the same day Southwest plans to end its popular two free checked bags policy. And “if travelers show us the love,” CEO Barry Biffle said the airline could make the perks permanent. Still, it’s unclear if that will happen, since roughly $650 million—or around 17%—of Frontier’s total revenue in 2024 came from baggage fees. Win McNamee/Getty Images U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare rebuke of President Donald Trump on Tuesday, saying that Trump’s call to impeach a federal judge is inappropriate. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that Trump’s executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 should be paused for 14 days, and is now looking into whether the Trump Administration defied the order by sending more than 260 migrants to a prison in El Salvador. Google parent company Alphabet is making its largest acquisition ever with a $32 billion all-cash deal to buy Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz, which will make its four cofounders worth about $2.2 billion apiece. Forbes profiled the company in 2023, highlighting its aggressive growth strategy that at the time raised eyebrows from some industry peers. San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images In the latest sign of the apparent corporate retreat from DEI, organizers behind one of the country’s largest LGBTQ Pride celebrations say an abnormal number of companies have pulled out of sponsoring this year’s march. San Francisco Pride organizers confirmed to Forbes four companies that dropped out of supporting its celebrations this year, and according to SFGate, the loss of sponsorships represents $300,000 in funding—slightly less than a tenth of the $3.2 million budgeted for SF Pride’s June events. Distributed Spectrum cofounders Ben Harpe, Isaac Struhl and Alex Wuff. Distributed Spectrum, a company founded by Harvard students, is making tiny AI-powered sensors to help the U.S. military locate enemy troops and drones via radio emissions. On Tuesday, the company announced it has raised $25 million in a Series A funding round. The need for such devices is perhaps most apparent in Ukraine, where radio waves are powering everything from warfare communication to guided missiles and explosive-laden drones. A judge ruled that Elon Musk’s and DOGE’s efforts to dismantle USAID are likely unconstitutional, and ordered the Trump Administration to restore the foreign aid agency’s functionality. The administration has sought to distance Musk from the widespread federal cuts, and the case is one of several that take aim at the billionaire’s authority over the federal government. The Trump Organization previously tried and failed to expand into Ukraine, long before Trump’s first presidency and the war with Russia, according to testimony Donald Trump gave in 2007. Trump was interested in developing a hotel in Kiev sometime prior to March 2005 as part of broader expansion plans, he explained during a sworn deposition in a lawsuit he filed against journalist Timothy O’Brien and his publisher. Purdue Pharma submitted a new bankruptcy plan Tuesday, which will give its creditors more than $7.4 billion in cash—including up to $7 billion in payments from the billionaire Sackler family—to help compensate the victims of the opioid crisis, after the Supreme Court struck down the company’s previous settlement plan. Under the plan, the drugmaker would be dissolved and a new “public benefit company” would absorb its assets. Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to a limited ceasefire Tuesday that involves temporarily not attacking Ukrainian energy and infrastructure targets, after a highly anticipated phone call with President Donald Trump, but stopped short of agreeing to a full ceasefire. It’s unclear whether the leaders discussed land and power plants seized in the war, a major factor in permanently ending the conflict, though Trump said Sunday he would discuss “dividing up certain assets.” Tax Day is just around the corner, but it’s been a slow start to the tax season, and the millions of taxpayers who still need to file could consider filing for an extension if they’re not ready. It’s most important to ensure your return is accurate, and the extension will be granted automatically as long as you follow the rules. The National Archives on Tuesday released a massive tranche of documents pertaining to the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, after President Donald Trump vowed “all” records surrounding the JFK assassination would be publicly released. Researchers previously estimated between 3,000 and 4,000 documents have not been released, but experts have said it’s unlikely the remaining records would contain any smoking gun that changes the government’s findings. Gianluigia Aponte President Donald Trump has touted a deal for a “large American company” to buy two ports on the Panama Canal. The deal to which he was referring was the sale of 43 ports owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing’s Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison to a group led by asset manager BlackRock for $23 billion—and the two Panama ports were just a small part of it. What Trump didn’t say: One of the two partners in the deal, Terminal Investment Limited, is an arm of Swiss shipping giant Mediterranean Shipping Company, commonly known as MSC, cofounded by Swiss-Italian billionaires Gianluigi and Rafaela Aponte in 1970. While the ownership structure of the sale hasn’t been made public, the deal will turn MSC into the largest port operator in the world. MSC owns 70% of Terminal Investment, while investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners—led by U.S. billionaire Adebayo “Bayo” Ogunlesi and now owned by BlackRock, which bought it for $12.5 billion in October—holds 20%, and the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC owns the remaining 10%. Even before the CK Hutchison deal, MSC has spent more than $40 billion since January 2022, according to Forbes estimates, investing in everything from new ports to hospitals and even a high-speed rail company in Italy. The bulk of that was new ships: Over the past three years, the firm has bought or ordered 370 vessels for more than $31 billion, according to ship valuation experts VesselsValue. Ownership of MSC is split equally between Aponte and his wife Rafaela Aponte-Diamant. Forbes estimates they are each worth $37.5 billion, enough to make Aponte-Diamant the richest self-made woman in the world. WHY IT MATTERS “The Covid-19 pandemic snarled supply chains and sent freight rates surging, leading to record profits for the world's largest shipping firms,” says Forbes staff writer Giacomo Tognini. “MSC had already overtaken Maersk to become the world’s largest container shipping firm in January 2022, and it has spent the last three years spending that cash to expand its dominance by buying up companies in trucking, air cargo, tugboats, maritime logistics, freight forwarding, car carriers and more.” “That growth helped increase cofounders Gianluigi and Rafaela Aponte’s net worths by a combined $58 billion since early 2022—and if regulators approve the CK Hutchison deal, MSC will become the largest port operator in the world.” MORE Meet The Greek Shipping Billionaires Getting Rich Off Russian Oil Amid the sweeping layoffs across the federal government, the Department of Defense is reportedly preparing to slash tens of thousands of positions. It wasn’t immediately clear when the cuts would be made: Between 50,000 and 60,000: The number of jobs the DoD is planning to eliminate 5% to 8%: The amount Pentagon leadership has previously said it aims to reduce its civilian workforce by, or 45,000 to 72,000 jobs More than 900,000: The number of employees in the DoD’s civilian workforce, per the Associated Press For years, we’ve been sold the idea that a successful career means earning a degree, landing a job and climbing the corporate ladder. But this route often involves compromising personal priorities, and when you tie your professional identity to one path, it can make you vulnerable—as evidenced by recent layoffs. Instead, more people are turning to non-linear careers, which can allow you to structure your professional life around what’s most important to you, grow through diverse experiences and adapt to different contexts.

Stocks advanced on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate announcement at 2 p.m., which will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all rose modestly as of 10:52 a.m. — with the all the Magnificent 7 shares except Meta (META+1.48%) rising. The Fed will probably keep interest rates on hold, with investors focused on board members’ rate expectations — the so-called dot plot — and on the central bank’s revised economic forecasts, observers said. Powell’s comments will also be scrutinized. While the Fed governors are expected to keep the key rate at 4.5%, they may opt to pause — or signal a possible pause in May of — quantitative tightening (QT), the sale of financial assets from its balance sheet, economists said. The U.S. economy is definitely softening, but economists are divided as to the direction of inflation and policy, with some projecting three rate cuts starting as soon as the current meeting — which would be a surprise — and others seeing policymakers staying put for longer as prices remain sticky. Here are some stocks to watch today: Autodesk (ADSK+0.33%) stock gained 3.9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that activist investor Starboard Value plans to start a proxy fight at the design-software company. Boeing’s (BA+0.14%) stock jumped more than 6% after CFO Brian West gave upbeat remarks at the Bank of America Global Industrials Conference, saying the planemaker is on track with its key success factors for the year, according to a Bloomberg News report. General Mills (GIS-1.62%) stock fell 1.6% after the food company’s quarterly revenue fell short of expectations and it cut its sales forecast for the year. Gilead (GILD-1.98%) stock fell 3.8% after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering cutting spending on domestic HIV prevention. GSK’s (GSK-0.16%) U.S.-listed shares fell about 2%. Nvidia (NVDA+0.78%) stock gained 1%. The chipmaker’s AI conference in San Jose continues Wednesday. The keynote address Tuesday by CEO Jensen Huang failed to wow investors amid a tech-stock selldown, despite his announcement that the company will team up with GM (GM-0.18%) to build self-driving cars. Here’s a roundup from the speech. Tencent’s (TCEHY-5.17%) quarterly sales and profit both beat expectations and the Chinese internet giant announced increased investment in AI. The ADRs gained about 0.7%. Tesla (TSLA-0.92%) stock jumped 2.7% after it obtained a permit in California to operate a ride service and Cantor Fitzgerald — the firm formerly run by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — upgraded the shares to a buy. Elon Musk’s EV maker fell 5.3% on Tuesday after BYD (BYDDY-0.39%) unveiled an ultra-fast charger, amid growing signs that Chinese EV makers are motoring ahead. BYD’s ADRs advanced 1.8%, following the Hong Kong-listed shares higher. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Not enough new houses are being built to stop property prices rising continuously. Stock image Property prices were up by 8.1pc in the year to January. They have risen for the 17th month in a row. And prices are likely to keep rising as the Central Bank has cut its projections for house building for the next three years. New figures from the Central Statistics Office (CS) show home values in Dublin rose by 7.5pc. Outside Dublin they were up by 8.6pc compared with the same month last year, according to the CSO’s property price register. The median, or typical, price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to January was €360,000. This is up some €5,000 from the figure for December. The highest median price for a dwelling was €662,349 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €180,000 in Leitrim. Revenue data shows that there were 1,504 first-time buyer purchases in January 2025. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to January was A94 Blackrock with a median price of €743,500. Clones, Co Monaghan, had the least expensive price of €133,000. CSO statistician Niall Corkery said: “Residential property prices rose by 8.1pc in the 12 months to January 2025, down from 8.8pc in the year to December 2024. “In Dublin, residential property prices saw an increase of 7.5pc, while property prices outside Dublin were 8.6pc higher in January 2025 when compared with a year earlier.” In January, 3,801 dwelling purchases by households at market prices were filed with the Revenue Commissioners. This was an increase of 5pc when compared with the 3,621 purchases in January 2024. The total value of transactions filed in January 2025 was €1.6bn. This was made up of 2,824 existing dwellings with a value of €1.2 billion, and 977 new dwellings with a value of €459.0 million. In Dublin, the highest house price growth was in Fingal at 9.5pc, while Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown saw a rise of 6.4pc. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border. Made up of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo, with rises of 12.7pc. The Mid-West (Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary) saw prices rises by 11.9pc. At the other end of the scale, the Mid-East (Kildare, Louth, Meath, and Wicklow) saw a 5.8% rise in house prices The latest property price figures come as the Central Bank has cut its forecast for housing completions in Ireland this year and next. It follows the dramatic drop in residential construction activity at the end of 2024. The bank previously predicted 37,000 homes would be completed in 2025, but it now believes that number will be 35,000. It has also slightly reduced its forecast for next year, to 40,000, but expects there will be some catch-up in delivery, to 44,000, in 2027. The forecasts mean the bank expects government housing targets to be missed for each of the coming three years. In the Programme for Government, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael set a target of building over 300,000 new homes by the end of 2030, scaling up from a 41,000 target this year to 60,000 by the end of the decade. The Government has been more bullish about output of late because of 69,000 commencements last year, which it said meant a “robust stock of new housing in the pipeline”. In its latest quarterly bulletin, the Central Bank says that several factors are restraining housing supply, including low productivity in the construction sector, delays in connecting utilities such as water, planning delays, and a shortage of zoned and serviced land in areas of high demand. A chronic shortage of homes to buy, combined with demographic changes, is keeping demand for housing strong and sending prices up. Demand for homes is also being fuelled by the State’s Help-to-Buy and First Homes schemes. These are giving new buyers more financial firepower at a time when the supply of new homes is not keeping pace with demand.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Nvidia and Elon Musk's xAI have joined a consortium backed by Microsoft and BlackRock to expand artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S., the companies said on Wednesday, as a global race to dominate the nascent technology intensifies. The group, formed last year with a goal to initially invest more than $30 billion in AI-related projects, is one of the biggest efforts to bankroll data centers and energy facilities needed to power AI applications such as ChatGPT. The additions come two months after U.S. President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a private sector AI infrastructure initiative backed by SoftBank Group, OpenAI and Oracle, with plans to mobilize up to $500 billion. Investors have committed $100 billion for immediate deployment, with the rest expected over the next four years. The consortium- which includes Abu Dhabi-backed investment firm MGX and BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners - on Wednesday renamed itself as AI Infrastructure Partnership. Nvidia, a technical advisor, will continue in the role. Training AI models and large-scale data processing require huge computational power, which increases energy consumption. To meet the demands, tech companies are deploying thousands of chips in clusters, driving a surge for specialized data centers. To fund the computing and power needs, the consortium has been looking to raise money from investors, asset owners and corporations, with a goal to mobilize up to $100 billion, including debt financing. "AIP has attracted significant capital and partner interest since its inception in September," the group said, but did not disclose the total funds raised so far. GE Vernova and utility firm NextEra Energy will also be a part of the group, it said, adding the renewable energy company will work on supply-chain planning and high efficiency energy solutions. AIP said its investments will also focus on U.S. partners and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

ByGiacomo Tognini ByGiacomo Tognini , Forbes Staff. During his speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4, President Donald Trump touted a deal that had closed that day for two ports on the Panama Canal. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal,” he said, to applause from the politicians gathered at the Capitol. The deal to which he was referring was the sale of 43 ports owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing’s Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison to a group led by asset manager BlackRock for $23 billion—and the two Panama ports were just a small part of it. What Trump didn’t say: one of the two partners in the deal, Terminal Investment Limited, is an arm of Swiss shipping giant Mediterranean Shipping Company, commonly known as MSC, cofounded by Swiss-Italian billionaires Gianluigi and Rafaela Aponte in 1970. While the ownership structure of the sale hasn’t been made public, the deal will turn MSC into the largest port operator in the world, with stakes in more than 100 terminals in 54 countries, including eight in the U.S. and three in Panama. MSC owns 70% of Terminal Investment, while investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners—led by U.S. billionaire Adebayo “Bayo” Ogunlesi and now owned by BlackRock, which bought it for $12.5 billion in October—holds 20% and the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC owns the remaining 10%. Ogunlesi and the Apontes first teamed up in 2013, when GIP bought a 35% stake in Terminal Investment from MSC for $1.4 billion before selling part of its shares in 2019 and 2021. U.S. billionaire Adebayo Ogunlesi is cofounder of private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners, which first invested in the Apontes' Terminal Investment Ltd. in 2013. Pending approval from European and Panamanian regulators, the deal will see BlackRock and Terminal Investment take over CK Hutchison’s ports outside of China and Hong Kong for a cash payment of $18 billion plus the assumption of $5 billion in debt. It’s the latest in a string of acquisitions for the Apontes, whose MSC overtook publicly traded Danish rival Maersk to become the world’s largest container shipping line in early 2022. Now, it’s set to overtake Maersk in terms of its port network as well. “[MSC’s] growth in liner shipping capacity has gone hand-in-glove with this huge expansion in terminal capacity,” says Eirik Hooper, senior associate of ports and terminals at maritime research firm Drewry. “The two businesses clearly support each other and provide opportunities for operational synergies at a huge scale.” For its part, BlackRock's investment in ports comes little more than a year after it announced the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, with the firm touting infrastructure as a $1 trillion market set to grow even further thanks to increasing investment in assets such as airports, railroads and shipping ports. BlackRock's billionaire CEO Larry Fink called infrastructure “one of the most exciting long-term investment opportunities" in a statement at the time. After the CK Hutchison deal closes—and unless local regulators require it to divest from the port it currently owns—MSC will hold stakes in three ports on the Panama Canal, with two on the Pacific Ocean side and one on the Atlantic. Even before the CK Hutchison deal, MSC has spent more than $40 billion since January 2022, according to Forbes estimates, investing in everything from new ports to hospitals and even a high-speed rail company in Italy. The bulk of that was new ships: over the past three years, the firm has bought or ordered 370 vessels for more than $31 billion, according to ship valuation experts VesselsValue. The secretive, closely-held MSC doesn’t publish financial data and declined to comment on them, but according to documents obtained by Italian newspaper Il Messaggero it ended 2022 with $68 billion in cash, thanks to a surge in freight rates during the pandemic as snarled supply chains powered shipping firms to record profits. Ownership of MSC is split equally between Aponte (the chairman, who was born in Italy but is now a Swiss citizen and lives in Geneva) and his wife Rafaela Aponte-Diamant, who helped him found the firm when he quit his job at a bank and started MSC with a $200,000 loan to buy their first ship in 1970. Forbes estimates they are each worth $37.5 billion, enough to make Aponte-Diamant the richest self-made woman in the world. That’s a combined $58 billion more than their estimated net worth in early 2022. A spokesperson for MSC declined to comment on the valuation and didn’t make either Aponte available for an interview. “Even before it was clear how good the pandemic would end up being [for shippers], Aponte was buying everything that was available and expanding,” says John McCown, a shipping expert at the think tank Center for Maritime Strategy. “It’s a bold strategy, but it’s worked out for them so far.” While the pandemic-driven boom helped all shippers, MSC benefited more than its rivals. According to Il Messaggero, it posted $93 billion in revenues and $46 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in 2022, beating out Maersk and CMA CGM, owned by the billionaire Saadé family of France. And even as its passenger cruise line suffered—swinging from a $456 million net profit in 2019 to a three-year run of Covid-induced net losses totalling more than $3 billion—the success of its container shipping business more than made up for it: MSC’s EBITDA rose by more than 600% from 2020 to 2022, compared to 350% for Maersk and 445% for CMA CGM. MSC used the cash it earned in the pandemic years to expand its empire beyond the sea, targeting companies that transport the goods to their final destinations on land as well as picking up firms in other areas of shipping outside of containers. Since January 2022, MSC has spent more than $3.6 billion buying up stakes in 10 companies including a trucking firm, a cargo airline, a car carrier, two logistic firms, a tugboat operator and a freight forwarding outfit, which acts as an intermediary between companies shipping products and their final destination, organizing the goods' transport by sea, rail, road or air. “These freight forwarding companies are just a way of feeding the monster. It's a source of additional volume,” says McCown. “With all the compelling growth that MSC is doing, that's not surprising." Flush with cash, MSC even partnered with South African billionaire Johann Rupert’s Remgro to buy South Africa-based Mediclinic, a chain of private hospitals, for $4.6 billion in August 2022. Its next big move outside of shipping came in October 2023, when it bought 50% of Italian high-speed rail firm Italo from Ogunlesi’s Global Infrastructure Partners for $2.2 billion. MSC has operated a cruise business since 1988 and bought a Mediterranean ferry company in 2010, but this was its first foray into passenger rail. Diego Aponte, Gianluigi and Rafaela's son and MSC's president, said in a statement at the time that the purchase reflected the group's "goal of further developing sustainable modes of transport, for both passengers and cargo.” The deal closed in May 2024, and it’s likely to become another good bet for Aponte: Italo posted a $178 million profit on $926 million revenues in 2023, up 36% and 21%, respectively, over the previous year. The Apontes had also been growing their ports empire before the CK Hutchison deal. MSC bought 50% of South Korea’s Busan port in March 2022, and eight months later it purchased Bolloré Africa Logistics—a collection of container terminals, dry ports, railways and logistics services owned by French billionaire Vincent Bolloré's Bolloré Group—for $5.9 billion. The acquisition made MSC the largest logistics firm in Africa and the seventh largest port owner in the world. Last November, it acquired a 49.9% stake in German publicly traded logistics company HHLA—which owns major ports in Hamburg, Estonia, Italy and Odessa, Ukraine—for $700 million. MSC owns the largest container shipping fleet in the world with 20% of total fleet capacity, ahead of its closest rivals Maersk (14%) and CMA CGM (12%), according to shipping data firm Alphaliner. “It's beneficial to have ports that you own. It allows you to get priority,” says Ben Slupecki, an analyst at Morningstar, pointing to the benefits of buying more ports alongside a larger fleet. “These are valued assets in the industry.” All of this has helped put MSC in a stronger position than ever and likely led to its announcement in January 2023 that it planned to end its 10-year partnership with Maersk, known as the 2M alliance. First set up in 2015, the alliance, which officially expired in January, allowed the two companies to lower costs by sharing capacity on 185 ships on routes traveling from ports in northern Europe and north America to Asia. Maersk has moved onto a different alliance while MSC is going alone. “They have 20% of global capacity, so they've achieved the size where they no longer need to operate an alliance,” adds Slupecki. Besides, with partners like Ogunlesi and now Fink’s BlackRock, it likely doesn’t need more support. And Aponte isn’t done expanding: his firm is reportedly planning to increase its stake in Spanish billionaire Vicente Boluda Fos’ tugboat firm Boluda Towage to 49% by May, which would make MSC the largest towage company in the world. MSC may not be able to keep up that high spending forever. After years of breakneck growth, the tide is turning for shipping firms. Freight prices have fallen from their peak in 2022, sitting about 50% higher than their levels before the pandemic in 2019. That slowdown, combined with the potential impact of Trump’s tariffs and any ensuing trade war, could put a damper on MSC’s profits. "If the tariffs stick, it'll put a real dent in container volume to and from the U.S. That's 25% to 30% of world container miles,” adds McCown. Still, that’s a relatively small slice of the global container trade. And while MSC may have to sell part of its ports in the Netherlands and Panama to appease regulators examining the CK Hutchison deal—plus fend off a potential Chinese government investigation into the agreement itself—it will still likely own stakes in more than 100 ports, more than anyone else. That size, combined with the fact it commands the world’s largest fleet of container ships, makes it less vulnerable than its competitors to any downturn. “The largest firms that have the ability to invest, like MSC, can probably weather a pretty big storm and come out the other side,” says Slupecki. “That might not be the case for some of their competitors. In some ways, that's an advantage for them to take further market share even if they struggle.”

Title: Chinese FM and HK chief executive respond to inquiries on CK Hutchison's controversial Panama deal

Global Times By Chen Qingqing Published: Mar 18, 2025 01:22 PM When asked whether the Chinese Foreign Ministry can confirm or give more details on media reports that Chinese authorities are investigating CK Hutchison's sale of its overseas ports after the company agreed to sell its Panama operations, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Tuesday that "on your specific question, I'd refer you to competent authorities. Let me stress more broadly that China firmly opposes moves that infringe on and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying." After two central government bodies in Hong Kong reposted two opinion pieces criticizing CK Hutchison Holdings for its decision to sell ports in Panama and elsewhere to an investment group led by an American asset manager BlackRock, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday, before attending the Executive Council meeting, that the HKSAR government expects foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for businesses, including Hong Kong enterprises, and opposes the use of coercion or pressure tactics in international economic and trade relations, Hong Kong media RTHK reported. When commenting on the matter on Tuesday, Lee expressed three views, according to Wen Wei Po. First, he noted that there has been much discussion in society about the issue, reflecting public concern, which deserves attention. Second, he emphasized that the HKSAR government expects foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for businesses, including Hong Kong enterprises, and opposes the use of coercion or pressure tactics. Third, he stated that any transaction must comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and the HKSAR government will handle the matter in accordance with the law and regulations, Wen Wei Po reported. Hong Kong-based Ta Kung Pao last week published two opinion pieces questioning the CK Hutchison's decision to sell the ports. In the Saturday piece, it asked, "Why are so many important ports so easily transferred to the US forces that harbor malicious intentions? What kind of political calculations are hidden behind the so-called commercial behavior on the surface? Has the so-called 'shrewd' deal taken into account the interests of the country and the nation? Is such a choice actually helping the evildoers and bringing harm to China and the world?" The article also warned if one fails to see clearly the true nature of those US politicians who "not only want money but also want you to die," and chooses to dance with them, one might perhaps manage to make a fortune for a while, but in the end, there will be no future, and what's more, one will incur the condemnation of history. Ta Kung Pao also published an opinion piece on Thursday saying that this deal is a hegemonic act in which the US uses its national power to usurp the legitimate rights and interests of other countries through coercion, pressure and inducement. It is a form of power politics dressed up as a "commercial act." The article urged relevant companies to think twice about the nature and crux of the issue, and also ponder about what stance to take and which side to stand on. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have reposted on their websites the two opinion pieces published by Ta Kung Pao. Leung Chun-ying, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, published a post on social media on Monday, asking without naming anyone: "Do businessmen have a motherland?" Wen Wei Po reported on Tuesday. Leung stated that some Hong Kong businessmen mistakenly believe in the notion that "business knows no borders" and assume that everything is purely business. However, businessmen without a motherland will only face bullying. He emphasized that businessmen should also prioritize their country. He pointed out that American businessmen can only act in alignment with US interests and cannot do anything that goes against them. He concluded that this inherent relationship between American businessmen and their country applies equally to other nations, including the UK, Canada, and Singaporeâ"and China is no exception." As the US is intensifying its efforts to undermine China's shipbuilding industry, shipping sector, and the Belt and Road Initiative in an attempt to contain China's rise, this deal would inevitably pose a threat to national interests and security, Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday. "I believe that before making business decisions, the company should fully and seriously consider the complexity of the international landscape and the well-being of the nation and its people. After all, key infrastructure holds significant strategic value, and its critical role in great-power competition should not be underestimated," Lau added.

Title: Tech employees are getting the message: Play time's over

For years, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke enjoyed a reputation for growing the $125 billion e-commerce company without working the grueling hours expected of startup founders. "My job is incredible, but it's also just a job. Family and personal health rank higher in my priority list," he wrote in a now-deleted post on X, then Twitter, shortly before the pandemic, as reported by Business Insider at the time. "The only times I worked more than 40 hours in a week was when I had the burning desire to do so." This year, even Lütke appeared to change his tune. "I'm at home for dinner but I work at least 10 or so hours a day and a lot of the weekend," Lütke wrote on X. He was responding to a user who called him a "counter-example" to a meme suggesting you can't have work-life balance and a breakthrough startup. "I don't want people to get misguided by this meme." Across tech, the tables have turned for employees as performance pressure and proclamations of "efficiency" and "intensity" replace perks and pampering. Sweeping layoffs have become the norm in an industry that, in recent memory, enjoyed job security. The pressure to dominate in AI has created intense competition, as companies use the technology to do more with fewer workers. Already hard-driving workplaces have become even harder. While the situation for tech employees has been changing since the pandemic boom ended in 2022, more recent developments include a decidedly different tone from executives. Now, companies aren't just making these changes; they want to be seen making them. Elon Musk's slash-and-burn tactics are now being embraced by Silicon Valley in the name of efficiency. At Twitter, Musk cut 80% of the staff — over 6,000 people. Years later, the company didn't collapse as some feared. And now, Musk's outsized influence on President Donald Trump and his administration has empowered both him and his cut throat strategies. CEOs of the biggest tech giants are following suit with similar tactics. Meta earlier this year said it was cutting 4,000 employees deemed low performers as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the "culturally neutered" corporate world had gotten away from "masculine energy." Amazon insisted that employees return to the workplace every weekday, a policy some employees say is stricter than before the pandemic. Other companies have cracked down, too. Microsoft, which was once referred to as a "country club" for its relatively lax culture, cut 2,000 employees as it overhauled its review process to eliminate underperformers more quickly. Google, which practically invented tech perks like free lunch, started an "efficiency drive." Its cofounder Sergey Brin, who had stepped away from leading Google but now often shows up to work on the company's Gemini AI models, recently recommended that employees working on its Gemini tools should work 60 hours a week and go into the office "at least every weekday." Wall Street has rewarded this rigor, as stock prices of Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's parent, Alphabet, have surged since 2022. Startups also see a trickle-down effect from Big Tech companies' pressures. Krish Ramadurai, a partner at AIX Ventures, said he had noticed a "pronounced shift" toward leaner teams and rigorous performance standards at startups. Between performance-based cuts, return-to-office mandates, and the stripping of workplace perks, it's clear not only that the tech industry is done coddling employees, but that companies want to send the message those days are over. BI interviewed employees from tech giants, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta, as well as various tech startups, about the changes. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity since they're not authorized to talk to the press, though their identities are known to BI. Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon did not comment. Shopify did not respond to a request for comment. For years, fierce competition for tech workers meant companies spoiled employees with astonishing salaries and swanky perks, such as in-office massages and free food cooked by fancy chefs. By 2022, tech companies seemingly couldn't throw enough money at workers. Early that year, Amazon more than doubled its maximum base salary, and Microsoft gave across-the-board raises to employees up to a certain level of seniority to dissuade them from leaving for competitors. As the pandemic boom ended, tech stocks plummeted, and interest rates increased through 2022. This prompted an efficiency drive by many companies as investors demanded profitability over growth at all costs. Also that year, companies watched the billionaire Elon Musk's handling of the Twitter acquisition, in which he cut thousands of employees, plus perks like free lunches, and demanded a commitment to a new "extremely hardcore" vision and "long hours at a high intensity." At one point, Twitter workers were begging on Slack for toilet paper and clean bathrooms amid Musk's drastic cost-cutting. As of late last year, Fidelity valued X at only about 20% of the $44 billion that Musk bought it for in 2022. Still, his approach may have expanded what the tech industry thought possible in terms of workforce and cost cutting. "People paid attention because the prevailing wisdom was you couldn't take out that much of an engineering organization and put that much instability on it and not have it fall over," Brad Porter, the founder and CEO of Cobot, told BI. "It did come close to falling. He pushed right to the edge of it actually falling over, but it didn't fall over." By the end of 2022 and in early 2023, tech giants had conducted unprecedented rounds of layoffs. Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft collectively laid off more than 60,000 employees during that time. Layoffs have remained at a steady drip across the industry since. Such cuts have become so frequent at Google, for example, that employees have taken to crowdsourcing information on layoffs in an internal Google Doc. Employees told BI about the pressure across the industry to "do more with less." "There's lots of uncertainty," one longtime Amazon employee said, "and lots of pressure to perform the jobs of multiple people at the mercy of ruthless middle management." Tech companies are also culling middle management layers. Amazon in September announced a plan to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% by the end of this month. In December, CEO Sundar Pichai told his staff that Google had cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of its efficiency drive. Microsoft also monitors what it calls "span of control," tracking the number of reports per manager. Amid the cuts, employees across the industry say companies are dialing up the performance demands. Meta told its staff in January that it would eliminate roughly 5% of its workforce, or about 4,000 employees, to "raise the bar on performance management," as Zuckerberg wrote in an internal memo. Google also increased pressure on employees. Perhaps most telling was Pichai's December comments attempting to clarify what "Googleyness" means for a modern Google. Once a squishy and vague philosophy for the search giant's corporate culture, Pichai said he believed it now meant, among other things, being "mission first." "There is more pressure for individuals to be better in their roles, and there is much more aggressive performance management happening these days," a longtime Google manager said. "We're being asked to do more for less," said another current longtime Google employee. That same Google employee said that Silicon Valley had been moving toward more ruthless, efficient workplaces for a while — and that the current political climate "gives them the green light to do it openly." Google has been working to become more efficient since its chief investment officer Ruth Porat joined the company as CFO from Morgan Stanley in 2015, "but now the masks are off," the person said. Microsoft was once referred to as the tech industry's "country club," meaning a place employees would go after they were done working hard in their careers and wanted to coast before retirement. A change this year shows how far Microsoft has shifted when it fired 2,000 employees deemed low performers without severance and ended their health benefits the same day. This kind of performance-based mass cut showed a shift for the tech giant. One longtime Microsoft senior-level employee said they felt that the "culture shifts toward firmer performance expectations" at peer tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon made it more acceptable for Microsoft to do the same. At TikTok, the pressure to perform jumped last year after the company directed managers to deliver more low scores in performance reviews, leading to PIPs and eventual exits. At the same time, six current and former employees told BI their goals had become much harder to hit. One staffer called the goals "unattainable." The company has also recently heightened RTO requirements for some teams. In February, it told its US e-commerce workers that in addition to being in the office five days a week, they would physically need to be in the building for eight hours a day. Ten current and former workers told BI that burnout had become common, leading to some going on mental health leave to get a break. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. "You feel like if you're not hitting a target, even if it's a moving target, you're in trouble," a former staffer who went on leave for mental health reasons told BI. "For me, it was just feeling like a failure, like I couldn't do anything right." The increasing pivot to performance has even made it to already hard-charging startups. Startups have a time-honored tradition of an always-on, work-first lifestyle. Early employees are expected to put in grueling hours of coding and customer support during this critical phase, known as the "valley of death," when startups are flush with initial funding but not yet profitable. The free-money era tested this tradition of hustle and thriftiness. Investors heaped money into small startups when interest rates bottomed out, and the blitz scaling that followed set off an arms race of perks to help startups attract top talent. Employees could work from home and set their own schedules. They pocketed wellness stipends and trotted the globe on extravagant off-sites. The tech startup Bolt gave many employees Fridays off. "I think many individuals — founders included — lost sight of the true goal of a company. It is to make money," Mang-Git Ng, the founder of Anvil, a paperwork automation company, told BI. Now, the executives who had lavished high salaries and fancy perks on their employees are resetting expectations, winding down remote work, and cutting head count. "Everyone who comes into our office at Decagon has opted into working with a team that's here because we want to do big things and see bigger and better results," said Jesse Zhang, the founder of Decagon, who now badges into the office six days a week. "There's no such thing as a rocketship that doesn't have a certain level of intensity to fuel its trajectory." Call it the Big Tech trickle-down effect. "Founders aren't sugarcoating it," said Natan Fisher, who runs a recruiting firm, SingleSprout, that specializes in hiring technical talent. "I've had a few cofounders tell employees they aren't working hard enough, and, 'If you're not all in, no hard feelings, we can give severance, but we can't slow down.' Late nights, weekends, even people crashing at the office, it's real." Have a tip? Contact Ashley Stewart via email at astewart@businessinsider.com or Signal at +1-425-344-8242.

Understanding quantum computing’s pace of progress is not an easy task. Recent months have complicated it with contradictory messages. CEOs like Jensen Huang (Nvidia) and Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) estimated that useful quantum computers were decades away, while others like Satya Nadella (Microsoft) and Sundar Pichai (Google) cast it as being just years from now. Some companies even stated that quantum computers would soon run LLMs more efficiently, with a lower energy footprint than classical HPCs running Nvidia GPUs. Your newsfeed is now full of imperatives: “the advent of useful quantum computers is not a matter of if, but when“, “this is the year to get ready” (whatever the year), “if you don’t jump in now, you’re late” (striking fear), such and such technology announcement “is a breakthrough” (Google Willow in December 2024, Microsoft Majorana-1 in February 2025), “we are getting closer to scalable quantum computers” (hopefully, not farther), “quantum computing progress is accelerating” (how do measure progress speed?), Google Willow or China’s Zuchongzhi quantum computers are already computing zillion “times faster than the largest classical supercomputer“, and so on! The stock market’s ups and downs shake the market cap of Rigetti, D-Wave and IonQ. Here, trust is not based on science but on buzz and beliefs, often only grounded on company’s investor decks and quarterly results. This is the characteristic of a “technology hype”, with its overpromises. These are fueled by research and industry vendor funding mechanisms, technology sovereignty issues, analysts and service companies’ opportunism and media buzz, which I described in an arXiv paper in 2022. End-user organizations and policymakers are also confused. You need a cold head to analyze this frenzy. You’re better off being embedded in the quantum ecosystem to know its stakes, but also, not being too much conflicted from the financial standpoint. Evaluating the quantum computing state of the art requires a broad scientific and technological background. If you are a quantum physicist, you may be too specialized, not knowing much about quantum algorithms. On the other hand, if you are a quantum software developer with not much knowledge of the hardware, you may not grasp the physics challenges to build a large scale quantum computer. And you are better off with having some knowledge of the state of the art in classical computing (GPUs, tensor networks, machine learning, etc.) against which quantum solutions are compared. So, here I am, with a couple of others, trying to bridge these gaps and to provide some understanding of the situation. To ease its reading, this paper is structured as a FAQ, addressing the following questions: It’s a bit like if you had 16 short papers for the price of one, given it’s free. If you cry very loudly, I can turn this into a series of 16 TikTok videos. Or maybe not… Still, you have a one liner blue response to all these questions. And then, elaborations! How to define utility-grade quantum computing? Who you are: a quantum physicist doing a Fermi-Hubbard simulation of some ferromagnetic material (example), a pharmaceutical company willing to simulate large molecular dynamics to design some new drug, a chemical company designing a new battery, a financial institution in search of better portfolio optimization techniques or a transportation company willing to optimize its operations? What benefit are you looking for: a quantum speedup, providing improved results like better chemical accuracy for some chemical simulation, a better solution with heuristics used to find approximate solutions of optimization problems, do something that is entirely impossible with classical computers, do stuff cheaper, with cheaper hardware or less energy? The definition of a “quantum computing advantage” is nowadays becoming multifactorial. Compared to what? The notion of usefulness is also not absolute but relative to classical computing. It can be against your own IT legacy or with best-in-class up-to-date classical solutions. Nvidia GPUs, deep learning techniques and classical tensor networks (MPS, DMRG) are continuously moving the goalpost for quantum computing to yield some quantum advantage. One interesting example is AlphaFold 3 from Google DeepMind, which does stuff initially thought only possible with future quantum computers in the 3D modeling predictions of complex organic molecules. At what cost? The value of anything new comes from computing its return on investment in comparison with competing solutions. With current quantum computers, this is a rarely debated aspect. Nobody really elaborates on the current and future prices of quantum computers. In the FTQC regime, it will become an important one, which will depend on the affordability of these systems. Hint: utility grade quantum computers supporting the thousand logical qubits and teraquops needed to run industry-grade applications may cost between $10M (which is acceptable) to several $1Bs (which is not), depending on the technology. This is like in quantum physics, it’s all about the measurement context! Variation of a slide from my QEI Workshop presentation showing how practical benefits are connected to the solution’s economics and business benefits (video, slides). One effect described in the above chart is the virtuous cycle that can come from platform and network effects coupled with the versatility of quantum computing systems. These could enlarge the quantum computing market and contribute to developing economies of scale, in turn driving prices down and extending its reach. This is the ultimate definition of “utility grade”. What quantum utility has been achieved so far? Consider IBM’s communication on “quantum utility” which started in June 2023 with the publication of a Nature paper and subsequent scientific papers related to the use of their most recent quantum computer (Eagle with 127 qubits, and, later, Heron with 133 or 156 qubits), or more recently, D-Wave with its 4,400 qubit Advantage 2 quantum annealer. These “utility cases” were about simulating some kicked Ising model for IBM, and the quench dynamics of two-, three- and infinite-dimensional spin glasses for D-Wave. This is about simulating the magnetism of materials at around 0K, a temperature found only in physics labs, at a scale supposedly unreachable by classical computers! These are interesting physics problems but far from any industry relevant problem. On top of that, both in both the IBM and D-Wave cases, subsequent papers argued that the quantum solution could be implemented classically, using tensor network methods, noticeably from the Flatiron Institute in New York (vs IBM and vs D-Wave). This spurs endless debates between the vendors and these classical computing specialists (example from D-Wave’s CEO). Right now, we have in-store quantum computers operating in gate-based mode like IBM’s, or using some analog processes like D-Wave quantum annealers or Pasqal/QuEra cold-atom-based quantum analog simulators. Quantum computing utility faces different challenges in all these cases due to algorithms resource requirements, theorical vs practical speedups, and (un)availability of fault-tolerant quantum computers of sufficient size. I ordered these who/what scenarios by order of potential appearance, spanning from now to 20 years. A chart positioning various use cases for quantum computing, from fundamental research to applied research and business operations. Current NISQ solutions seem to fare well in the first category. Future FTQC algorithms will probably bring some exponential speedups and improved results in the second category. The third one based on optimization and machine learning algorithms is more challenging at this point. Source: slides. You now understand why CEOs and commenters don’t look at the same target. Their wording and definitions are imprecise. BSI is focusing on cryptanalysis, so, as a threshold, breaking an RSA-2048 key using Shor integer factoring, while Jensen Huang talked about the fuzzy notion of useful quantum computers, probably thinking about doing stuff that is out of reach of existing and future classical systems. And when D-Wave touts quantum supremacy, it’s about implementing some physical simulation that happens to be useless for all companies. As a result, the irrelevance and standard deviation of all these CEO predictions are pretty high. But claiming that “the utility era is here” is clearly an overpromise, particularly, with mentioning the capability to solve some “real-world chemistry problem” with… two logical qubits! What is the difference between a use case and… a use case? Crafted in 1982, the notion of vaporware described a software or hardware product that was announced but released much later or even never released. One famous vaporware was the first version of Microsoft Windows that was announced in 1983 but released only in 1985. In the quantum world, this would be like releasing a product at the speed of light. Is quantum computing a modern version of vaporware? No! We have interesting algorithms and software that could provide some potential benefit. They “just” lack the quantum hardware to be executed and deployed. This explains why we have so many application “use cases” which are not real “use cases”. Most quantum computing use cases are small-scale prototype algorithms that are tested either in emulation mode or with NISQ quantum computers, often in a regime using so few qubits that they could be emulated on a simple laptop. In that situation, a laptop or simple server would be a more efficient solution with regards to computing time and solution cost. These use cases are frequently presented as “industry use cases”, which is ambiguous. It may mean “for the industry”, but not “in production”. Unfortunately, most of these use cases do not describe well the conditions to obtain some quantum advantage (problem size, number and quality of qubits, etc.). It even happens with scientific use cases like this recent one that is using a mere 16-qubit QPU. Use cases in analysts parlance, source: McKinsey. In 2023! These “use cases” can start to become interesting when they reach a regime where a classical quantum code emulation is impossible, even using tensor networks compression, when no equivalent classical solution can deliver a similar result in a reasonable time and when it is using real-life data sets. So far, this seems to be not yet possible for industry applications. When it happens, it sits in the “applied research” zone and not in the “industry utility” zone. It seems we’ll have to wait for FTQC QPUs to enable real-life industry use cases. For more insights on this, I published a framework to analyze use cases back in October 2023. Why are the first quantum utility use cases about simulating condensed matter physics at 0K and not solving your business problem? Simulating spin-glass models is easier with D-Wave annealers because they are themselves implementing spin models (below). Gate-based computers like the ones from IBM are also adapted to the implementation of spin models due among other things to their qubit layout. This is inline with the famous Richard Feynman’s motivation to build a quantum computer in 1981, laid out in the 1982 paper: Simulating Physics with Computers (22 pages). But chemical simulations are about simulating so-called fermionic models, when both gate-based and analog quantum computers are implementing bosonic models. As a result, computational problems that are not natively formulated as spin problems or bosonic problems need some conversion, which incurs a significant classical and quantum computing overhead. It is the same with solving combinatorial optimization problems. They can be mapped on quantum annealers or quantum analog simulators, but with some significant “embedding” overhead. All this explains why other problems require larger quantum computers, with our current knowledge of quantum algorithms. Hopefully, quantum hardware and algorithms are making progress and folks are still hopeful to find some Holy Grail there. What are the challenges of building utility-grade quantum computers? As a cofounder of the Quantum Energy Initiative with an engineering background and perspective, I am looking at the challenges ahead to build utility-grade quantum computers, particularly in the FTQC regime. Understanding, evaluating and optimizing the energetics of these systems must be based on a holistic scientific and engineering perspective, up to looking at the economics of quantum computers. This complements a bottom-up approach that is focused on determining the fundamental bounds of qubits operations, belonging to the fields of quantum energetics and quantum thermodynamics. In the second QEI Workshop held in Grenoble in January 2025, I had a chance to provide a view on current quantum computing roadmaps and their energetics aspects (video, slides). In this talk, I inventoried some challenges and connected them to dozens of scientific and engineering questions: I should add here various other scalability challenges like handling data preparation efficiently, particularly for solving linear equations and quantum machine learning tasks. Then, we are still in search of some potential qRAM, a memory type that is nearly mandatory to execute oracle-based algorithms. Then, each qubit type (or “modality”) has its own scalability challenges. They can be very different. For example, solid-state qubits like superconducting and silicon-spin qubits are fighting against decoherence, noise and crosstalk whereas photonic qubits are hampered by low photonic sources and detector efficiencies and losses along the paths in photonic integrated circuits and optical fibers. These are very different scientific and engineering challenges. What is the current TRL of quantum computers? A TRL, aka, technology readiness level, is a metric from 1 to 9 defined by NASA in the mid-1970s. It characterizes the level of maturity of a given technology or product. 1 stands for an idea in the head of a researcher and 9 for a widely deployed technology like your smartphone or laptop computer. In between are physical experiments, prototype products and the first products being deployed. The TRL of a product can also be characterized by the readiness of its related ecosystem (training, skills, applications, documented deployed case studies). Let’s consider the quantum TRL scale created by Kristel Michielsen in 2018, as shown below. According to this scale, quantum annealer’s TRL sits around 7 while gate-based systems are at around 5 given they are not yet commercially implementing quantum error correction. You can still buy a gate-based QPU with over a hundred physical qubit, like Cleveland Clinic who acquired a System One from IBM and installed it in Spring 2023, You can use them in the cloud through AWS, Microsoft, IBM or D-Wave online services. You can learn quantum programming and test your code. Even D-Wave has an (undocumented) SLA (service level agreement) should you use their online QPUs for production. There are already tens of thousands of quantum developers worldwide thanks to these systems being available online. You can test a 127-qubit IBM Eagle-generation QPU for free. But the TRL is also currently quite low when considering the usefulness of quantum computers with regards to their added value and cost. Let’s say you test an online quantum computer with 20 operational noisy qubits. The system probably costs several $Ms and its hourly usage is charged at about $2K. But $2K is the price of a laptop where you could run your quantum code in a free open source emulator. And it would even run faster than on the quantum computer. For a higher number of qubits on a current noisy quantum computer, the situation is blurred depending on your use case as explained when responding to the previous question. So, technically, quantum computers (QPU) TRL sits at around 5-8 depending on the case, but their actual value is still low compared to legacy classical systems. Are NISQ computers useful for the industry? NISQ computers are the current noisy qubit quantum computers. Those you can buy, rent or test today. The current wisdom is that, while they have some scientific value, their industry value is questionable. This is John Preskill’s view. I described NISQ challenges in a 2023 paper, and things have not significantly changed since then. The main NISQ recent advances come from some improvements in qubit numbers and fidelities, with both superconducting and ions qubits, and from the use of quantum error mitigation, a technique promoted among others by IBM. Some use cases are presented, like with the interesting work from Algorithmiq, a software startup based in Finland. A broad industry and academic team led by Sabrina Maniscalco, who is the CEO of Algorithmiq, published a paper willing to fight some myths on NISQ: Myths around quantum computation before full fault tolerance: What no-go theorems rule out and what they don’t by Zoltán Zimborás, Fernando G. S. L. Brandão, Elica Kyoseva, Ivano Tavernelli, Sabrina Maniscalco et al, arXiv, January 2025 (11 pages). It tried to show that the power and use cases of NISQ with quantum error mitigation could be expanded thanks to the upcoming improvements of qubit fidelities. However, the paper leaves the question open of whether NISQ systems will deliver some exponential or practical speedups. Another open question is lingering about the potential known and unknown limits of analog quantum computing. What is it to be pessimistic or optimistic? First, you need to understand where we are and to identify the scientific and engineering challenges ahead. Some are workable, others are really hard. It never necessarily means that “it’s impossible”. It is up to scientists and engineers to find solutions. You then need to appreciate how long it could take, understanding for example the lengths of the manufacturing-testing-experimenting cycles that dominate in this industry. These cycles are long! Usually, the more you know a topic, the less optimistic you may become because you understand the sheer weight of the challenges ahead. It can lead to sheer pessimism. Listening to educated pessimists should be used to challenge the optimists. But you can also be excited by these challenges and by human creativity. That’s my situation. I try to avoid flirting with optimism or pessimism, which are just two opposite moods. I stick to the scientific state of the art and remaining challenges. My own belief is that by doing so, you are neither pessimistic nor optimistic, you are just neutral with some optimism bias even though the pure optimists will perceive you as being a pessimist. So, pessimism or skepticism? Source. When you identify challenges in the quantum computing space, and there are many, most of them are currently being addressed in multiple ways by scientists and industry vendors. What can make you optimistic is that multiple technologies are being developed, like with the types of qubits or even with all the varieties of quantum algorithms around. How to grade the related scientific vs technology uncertainty? A common wisdom with many physicists, including the Nobel in physics laureates I met in Lindau in July 2024 is that the challenges ahead are mainly about engineering and technology developments. According to them, the theory is accepted and proven. But some scientists, like Alain Aspect, also think that creating large scale quantum computers may require significant time, a bit like the LIGO gravitational waves detection experiment which took about 25 years from design to completion (from 1989 to 2015). I do not entirely agree with that focus on engineering. While for sure, engineering and technology developments are inescapable routes to building fault-tolerant quantum computers, there are still some scientific uncertainties to unfold. A bit like the whole history of physics, experimenting new artificial settings will uncover new mysteries which may require building new theories, a bit like Zeeman’s effect discovered in 1896 could be explained only about 30 years later with electron spins. Here, we don’t know yet what we will discover when creating large-scale physical qubit systems. Will they showcase high-fidelity entanglement states at scale? How will we characterize it? Will we reach the famous Heisenberg cut, when macroscopic systems stop behaving quantumly with coherence and behave classically without it? Will we face the effects of the Lieb-Robinson bound that conditions the speed of correlation propagation in large scale entangled systems? It may affect large QPUs, particularly those which are implemented using quantum interconnect techniques. The confusion may come from the difference between theory and science in general. Quantum physics theory may be somewhat settled, but fundamental research and experimental research is still an open field. Another huge quantum computing scientific uncertainty lies with algorithms. We don’t have that many quantum algorithms and even fewer quantum algorithms with provable exponential speedups, or practical speedups with reasonable times. There is still a lot of fundamental research to do there. It is likewise with quantum error correction. How about new sources of correlated errors that we’ll discover with scalable systems and for which current error correction codes are not well adapted? In the technology realm, we don’t know yet if the improvement of chips manufacturing processes will yield better quality qubits. We need to test it. At last, how about various “unknown unknowns”? I’d say quantum computing is becoming a broad scientific experimental endeavor, mixing theoretical and experimental advances, one helping the other. We need these experiments to validate the theory and/or to extend it. We also need to accept failures and try various technology avenues. That’s why it doesn’t yet make much sense to launch a Manhattan like project on a specific qubit modality. It explains for example why DARPA is funding about 11 different such avenues as part of its Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) and Quantum Benchmark Initiative programs. What is the cost of trying these various avenues? Is it acceptable? It is currently mainly supported by a mix of public and private investments with a high proportion of the former. It will go on like this if the strategic stakes are perceived as being as high as they are today. A bird’s eye view on the realizations (green), challenges (orange/red), variations (grey) and paths to scalability (blue) for seven qubit types: superconducting, silicon, topological, cavities, cold atoms and trapped ions. They are all different! Source: Understanding Quantum Technologies 2024. Is the pace of progress of quantum computing accelerating? The perception of acceleration comes from industry vendor hyperbolic communication. Recent news pushed by large companies like Google and Microsoft are driving this impression. Microsoft oversold its topological qubit, that are supposedly around the corner. They are not! Too many scientific or industry communications are about “getting closer to scalable quantum computing” (example 1, example 2, example 3). I don’t believe there is some acceleration. There is progress for sure, but no acceleration. First and foremost, how do you measure acceleration and speed of progress? What is the comparable? What is the meter and unit? One way to proceed is to compare what scientific and technological advances have been achieved vs past plans. When I started working in the quantum computing space in 2018, I tracked the following announcements: Rigetti was planning to release a 128 qubit QPU in 2019, IonQ was mentioning that it had controlled 160 qubits on which it could handle operations on 79 qubits, and Intel was showcasing a silicon chip with the capacity to host 1,500 qubits in a chip thinner than a human hair. In 2019, Google had a 53 qubit chip (Sycamore) and IBM, a 65 qubit chip (Hummingbird r1). Where are we now, 6 to 7 years later? Rigetti’s best chip is Ankaa-3 with 84 qubits. IonQ is at 36 qubits with its Forte system while Intel has a vague 12-qubit chip named Tunnel Falls released in 2023, that is not integrated in a full QPU system. Google reached 105 qubits with its Willow chip announced between August and December 2024 and IBM has a 156-qubit chip. Meanwhile, these qubits fidelities have somewhat improved but not in a stellar way. IBM’s 433 Osprey and 1,121 Condor qubit chips which were released in late 2022 and 2023 were even discontinued in favor of smaller chips (Heron 156 qubits) due to their lack of tunable couplers. With these couplers, IBM’s Heron is faring well, at about 99.7% two-qubit gate fidelities, not far from what is currently achieved with trapped-ions (99.84% at Quantinuum with its H2-1 system). Still, all this doesn’t look like being exponential. It proved more challenging to increase the number of qubits of decent quality at intermediate scales of about a hundred physical qubits. You can see the trend in the updated scatter plot below. The blue dots are about superconducting qubits and the green ones with trapped ions. Cold atoms in orange seem to scale well but have a hard time exceeding two-qubit gate fidelities of 99.5%. Ions achieve that, faring at >99.8% but are still struggling with scaling. Superconducting qubits are in-between, with 99.7% two-qubit gate fidelities at between 105 and 156 physical qubits. In other qubit modalities, progress looked faster, like with cold atoms, first on large settings like Pasqal with the control of 828 atoms in 2024, and Caltech with 6,100 atoms, and then in gate-based mode (QuEra, starting in December 2023 with 48 basic logical qubits, Atom Computing with 24 logical qubits in November 2024). Photonic qubits are either locked at low qubit count in the non-scalable KLM paradigm (Quandela, Orca Computing, …) or are bound to implement FTQC scalable architecture in the more or less distant future (again with Quandela, with PsiQuantum, and Xanadu). Since 2018, we’ve also seen the emergence of new breeds of qubits implementing some autonomous error correction, like the cat-qubits from Alice&Bob and AWS, or the GKP qubits from Nord Quantique. These are encouraging new technology developments that may reduce the physical per logical qubits number overhead. There are several technical limitations to the # of qubits per monolithic quantum processors. It leads their designers to envision using various quantum interconnect solutions (microwaves, optical photons, transduction), which will bring a wealth of new challenges, from physics to quantum code compiling and optimization. We thus have to be very careful when extrapolating physical qubit numbers, particularly toward million qubit ranges. While there was significant progress in the field of quantum error correction, these advances were not well interpreted. For example, Google Willow’s logical qubit only corrects errors in a quantum memory, but not single or two qubit logical gate errors. It is thus far from being “fault-tolerant”. Likewise, the logical qubits created by QuEra and Quantinuum (with Microsoft) implement logical gates, but with the non-scalable trick of “post-selection”. It has the flavor of quantum error mitigation implemented in post-processing manner more than a fault-tolerant scheme adapted to running large quantum circuits. As I described in my Moore’s paper in 2023, scaling QPUs won’t probably follow any Moore’s law like with CMOS semiconductors because the scalability challenges are highly multidimensional. It’s not just a matter of shrinking transistors. I simplify things here since advances in CMOS were more complicated than that. Also, the test & learn cycles with various quantum computing technologies are relatively slow and don’t follow any Moore’s law. However, we may underappreciate some interesting technology developments happening in the background that will pay off later: on cryogenic control electronics, on high-density cabling, control signals multiplexing, high-power and low phase noise lasers, and with high-power cryogenics. The Coyote and Road Runner. A famous Warner cartoon known by boomers. Image source. Now, who’s who here? The Coyote may represent quantum computers while road runner is classical computing. And maybe, someday, it will be the other way around. What is special about quantum computing with regard to predictions? In the not-so-distant past, predictions abounded about how fast a technology revolution would be adopted. The cloud, mobile computing, Internet of things, and more recently the metaverse. Artificial intelligence made its comeback in two periods, one between 2012 and 2022 with machine learning and deep learning around data science concepts, and since 2022, with the advent of LLM-based chatbots. In these domains, the technology was more or less mature, but it had proven use cases that were beyond the state of the art. For example, mobile computing and cloud computing brought usability and easy access to multi-format communication on the go. In other domains like with IoT and metaverses, the generic user value was neither obvious nor universal. The uncertainties in these various domains were however not so much about the underlying science and technology, than on other factors: costs, ease of use, user value, physiological acceptability in the case of the metaverse, social impact and so on. With quantum computing, we are exposed to a flurry of market predictions including how much value it could generate, around $2T as soon as 2035 according to McKinsey before even the technology is ready. Even if it was ready in 2025, it would take more than 10 years to yield such value. You’d have to deploy it, to create algorithms, to run it, to try different options to create a digital twin of a new drug or chemical compound candidate. Then, you’d have to test it in the real world, either undertaking multi-year clinical tests or launching the buildout of new manufacturing plants. And so on. This takes time! McKinsey quantum monitor as of April 2024. Notice the $42B total government investment which is wrong due to bad estimated of China’s investments as well explained in The Quantum Panic – The U.S. wants to be prepared for whatever quantum technologies bring, but is it time to rightsize the threat from China? by Rachel Cheung, The Wire China, February 2025. How can we compare today’s situation and uncertainties with quantum computing to the ones we had 30 years ago or so in other domains? There were not many doubts back then about the progress ahead with raw computing power, memory, storage and networking capabilities growth. Moore’s law was kind of predictable, at least until the mid-2000s. Telecom infrastructures were key for developing the Internet and for smartphones and the cloud. There were some infrastructure built out delays for fiber installation around the world. However, this was not due to uncertainty in scientific or technology. It was more an economic issue. Also, many Internet developments benefited from the technology but were accelerated for societal reasons, like with the advent of the web 2.0 around 2004. There are some parallels to draw here with FTQC QPUs. At some point, they will become heavyweight infrastructure programs requiring significant funding, beyond classical research funding in the academic and startup world. In our analysis, we are often affected by a “survival bias”. We use the example of successes as proof of our reasoning, forgetting past failures. They don’t resonate in memories since they didn’t affect us much. In the mid-1980s, there was some buzz on GaAs electronics, that was supposed to supplant CMOS. It didn’t, mostly for engineering and economic reasons. Nanomaterials and graphene technologies had similar troubles, ranging from scientific and technology overpromises and societal backlash. Classical analog computing was promoted in the 1960s to 1970s but failed, being overcome by digital computing. It was not generic enough and didn’t scale well due to noise. Quantum computers are also analog to some extent, of course, with analog quantum systems ala Pasqal and D-Wave, but also with NISQ systems implementing arbitrary rotation gates. One key difference is that FTQC mixes analog and discrete operation, which is to enable quantum error correction, a feat that was not accessible to classical analog computers. Also, analog computing didn’t benefit from the same attention and public investments as we have right now with quantum computing. There was no equivalent of Shor’s algorithm to drive government interest. The EAI 8800 Analog computing system in 1986. Source. By the way, where are we with the promises of the Hyperloop, promoted by a certain Elon Musk in a 2013 white paper? Several ambitious infrastructure projects were supposed to be launched around the world. A couple startups were created. Twelve years later, it’s not really in the radar. The idea is plagued with a mix of engineering problems, safety problems, capacity and economic limitations and huge infrastructure costs. How about drones flying around to transport passengers from airports to cities? They can indeed fly. But with limited range, air trafic control challenges, economic challenges again, and so on. Now, let’s consider the Apollo program. It took only 8 years from JFK’s speech in May 1961 to Congress to having men landing on the Moon in July 1969. Yuri Gagarine had been sent to space a couple weeks earlier, in April. JFK confirmed the goal in another speech in September 1962, listing some technical challenges. Weeks from the start of the Cuban missiles crisis! Of course, the Moon quest project was fueled by huge investments but it was mostly about solving technology challenges. In 1961, engineers already knew how to launch a rocket and send a human into space. Newton’s laws were already vindicated. But there was the Cold War between the USA-USSR rivalry. Quantum computing seems much different and more challenging than all the above examples from the scientific and engineering perspective. There are superposed stacks of uncertainties from securing large scale entanglement to designing useful algorithm, and with relatively long test and learn cycles. And we have not yet started the real economical discussion about the price of these systems and their return on investment. From the scientific and engineering standpoint, quantum computing seems closer to nuclear fusion. Both are linked to the limits of physics and experimentation. The advantage of quantum computing is that it is way less capex intensive than nuclear fusion. At least at this point. Will quantum computers run LLMs more efficiently than classical computers? Some quantum computing companies like IonQ and Quantinuum are flirting with the idea that quantum computers may someday run LLMs more efficiently than classical computers. They could even be more energy efficient. What investors got from some IonQ presentation in 2024. Source. Unfortunately, quantum computers will probably not help mitigate the growth of energy consumption linked to consumer LLM based-generative AI. Data loading is quantum computers’ Achilles’ heel and will remain so for a long time given they will unlikely benefit from some hardware Moore’s law in relation to their clock speed. Given the size of both the training data (in petabytes and tera-tokens encoded in highly multidimensional vectors) and models (in tera-parameters), they won’t be loaded at a reasonable timescale on any quantum computer for training, even with some classical data ingestion and preparation. Variable computing and energetic costs are mostly in inferences which are run nearly real-time. Any quantum algorithms running in a quantum advantage regime will probably not be real-time. We can also use some simple logic here. An inference would require one quantum computer and there are hundreds of millions of users of these LLM chatbots. Unless some clever algorithm enables multiple inferences to run on single QPUs, this can’t scale well. There are no available resource estimates on how some FTQC quantum computers could handle any LLM task. The path to quantum transformers by David Wakeham, Xanadu, April 2024, provides sketchy classical and quantum computing requirements to train LLMs. It shows that even with very optimistic assumptions on the clock speed of quantum computers (in GHz), and with several tens of thousands of logical qubits, quantum computers would be faster than classical computers for the embedding part of LLM only after a couple decades, but this task could be run classically and only kernel operations handled quantumly (linear operations using block-encode matrices). Quantum linear algebra is all you need for Transformer architectures by Naixu Guo, Zhan Yu, Matthew Choi, Aman Agrawal, Kouhei Nakaji, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, and Patrick Rebentrost, arXiv, February-May 2024 (31 pages) states that “embedding large data into quantum computers is difficult in the absence of the availability of functioning quantum RAMs”. So maybe, we should invent the notion of qSLM for quantum small language models! However, the broader field of quantum artificial intelligence, not including LLMs for consumer chatbots, is a good exploration path, particularly when there is a need to use smaller data for training and to obtain better accuracy in inferences. Quantum machine learning can potentially be used for both training and inferences. There are still many technology interdependencies here: on data preparation and on the development of qRAM and on the connection between classical and quantum components of an AI solution. One thing is sure: classical AI already helps develop quantum technologies, in quantum error mitigation, quantum error correction at the error syndrome detection level, qubit calibration, and even circuit design (using custom Transformers). How about the if/when mantra? Analysts and others are frequently parroting the “if not when” mantra, saying that the question is not if scalable quantum computers will appear but when. As shown above, there are still many “ifs” which explain a lot of the uncertainty on the “when”. Otherwise, we would have an infinite certainty on the “when”. It is a bit like if “if” and “when” were complementary observables in Niels Bohr’s parlance. And due to Heisenberg indeterminacy principle, you can’t be precise on both observables. So if you dare want to be a bit more precise on the “when”, you need to be less accurate on the “if”. Should I wait, or should I go? That’s the typical question for end-user companies. Some analysts are playing with FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) to drive customers on the quantum computing bandwagon: human skills and quantum computing resources will be scarce, there will be a significant first-mover advantage, and your competitiveness will highly depend on your adoption of quantum technologies. I don’t believe any of these assertions to be true or verifiable. If quantum computers work at scale and benefit customers, hardware vendors will manufacture them and sell them. In the history of technology, even for large systems like supercomputers, there’s never been a real scarcity problem. And if there was one, it would mean that scalable quantum computers are way too large and costly. Then, human skills can follow-on. We already have a good stream of young people being trained. Finally, your competitiveness may only marginally depend on quantum computing. Some early adopters of quantum computing in Europe across multiple verticals: energy utilities, chemicals, telecoms, financial services, air/defense, automotive and transportation. Source: OE. Still, I would advise customers to invest in quantum computing. Am I contradicting myself? No, I’m just basing my rationale on different arguments. One is that testing quantum computing is not expensive and is part of any techno-screening of any large company. You don’t need to acquire a $40M QPU. You can rent it for cheap in the cloud. You can even learn quantum coding with free open source emulators. Second, learning quantum computing is an excellent way to revisit your existing applications portfolio. It helps you identify pain points in scalability or output quality, revisiting the algorithms you are using. At some point, it will help you modernize your IT, and not necessarily with quantum computing. You may land in using GPUs and/or tensor network “quantum inspired” classical applications. Learning about quantum computing can help you upgrade your algorithms teams. It will push them to develop better mathematical skills, like in the financial services vertical. It will also help customers deal with the aggressive push from industry vendors and to decipher the continuous news stream. In just one week, you’ll have thousand of talks from quantum physicists at the APS March Meeting held in Anaheim, and the Nvidia Quantum Computing Day in San Francisco, hosting a dozen quantum computing vendors. Get ready for a flurry of announcements! Of course, another minimal task to launch is the audit and upgrade of the company cybersecurity infrastructure. Whether you like it or not, you’ll have to fold in deploying post-quantum cryptography. So, learn quantum computing at small scale, educate your own technical people, try small things, be ready to adopt the technology should quantum computing scale well on a reasonable time horizon. How to interpret the quantum stocks’ ups and downs? In Summer 2024, Rigetti and D-Wave risked being delisted from the Nasdaq due to their stock becoming for some time a “penny stock”, valued at less than a US dollar. But in October 2024, they escaped this dangerous zone. Then, Google’s Willow PR blitz in December 2024 drove the stock to sky highs. It happened also with IonQ’s stock, which was not endangered. In January 2025, Jensen Huang’s declaration created a sharp drop in value for all these stocks and they rebounded relatively fast afterwards, then fell down again, and are up again since the beginning of March 2025. What was the rationale here? You may wonder. Google Willow advancements had no connection at all with IonQ’s roadmap. Rigetti is a direct technology competitor of Google, but lagging behind it. And D-Wave? It’s been struggling for a while at generating some decent revenue. And the company is now over 25-year old. It seems to be a rare case of a company losing money for such a long time, although it became public only in 2022. These stock values are driven by a mix of volatile human sentiments and machine-based automated triggers. Chart showing Rigetti, IonQ and D-Wave stock value evolution over one sliding year (source). Now let’s have some fun and look at the roadmaps, past revenue forecasts and actual results for these traded companies, which all went public using the shady SPAC funding vehicle. Rigetti’s 2021 roadmap announced that they would obtain a “broad quantum advantage” in 2025. How many use cases do they have with their 84-qubit QPUs? Not many, besides some QEC experiment with Riverlane announced in October 2024. Their qubit quality is too bad to do useful NISQ stuff, even with using quantum error mitigation. Their revenue projection was $73M for 2024 and $288M for 2025. In March 2025, they reported a revenue of $10.7 for 2024, while 2023 was at $12M. And a loss of $201M! D-Wave’s 2022 investor presentation was forecasting a revenue of $72M in 2024 and $219 for 2025. Actual revenue for 2024 was $8.8M while 2023 was at $8.7M. Not stellar exponential growth either! In its 2021 investor presentation, IonQ planned to reach 64 “algorithmic qubits” by 2025 with a 16:1 error-correction encoding, meaning a thousand physical qubits if I count well. And 2024 revenues of $60M. The actual was not that far, with $43M, although, mostly thanks to US federal commitments from AFRL. And they currently have only 36 operational qubits. The wake-up call for investors is hard, as shown in Kerrisdal Capital’s recent short-selling and well-documented report! Now, they just acquired IDQ with a $250M stock swap with SK Telecom. The rationale? Revenue diversification and patent portfolio consolidation! That’s not a pretty picture from the investor standpoint. We must recognize that all startups have the same problem. They make inflated sales forecasts to attract investors and then usually fail to deliver it. The big difference here is that this is not linked to some sales or competition shortcomings, or lack of some viral effects like in web consumer space, but because the technology is not yet there to capture the target market. Still, the market value of these companies totals over $10B ($3.15B for D-Wave, $2.75B for Rigetti, and $5.41B for IonQ). I have observed how IonQ investors on X were disappointed by the company’s quarterly results. Seemingly, they didn’t talk much with scientists and technology specialists to forge an educated opinion about the company. All investors are misled by a superposition of over-expectations: on the potential business value of quantum computers (culprits: McKinsey and BCG), on the related revenue opportunity (culprits: same folks), on the technology roadmap (culprits: most vendors and analysts, including Google and Microsoft), and on the difficulty of creating useful quantum computers. In comparison, IBM looks like a sane player, being more careful with its promises and roadmaps. Now, these three traded companies are not the best-in-class QPU vendors around. There are many other vendors who are not yet traded. Some are advancing their R&D quietly, avoid overselling their hardware, and adopt a long-term ploy. They benefit from a mix of private and public funding, including public procurements like with the EuroHPC program in the European Union. Conclusion The quantum scene is becoming the theater of double-speak with utility, use case, industry-grade, acceleration, if, and when, where the present and the future collide in the public discourse. Thanks for reading this paper until the end. What key question did I miss out?

Title: Don't call it a recession — but bad vibes are back in a big way

Americans aren't thrilled about the economy. Business Insider has heard from retirees watching their investments fluctuate in the stock market, parents struggling with the high cost of groceries and childcare, and business leaders bracing for a downturn. This comes alongside the Trump administration's roller-coaster tariff announcements and sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. The US may not be in a recession yet — but we are in a vibecession. This growing distrust could have serious consequences, as a fear-driven pullback in spending is one step toward an actual downturn. Cynical shoppers may avoid nonessential purchases, businesses could pause hiring, and investors might step back from the market. And the slower the economy, the weaker it becomes. "There's a massive amount of uncertainty that's really weighing on people," said Joanne Hsu, who oversees the closely watched University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment, which in March dropped to its lowest point in three years. "People are really worried that these policies are going to lead to a resurgence in inflation. We're seeing a deterioration in views related to the overall economy, which is related to personal finances, inflation, and most critically, labor markets." The vibecession rears its head whenever Americans are feeling particularly uncertain about the economy. Even if the major economic indicators aren't alarming on paper, rapid changes on Wall Street and in the White House historically make consumers and businesses nervous. Many consumers are worried about how federal policy will shape the cost of essentials such as groceries and housing. The Consumer Sentiment Index — which is based on surveys and interviews with hundreds of US adults by researchers at the University of Michigan — decreased by 16.1 points between December and March. That's the sharpest three-month drop since the pandemic began in 2020. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has climbed over 60 points since December, a much higher-than-typical jump. The measure is based on how often major media outlets are reporting on economic uncertainty, the frequency of disagreement among economic forecasters, and other factors. The research firm Civiqs also found that over a quarter of Americans believe the economy is doing "very bad" right now. Google searches for "recession" have spiked in the past 30 days. Among consumers, Trump is losing ground on what has historically been his — and the GOP's — strongest issue. The majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's second-term job performance on the economy (54% disapprove) and how he's handling inflation and cost of living (55% disapprove), per an NBC News poll published March 16. "If people both think the economy is deteriorating and they expect their own incomes to weaken as well, it's hard to imagine how robust consumer spending can really be under those circumstances," Hsu said. Businesses aren't escaping the vibescession either. Many CEOs and executives are worried that the economic uncertainty will put a damper on profits, hiring, and growth. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that general business conditions, new orders and shipments, employment levels, and financial optimism have all declined among businesses across the state in 2025. "Small businesses have particularly few options and little wiggle room to deal with the sheer size of the tariffs in the pipeline," Diane Swonk, the chief economist at KPMG, told BI in an email. "They both squeeze profits margins and prompt cuts to staff, while boosting prices." At the C-Suite level, some companies' plans for hiring and capital investment, as well as sales projections, have decreased since Trump's inauguration, a survey of 150 CEOs by Business Roundtable found. Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten wrote in the March survey report that the downward trends are based on "several factors, including signs of economic headwinds and an atmosphere of uncertainty in Washington." Vibecessions aren't new. Consumer sentiment also dipped during and shortly after the pandemic and again ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Instability in the stock market, high inflation, and job losses often lead to widespread financial anxiety. Still, Americans' current pessimism about the economy is notable. The present vibecession comes in the context of declines in the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq in recent weeks. While the markets have shown some signs of recovery, they remain well below their February highs. Trump's steep — and quickly shifting — tariff policies have also left US businesses and consumers expecting a significant jump in prices for things like food, construction materials, electronics, and alcohol. Inflation has eased from its post-pandemic highs, but many shoppers feel like their budgets are stretched thin. The chaos around the availability and cost of eggs, for example, has become a symbol of overall inflation fears. The Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency have added to that uncertainty by firing thousands of federal workers and slashing the budgets of several government programs. Layoffs also hit major companies like Meta, Amazon, Southwest, and others in rapid succession, further fueling the public's perception of economic turmoil. This comes as the white-collar job market has been increasingly difficult to break into, despite overall unemployment rates holding steady. Hsu told BI that consumer sentiment patterns typically fall along party lines — Democrats feel more economically confident when the president is a Democrat, and Republicans more confident under Republican administrations. But in the past few months, consumer sentiment has significantly declined among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. The US isn't in a true recession. Economists and financial analysts told BI that economic downturns are measured on several factors, including long-term labor market and consumer spending data. A few weeks of stock market and policy instability aren't enough to call a recession. Still, even if the US economy isn't doing as badly as Americans imagine, a vibecession changes consumer behavior. People are likely to tighten their spending on nonessentials and delay major purchases, which could disrupt the travel industry and the housing market. Some small businesses and major corporations have also signaled that they plan to pass the price of Trump's tariffs onto consumers, which could contribute to shoppers buying less. "Moral of the story is that when uncertainty spikes, we tend to err on the side of caution and delay big spending decisions," Swonk said. "We are seeing that base emotion play out in real time in the overall economy." Retirees and hopeful retirees told BI that they are adjusting their stock market and 401(k) investments to be more conservative. Hsu said job seekers may also become less likely to leave their current jobs or seek outside promotions, affecting labor market churn. The stock market has shown signs of recovery in the past few days, but America's latest vibecession isn't over — and the future is hard to predict. "We're in a really unprecedented policy environment," Hsu said. "With policy changing every day, and every hour in some situations, it's really hard for consumers to plan in a meaningful way."

(ABC News: Joel Wilson) Administrators have been appointed to run the majority of Genius Childcare centres. The ABC has also found Australia’s industrial watchdog has received at least 30 requests for help from Genius workers. Genius owner Darren Misquitta did not respond to requests for comment. Administrators have taken control of the majority of childcare centres run by teetering empire Genius. Nicholas Charlwood, Alan Walker, and Glenn Livingstone of WLP Restructuring took control of 12 centres on Wednesday, bringing the total they control to 25. The ABC can also reveal that dozens of workers at Genius have lodged formal complaints about wage underpayment since 2016. Documents obtained under Freedom of Information (FOI) laws show Australia’s industrial watchdog has received at least 30 requests for help from workers at Genius, which is run by Melbourne businessman Darren Misquitta. The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is investigating the group, a spokesperson told the ABC, as more employees face uncertainty in the wake of the collapses. Dozens of Genius workers have lodged complaints via the Fair Work Ombudsman. (ABC News: Joel Wilson) Genius’s financial woes come as the childcare industry is in the spotlight following a Four Corners investigation on Monday that raised concerns about child safety and revealed the sector is plagued by poor regulation and high staff turnover. Until recently, Genius was a rapidly-expanding childcare empire with at least 28 centres across the country and another 17 in development. But yesterday WLP’s partners were appointed administrators of subsidiary Abacus 49, which runs 12 centres in Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and Western Australia. The administrators said they will continue to run the centres as usual while “urgently assessing the financial affairs of Abacus 49”. Finexia, a Gold Coast-based finance group that runs childcare funds, appointed the same administrators last week to take control of another Genius subsidiary, Vertical 4. The administrators are continuing to run 11 centres owned by Vertical 4. The new collapses add to the sudden shut down of centres in Adelaide, Canberra and Sydney which are in various states of collapse due to staff walkouts because of unpaid wages, landlord disputes and suspensions by state regulators for repeated child health and safety breaches. Another company in the Genius group, Horizontal 1, collapsed in December owing $9.6m. In a report to creditors last month, liquidator Paul Vartelas said Horizontal 1, which was formerly known as Genius Education, “did not have sufficient realisable current assets available to meet its short-term liabilities at any time” since June 30, 2020. Genius Childcare owner Darren Misquitta is accused of systematically and deliberately failing to pay superannuation to employees and paying wages late. (LinkedIn) Other woes of the Genius group include a lawsuit by former employees who allege they haven’t been paid their entitlements. Jodie Henderson told the ABC she is owed at least $36,000 in unpaid redundancy entitlements and hundreds of annual leave hours, after the centre she managed in Granville, Queensland, closed abruptly last month. It was ousted by centre landlords, who changed the locks without staff knowledge, owing thousands of dollars in unpaid rent and weeks of pay to 19 now-redundant educators. “I’ve got educators who have defaulted on loan payments, mortgage payments … I’ve got educators going to food banks and to churches to get support with feeding their families,” Ms Henderson said. Jodie Henderson says Genius Childcare owes her thousands of dollars. (Supplied: Jodie Henderson) Ms Henderson said Genius had failed to issue redundant staff with separation certificates making it difficult for them to claim urgent unemployment benefits. “Between my team and myself, I’m going to estimate we’ve sent at least 40 to 50 emails to payroll requesting them, [asking] 'can you tell us what’s happening?'” she said. “And none of us have had responses.” She said staff and children had personal and medical belongings locked inside the centre, including epipens and asthma puffers. “This is most definitely the lowest of the low,” she said. “It’s left a lot of people with a very bad view of working in the early childhood sector.” Documents provided by the FWO under FOI laws show Genius workers have complained that the company hasn’t paid their full wages, given them incorrect payslips, failed to pay them for up to six weeks and failed to pay leave entitlements and superannuation. “They are ignoring me,” one former worker, who claimed Genius hadn’t paid their final wages plus annual and long service leave, told the ombudsman in a November 2016 request for assistance. Concerns about the group’s financial state were raised as early as November 2017, when a fired worker complained that she had not received her last two weeks pay and her entitlements. “They dismissed two other EEs (employees) at the same time so they may be in financial difficulties,” the worker alleged in her complaint, according to a file note. Another worker alleged she was fired from Genius after raising problems with her pay. Complaints against Genius Childcare were filed as early as 2016. (Supplied) In a 2021 complaint, a worker said that because their centre was understaffed they had to work large amounts of unpaid overtime in order to comply with minimum staff to child ratios. “The overtime I worked was due to not having enough staff therefore in the afternoons we would have to stay back until the ratio dropped enough that we could go home,” the worker said in an email to the FWO. In November last year, multiple staff complained that the company was paying wages late. One Genius worker said that “no staff have been paid, pay is late from everyone”, according to a file note made by an officer at the ombudsman. “Staff are calling management but have not heard back.” A second worker told the FWO “the entirety of the company have experienced late pay” for the past year. “She believes she was paid because the staff did not show up to work on Monday and told the business they had other job interviews lined up and they were paid within 20 minutes,” an FWO officer said in a file note. Vertical 4, which was formerly known as Genius Learning, was also embroiled in a legal stoush with global fund management giant Blackrock over unpaid rent. Court documents show a property fund run by Blackrock claims to be owed more than $1.4m in rent from centres in Granville (Queensland), Corinda (Queensland), Christie Downs (South Australia) and Cranbourne West (Victoria). The administrators have plans to sell some centres and operate others in the meantime. (ABC News: Joel Wilson) Mr Charlwood, Mr Livingstone and Mr Walker said that of the 11 Vertical 4 centres they are running, there were agreements in place to immediately sell five — in Mont Albert (Victoria), Beaumaris (Victoria), Reservoir (Victoria), Kenmore (Queensland) and Gowrie (ACT). Six of the centres — in Hamilton Hill (Western Australia), Lakelands (WA), Mandurah (WA), Newcomb (Victoria), Castle Hill (NSW) and Pyrmont (NSW) — will continue to be operated by the administrators for the time being. Two additional centres, in Eumemmerring (Victoria) and Cranbourne West (Victoria), have yet to open. Mr Misquitta did not respond to requests for comment.

Title: Bird flu is a rerun of the COVID playbook

(Article byÂ Clayton J. BakerÂ republished from Brownstone.org) In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this:Â Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script.Â There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterroristsÂ directlyÂ blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists areÂ indirectlyÂ blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Letâs review. What happened during Covid? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, âpublic healthâ authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. To perpetuate the lockdowns, âpublic healthâ authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. Authorities are using this excessive testing along withÂ media-generated fear-mongeringÂ and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The âpandemic plannersâ are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Hereâs how: End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately.Â ThisÂ disgusting, death-wish practiceÂ is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns duringÂ Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately.Â A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment â you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDAâs leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled.Â All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trumpâs entire second term. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.Â TheÂ CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trumpâs executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon theÂ Covid-era âpandemic planningâ model of public health. For example, acting directorÂ Susan Monarez, PhDâs bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. TheÂ Kawaoka Bird flu labÂ at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has hadÂ multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry.Â Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. President Trump should follow through on hisÂ 2024 promiseÂ to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR).Â Mr. Trumpâs instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trumpâs inauguration should be cancelled.Â The USDAâs reported âconditional approvalâ of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled.Â Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks hasÂ been demonstratedÂ in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, theÂ CEOÂ of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and theÂ Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The âpandemic preparednessâ racket isnât as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact thatÂ the arsonists are running the fire departmentÂ â as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well â we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. Authorities are using this excessive testing along withÂ media-generated fear-mongeringÂ and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The âpandemic plannersâ are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Hereâs how: End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately.Â ThisÂ disgusting, death-wish practiceÂ is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns duringÂ Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately.Â A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment â you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDAâs leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled.Â All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trumpâs entire second term. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.Â TheÂ CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trumpâs executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon theÂ Covid-era âpandemic planningâ model of public health. For example, acting directorÂ Susan Monarez, PhDâs bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. TheÂ Kawaoka Bird flu labÂ at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has hadÂ multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry.Â Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. President Trump should follow through on hisÂ 2024 promiseÂ to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR).Â Mr. Trumpâs instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trumpâs inauguration should be cancelled.Â The USDAâs reported âconditional approvalâ of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled.Â Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks hasÂ been demonstratedÂ in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, theÂ CEOÂ of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and theÂ Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The âpandemic preparednessâ racket isnât as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact thatÂ the arsonists are running the fire departmentÂ â as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well â we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this:Â Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script.Â There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterroristsÂ directlyÂ blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists areÂ indirectlyÂ blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Letâs review. What happened during Covid? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, âpublic healthâ authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. To perpetuate the lockdowns, âpublic healthâ authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives.

This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists areÂ indirectlyÂ blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Letâs review. What happened during Covid? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, âpublic healthâ authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. To perpetuate the lockdowns, âpublic healthâ authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. Authorities are using this excessive testing along withÂ media-generated fear-mongeringÂ and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The âpandemic plannersâ are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Hereâs how: End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately.Â ThisÂ disgusting, death-wish practiceÂ is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns duringÂ Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately.Â A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment â you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDAâs leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled.Â All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trumpâs entire second term. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.Â TheÂ CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trumpâs executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon theÂ Covid-era âpandemic planningâ model of public health. For example, acting directorÂ Susan Monarez, PhDâs bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. TheÂ Kawaoka Bird flu labÂ at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has hadÂ multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry.Â Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. President Trump should follow through on hisÂ 2024 promiseÂ to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR).Â Mr. Trumpâs instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trumpâs inauguration should be cancelled.Â The USDAâs reported âconditional approvalâ of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled.Â Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks hasÂ been demonstratedÂ in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, theÂ CEOÂ of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and theÂ Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The âpandemic preparednessâ racket isnât as complicated as it seems.

Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, âpublic healthâ authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. To perpetuate the lockdowns, âpublic healthâ authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. Authorities are using this excessive testing along withÂ media-generated fear-mongeringÂ and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The âpandemic plannersâ are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Hereâs how: End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately.Â ThisÂ disgusting, death-wish practiceÂ is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns duringÂ Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately.Â A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment â you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDAâs leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled.Â All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trumpâs entire second term. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.Â TheÂ CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trumpâs executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon theÂ Covid-era âpandemic planningâ model of public health. For example, acting directorÂ Susan Monarez, PhDâs bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. TheÂ Kawaoka Bird flu labÂ at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has hadÂ multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry.Â Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. President Trump should follow through on hisÂ 2024 promiseÂ to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR).Â Mr. Trumpâs instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trumpâs inauguration should be cancelled.Â The USDAâs reported âconditional approvalâ of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled.Â Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks hasÂ been demonstratedÂ in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, theÂ CEOÂ of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and theÂ Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The âpandemic preparednessâ racket isnât as complicated as it seems.

While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, âpublic healthâ authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. To perpetuate the lockdowns, âpublic healthâ authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses.

What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. Authorities are using this excessive testing along withÂ media-generated fear-mongeringÂ and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The âpandemic plannersâ are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Hereâs how: End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately.Â ThisÂ disgusting, death-wish practiceÂ is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns duringÂ Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately.Â A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment â you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDAâs leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled.Â All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trumpâs entire second term. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.Â TheÂ CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trumpâs executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon theÂ Covid-era âpandemic planningâ model of public health. For example, acting directorÂ Susan Monarez, PhDâs bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. TheÂ Kawaoka Bird flu labÂ at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has hadÂ multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry.Â Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. President Trump should follow through on hisÂ 2024 promiseÂ to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR).Â Mr. Trumpâs instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trumpâs inauguration should be cancelled.Â The USDAâs reported âconditional approvalâ of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled.Â Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks hasÂ been demonstratedÂ in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, theÂ CEOÂ of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and theÂ Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The âpandemic preparednessâ racket isnât as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact thatÂ the arsonists are running the fire departmentÂ â as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well â we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

For example, acting directorÂ Susan Monarez, PhDâs bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC?

The Next Generation of AI-Optimized InfrastructureBuilding on its commitment to provide customers with the most advanced AI infrastructure, Google Cloud will be one of the first companies to offer the latest instances of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs — NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 and NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition. Built on the groundbreaking Blackwell architecture introduced a year ago, Blackwell Ultra includes the NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 rack-scale solution and the NVIDIA HGX™ B300 NVL16 system. The GB300 NVL72 delivers 1.5x more AI performance than the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, as well as increases Blackwell’s revenue opportunity by 50x for AI factories, compared with those built with NVIDIA Hopper™. NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell is the ultimate universal GPU for both AI and visual computing workloads across healthcare, manufacturing, retail, live broadcast and other industries. With last month’s preview launches of its A4 and A4X virtual machines, Google Cloud became the first cloud provider to offer both NVIDIA B200- and GB200-based instances. Now, A4 is generally available — with A4X coming soon — so customers can take advantage of Blackwell’s powerful performance with the added benefits of Google Cloud’s AI Hypercomputer. Google Cloud and NVIDIA have worked together to optimize popular open-source frameworks like JAX, a popular Python library for machine learning, and MaxText to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs at scale.

At its annual developer conference GTC in San Jose, Calif. today (Mar. 18), Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled two upcoming GPU architectures: Blackwell Ultra and Rubin. During his opening keynote, CEO Jensen Huang laid out the chipmaker’s ambitious vision to propel A.I. into an era of industrial-scale computing. Huang called GTC the “Super Bowl of A.I.”—with one key distinction: “At this Super Bowl, everyone wins,” he said. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Blackwell Ultra is expected to launch in the second half of 2025. Its successor, Rubin, is slated for late 2026, followed by the more advanced Rubin Ultra in 2027. Currently in production, Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra series is an advanced iteration of the Blackwell chips unveiled at last year’s GTC, which are 40 times more powerful than the previous-generation Hopper chips, Huang said. Blackwell Ultra will incorporate eight stacks of 12-Hi HBM4E memory, providing 288GB of onboard memory. The architecture will feature NVLink 72, an upgraded high-speed interconnect technology designed to facilitate communication between GPUs and CPUs—crucial for processing the massive datasets required for A.I. training and inference. “NVLink connects multiple GPUs, turning them into a single GPU,” Huang explained. “It addresses the scale-up problem by enabling massive parallel computing.” In addition, the company unveiled the Nvidia RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition, engineered for enterprise workloads such as multimodal A.I. inference, immersive content creation and scientific computing. With 96GB of GDDR7 memory and support for multi-instance GPU technology, the RTX PRO 6000 is designed to power advanced A.I. development. Blackwell’s successor, Rubin, is named after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter in space. The initial version of the Rubin chip is expected to achieve 50 petaflops of speed during A.I. model execution. The more powerful Rubin Ultra can deliver up to 100 petaflops of performance, which Huang called a “major step forward” in A.I. processing and performance power. Early iterations of the Blackwell chips and racks reportedly faced overheating issues, leading some customers to reduce their orders. The newly introduced liquid-cooled Grace Blackwell 200 NVL72 system addresses these concerns, offering up to 30 times faster real-time inference for trillion-parameter large language models and up to four times faster training compared to Nvidia’s previous-generation H100 GPU. It can generate up to 12,000 tokens per second—the basic units processed by A.I. models—dramatically accelerating both training and inference. “If you want your A.I. to be smarter, it must generate more tokens. That requires massive bandwidth, floating-point operations and memory,” said Huang. He also explained that reasoning A.I. models such as DeepSeek’s R1 model require 20 times more tokens and 105 times more computing power. Nvidia is also collaborating closely with Taiwan’s TSMC to develop data packaging technologies for data centers, a move that could substantially enhance computational efficiency and thermal demands in future GPU generations. Huang also outlined Nvidia’s roadmap beyond Rubin. “The next generation of architectures after Rubin will be named Feynman,” he said, confirming that Feynman HBM is already in development and slated for release in 2028. Named after Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist known for his contributions to quantum mechanics, this upcoming architecture is expected to push A.I. performance to unprecedented levels. The announcements came on the heels of Nvidia’s better-than-expected first-quarter earnings results, driven by a surging demand for its GPUs. Despite increasing competition from rivals like AMD and geopolitical uncertainties including export restrictions on semiconductors, Nvidia currently dominates the global GPU market with an estimated 80 percent market share, according to a report by Nasdaq.

The DeFi sector is “substantially undervalued,” Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said Tuesday in an interview with Decrypt, arguing Layer-1 blockchains such as Sui and Aptos “definitely tick the boxes” for courting institutional investors. The executive said he sees a case for issuers launching SUI and Apots ETFs in the U.S.—a development that may bring renewed investments into those altcoins. The asset manager already filed for an Aptos ETF earlier this month, but it has no such application pending for a SUI-based fund. Still, projects led by ex-Meta stablecoin team members “definitely tick the boxes of serious team, serious technology [and] technological differentiation,” Hougan said, referencing a few of Bitwise’s requirements for the assets held by its funds. “I wouldn't put 100% of my portfolio in Sui, but I wouldn't put [in] zero,” he said. Bitwise is one of several investment firms that has filed a flurry of crypto ETF applications with federal regulators in the U.S. The spate of applications comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission— the crypto industry’s main regulator in the U.S.—has signaled its willingness to adopt a more crypto-friendly stance under recently elected President Donald Trump. Issuers have requested to roll out funds tracking the prices of a wide range of cryptos, from meme coins such as Bonk and Dogecoin to larger market-cap assets like XRP and Solana to Official Trump. Bitwise itself is in the process of securing approval for single-asset ETFs that track XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin—tokens that are especially popular with DeFi proponents. Although those altcoins are down from the highs they brushed last January, Hougan believes changing tides in the U.S. regulatory climate could boost DeFi tokens and the projects to which they are linked. “The market hasn’t come to grips with the fact that these tokens could change their tokenomics and be money printing machines in a new regulatory environment,” Hougan said, citing Uniswap, Ondo, and Aave as projects with enormous potential for growth. That new regulatory climate may allow utility tokens with value drivers to thrive, he said, eliminating a major issue in DeFi—the pervasiveness of “squishy governance tokens.” According to Hougan, that potential for growth could render DeFi tokens and other non-blue chip assets well-suited for inclusion in ETF wrappers in the future. Increasing access to crypto-based ETFs Although Bitwise is hardly “throwing spaghetti against the wall” when it picks assets to include in its funds, Hougan noted that Bitwise and other issuers aims to file for new ETFs often. “In ETF land, not in crypto land, this is normal,” Hougan said. “ETF issuers file for a lot of ETFs all the time. Although Hougan declined to specify which assets Bitwise's future funds could track, he said the firm is looking at tokens linked to “high quality” and “interesting” projects with “real potential” to track in single-asset ETFs. The asset manager also listens to its clients when deciding which assets it should offer in ETF wrappers. The firm’s idea, he said, is to give its clients ample options for where to put their money. “I don't want to be paternalistic about what they should access,” Hougan said. The executive said it’s reasonable for issuers to provide clients exposure to all kinds of assets—even those they might not highly recommend—as long as those assets aren’t linked to rug pulls or scams. “Blackrock offers a lot of bond funds, but I wouldn't buy a 30-year Treasury fund if you held a gun to my head,” Hougan said. He added, “I'm not going to tell anyone to invest in Doge, but I could tell someone if you're going to invest in Doge, it's probably cheaper to do in the ETF, and there's probably less risk.” Edited by Sebastian Sinclair Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

March 18, 2025 18:58 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation. If you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now.

Title: MakerDAO’s Spark to invest $500 million in BlackRock’s BUIDL fund

The Tokenization Grand Prix aims to diversify Spark's stablecoin reserves by investing $1 billion in tokenized funds. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spark has announced that BlackRock, Superstate, and Centrifuge are the winners of its Tokenization Grand Prix. The goal is to allocate $1 billion in tokenized assets, with BlackRock’s BUIDL fund set to receive half of it. The competition, launched in July 2024, allocated funds through the Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL). The initiative aimed to integrate real-world assets (RWAs) to diversify Spark’s balance sheet while expanding stablecoin adoption in DeFi. The final allocation remains subject to Sky (formerly MakerDAO) governance approval, with a vote scheduled for April 3. If approved, the initiative will also invest $300 million in Superstate’s USTB and $200 million in Centrifuge-Anemoy Janus Henderson’s JTRSY. Currently, the Spark Liquidity Layer holds USDC, USDS, sUSDS, USDe, and sUSDe. The protocol will use these stablecoins to add BUIDL, USTB, and JTRSY. The competition attracted 39 applications, reviewed by Steakhouse Financial, a firm specializing in RWAs within the Spark ecosystem. Applicants were assessed based on pricing transparency, liquidity levels, and strategic alignment with Spark’s objectives. Spark picked each of these RWA tokens backed by US Treasury securities, suggesting a preference for liquid and conservative assets. BUIDL is offered by BlackRock and tokenized by Securitize. The money fund invests in US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements, and cash. BUIDL is the largest tokenized money fund, with over $1.2 billion in market cap as of March 18. Spark’s incoming investment could propel it close to $2 billion. Meanwhile, Superstate’s USTB focuses on short-duration US Treasury bills maturing in six months or less, ensuring a predictable and secure yield. It is significantly smaller than BUIDL, with $370 million participation in the market. Lastly, Centrifuge-Anemoy Janus Henderson’s JTRSY allocates money to a short-duration US Treasury fund that reinvests in new issuances as existing securities mature. With a market cap of $32.4 million, JTRSY is also the smallest of the three tokenized funds potentially to receive Spark’s investment. If approved, Spark’s investments in BlackRock/Securitize, Superstate, and Centrifuge will mark a significant step in integrating tokenized RWAs into DeFi infrastructure.

Title: AI chips, robots, and reasoning models: 5 takeaways from Nvidia's GTC

Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang shared updates on the chipmaker’s next artificial intelligence chips as part of his announcements at the company’s GPU Technology Conference on Tuesday. Huang also discussed the company’s work on reasoning models, agentic AI, photonics, and robotics at the annual developer conference, also known as the GTC. Here are some takeaways from Huang’s keynote. Huang said Nvidia’s Blackwell chips — which he announced at last year’s GTC — are now in full production. The next Blackwell Ultra NVL72 chips, which have one-and-a-half times more memory and two times more bandwidth, will be used to accelerate building AI agents, physical AI, and reasoning models, Huang said. Blackwell Ultra will be available in the second half of this year. Nvidia’s next-generation GPUs named after astronomer Vera Rubin will be released in the second half of next year, Huang said. Rubin has a new CPU that has twice the performance of its previous chip, as well as more memory and bandwidth. The second half of 2027 will bring Rubin Ultra, Huang said, which will contain multiple GPUs connected together. Huang said Nvidia’s next architecture will be named Feynman, and is coming in 2028. Nvidia Isaac GR00T N1 is the first open and fully customizable AI foundation model for building humanoid robots in the world, Huang said. The company will pre-train GR00T N1 on synthetic and real data, and release the open family of models to robotics developers. Huang unveiled Nvidia Dynamo — “essentially the operating system of an AI factory” — to accelerate and scale reasoning models efficiently. He also announced the Llama Nemotron family of reasoning models which will enable developers and enterprises to build AI agents. The new reasoning models are open. Huang introduced Nvidia DGX personal AI supercomputers, which are powered by the company’s Blackwell AI platform. DGX Station and DGX Spark, formerly known as Project DIGITS, will enable everyone from developers to students to prototype, fine-tune, and run AI models from a personal desktop.

General Motors (GM-0.18%) will rely on Nvidia’s (NVDA+0.78%) artificial intelligence expertise to build its next generation of cars. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the partnership at the company’s annual GTC conference in San Jose, California on Tuesday. “I’m super excited to announce that GM has selected Nvidia to partner with them to build their future self-driving car fleet,” Huang said. GM will use Nvidia’s Drive AGX platform, an in-vehicle computer that delivers “up to 1,000 trillion operations per second of high performance computer,” and includes hardware and software to develop autonomous driving functions as well as immersive in-cabin experiences, according to the press release. The automotive giant will build its next-generation vehicles on the platform, which Nvidia says will speed the development and deployment of safe autonomous vehicles at scale. GM has already been investing in Nvidia graphics processing units for AI model training. As of Tuesday’s announcement, the two companies will expand their partnership to work together to build custom systems to train AI manufacturing models. That also includes optimizing GM’s automotive plant design and operations. To do so, GM will use the Nvidia Omniverse platform to create digital twins of their assembly lines, which will allow for virtual vehicle testing and production simulations. Nvidia will also help GM train robotics platforms already in use for operations, such as precision welding and material handling and transport. “AI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship,” GM chair and CEO Mary Barra said in a press release. “By merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.” GM became the first automaker to offer hands-free driving with the introduction of its Super Cruise advanced driver assistance system in 2017. While the hands-free cars are not completely self-driving cars since the driver might be required to take control if needed, they are a significant step in that direction. Still, the automaker has faced a bumpy road in the world of autonomous driving. In December, the company’s robotaxi service, Cruise, was forced to shut down operations. The decision came on the heels of an external probe into the company for misleading regulators about a 2023 incident in which one of the company’s robotaxis in San Francisco hit a pedestrian. Regardless, the company is optimistic about its path toward delivering safe autonomous vehicles for personal use. “The work we’re doing with companies like Nvidia adds agility to our already highly sophisticated vehicle design, engineering, and manufacturing processes,” GM said in the press release. “By further integrating physical and industrial AI applications (including digital twins, simulation, and robotics) we continue to optimize manufacturing, accelerate virtual testing, and ultimately build smarter, more connected vehicles for our customers.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Hims & Hers stock tumbles as the FDA issues a warning about 'unapproved' weight loss drugs
URL: https://qz.com/hims-hers-stock-falls-fda-compounded-glp-1s-1851770807
Time Published: 2025-03-18T19:34:00Z
Full Content:
Hims & Hers (HIMS-3.64%), the millennial-skewed telehealth company, saw its stock tumble nearly 9% on Tuesday, as the company braces for big regulatory shifts in the weight-loss drug industry. Hims stock took a hit just a day after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated a page on its website outlining its concerns with the use of what it calls “unapproved GLP-1 drugs.” GLP-1 drugs are a class of drugs, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.37%) Ozempic, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. The FDA warned Monday that the use of unapproved versions of these drugs including compounded versions can “be risky for patients, as unapproved versions do not undergo FDA’s review for safety, effectiveness and quality before they are marketed.” Back in May, Hims & Hers started selling compounded semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy — for just $199 a month. That’s a big difference compared to Ozempic’s $1,000 list price and Wegovy’s $1,349 price tag. Compounding means a pharmacy or physician customizes an approved drug to fit an individual patient’s needs. The company’s total sales grew 69% last year to $1.5 billion. Hims & Hers was able to sell this off-brand version because of recent shortages of GLP-1 drugs. Normally, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits making drugs that are just copies of commercially available ones. However, when drugs are in shortage, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t consider them commercially available. Now that the Ozempic shortage is over, Hims & Hers will have to stop selling “essential copies” of compounded semaglutide this year. The FDA said it will start citing companies and healthcare providers that continue to offer “essential copies” of compounded semaglutide starting May 22 or after a judge rules on a lawsuit from the industry group Outsourcing Facilities Association — whichever comes later. “We will have to start notifying customers in the coming month or two that they will need to start looking for alternative options on the commercial dosing,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum told investors during a call in February. Still, Hims & Hers has other avenues to explore. The company could continue to offer more personalized semaglutide formulations and shift its focus to older generic weight-loss drugs. Additionally, on Tuesday Bank of America Securities (BAC+0.89%) analyst Allen Lutz adjusted the firm’s price target for Hims & Hers by $1 to $22 — notably $12 below the stock’s opening price that day. Lutz maintained an “underperform” (sell) rating. Lutz noted that while overall sales grew 124% year over year in February, GLP-1 medications now make up about 45% of the company’s online revenue. Meanwhile, growth outside of GLP-1s has slowed, with core sales increasing just 30% in February — down from 40% in the fourth quarter and 47-50% in the third. “Slowing core growth is an important barometer as semaglutide could exit the model at any time and now represents close to 50% of sales,” Lutz wrote.

March 18, 2025 15:30 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today announced a collaboration with GE HealthCare to advance innovation in autonomous imaging, focused on developing autonomous X-ray technologies and ultrasound applications. Building autonomy into systems like X-ray and ultrasound requires medical imaging systems to understand and operate in the physical world. This enables the automation of complex workflows such as patient placement, image scanning and quality checking. To accomplish this, GE HealthCare, a pioneering partner, is using the new NVIDIA Isaac™ for Healthcare medical device simulation platform, which includes pretrained models and physics-based simulations of sensors, anatomy and environments. The platform accelerates research and development workflows, enabling GE HealthCare to train, test and validate autonomous imaging system capabilities in a virtual environment before deployment in the physical world. “The healthcare industry is one of the most important applications of AI, as the demand for healthcare services far exceeds the supply,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. “We are working with an industry leader, GE HealthCare, to deliver Isaac for Healthcare, three computers to give lifesaving medical devices the ability to act autonomously and extend access to healthcare globally.” Expanding Access to Imaging With Physical AI Ultrasounds and X-ray are the most common and widely used diagnostic imaging systems, yet nearly two-thirds of the global population lack access. Enhancing imaging systems with robotic capabilities will help expand access to care. NVIDIA and GE HealthCare have been working together for nearly two decades, building innovative image-reconstruction techniques across CT and MRI, image-guided therapy and mammography. “GE HealthCare is committed to developing innovative technologies that redefine and enhance patient care,” said Roland Rott, president and CEO of Imaging at GE HealthCare. “We look forward to taking advantage of physical AI for autonomous imaging systems with NVIDIA technology to improve patient access and address the challenges of growing workloads and staffing shortages in healthcare.” Isaac for Healthcare Closes Gap Between Simulation and Reality NVIDIA will also support other customers with Isaac for Healthcare for use cases including simulation environments. Simulation environments enable robotic systems to safely learn skills in a physically accurate virtual environment for real-world situations, such as surgery, that would otherwise be impossible to replicate. Isaac for Healthcare is a physical AI platform built on NVIDIA’s three computers for robotics: NVIDIA DGX™, NVIDIA Omniverse™ and NVIDIA Holoscan. It includes AI models fine-tuned for healthcare robotics that can understand, act and see using enhanced vision and language processing. It also has a simulation framework for developers to accurately simulate medical environments and provides seamless deployment on NVIDIA Holoscan, an edge AI computing platform, to power robotic decision-making in the real world, in real time. Simulation options for medical sensors are often limited. With Isaac for Healthcare, developers can now access physics-based digital twins of medical environments, allowing them to import custom sensors, instruments and even anatomies to teach robots how to respond to various scenarios. These virtual environments help close the gap between simulation and real-world implementation, and enable rapid digital prototyping. Isaac for Healthcare allows for multi-scale simulation ranging from microscopic structures and surgery suites to full hospital facilities. Easy policy training in simulation allows robotic systems to learn how to respond in various medical scenarios in the operating room, and how to best support physician decision-making and patient care.

March 18, 2025 15:13 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC—NVIDIA today announced a major release of new NVIDIA Cosmos™ world foundation models (WFMs), introducing an open and fully customizable reasoning model for physical AI development and giving developers unprecedented control over world generation. NVIDIA is also launching two new blueprints — powered by the NVIDIA Omniverse™ and Cosmos platforms — that provide developers with massive, controllable synthetic data generation engines for post-training robots and autonomous vehicles. Industry leaders including 1X, Agility Robotics, Figure AI, Foretellix, Skild AI and Uber are among the first to adopt Cosmos to generate richer training data for physical AI faster and at scale. “Just as large language models revolutionized generative and agentic AI, Cosmos world foundation models are a breakthrough for physical AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Cosmos introduces an open and fully customizable reasoning model for physical AI and unlocks opportunities for step-function advances in robotics and the physical industries.” Cosmos Transfer for Synthetic Data GenerationCosmos Transfer WFMs ingest structured video inputs such as segmentation maps, depth maps, lidar scans, pose estimation maps and trajectory maps to generate controllable photoreal video outputs. Cosmos Transfer streamlines perception AI training, transforming 3D simulations or ground truth created in Omniverse into photorealistic videos for large-scale, controllable synthetic data generation. Agility Robotics will be an early adopter of Cosmos Transfer and Omniverse for large-scale synthetic data generation to train its robot models. “Cosmos offers us an opportunity to scale our photorealistic training data beyond what we can feasibly collect in the real world,” said Pras Velagapudi, chief technology officer of Agility Robotics. “We’re excited to see what new performance we can unlock with the platform, while making the most use of the physics-based simulation data we already have.” The NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for autonomous vehicle simulation uses Cosmos Transfer to amplify variations of physically based sensor data. With the blueprint, Foretellix can enhance behavioral scenarios by varying conditions like weather and lighting for diverse driving datasets. Parallel Domain is also using the blueprint to apply similar variation to its sensor simulation. The NVIDIA GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation combines Omniverse and Cosmos Transfer to generate diverse datasets at scale, benefiting from OpenUSD-powered simulations and reducing data collection and augmentation time from days to hours. Cosmos Predict for Intelligent World GenerationAnnounced at the CES trade show in January, Cosmos Predict WFMs generate virtual world states from multimodal inputs like text, images and video. New Cosmos Predict models will enable multi-frame generation, predicting intermediate actions or motion trajectories when given start and end input images. Purpose-built for post-training, these models can be customized using NVIDIA’s openly available physical AI dataset. With the inference compute power of NVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72 systems and their large NVIDIA NVLink™ domain, developers can achieve real-time world generation. 1X is using Cosmos Predict and Cosmos Transfer to train its new humanoid robot NEO Gamma. Robot brain developer Skild AI is tapping into Cosmos Transfer to augment synthetic datasets for its robots. Plus, Nexar and Oxa are using Cosmos Predict to advance their autonomous driving systems. Multimodal Reasoning for Physical AI Cosmos Reason is an open, fully customizable WFM with spatiotemporal awareness that uses chain-of-thought reasoning to understand video data and predict the outcomes of interactions — such as a person stepping into a crosswalk or a box falling from a shelf — in natural language. Developers can use Cosmos Reason to improve physical AI data annotation and curation, enhance existing world foundation models or create new vision language action models. They can also post-train it to build high-level planners to tell the physical AI what it needs to do to complete a task. Accelerating Data Curation and Post-Training for Physical AIBased on their downstream task, developers can post-train Cosmos WFMs using native PyTorch scripts or the NVIDIA NeMo™ framework on NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud. Cosmos developers can also use NVIDIA NeMo Curator on DGX Cloud for accelerated data processing and curation. Linker Vision and Milestone Systems are using it for curating large amounts of video data to train large vision language models for visual agents built on the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization. Virtual Incision is exploring it to be deployed in future surgical robots, while Uber and Waabi are advancing autonomous vehicles development. Driving Responsible AI and Content TransparencyIn line with NVIDIA’s trustworthy AI principles, NVIDIA enforces open guardrails across all Cosmos WFMs. In addition, NVIDIA is collaborating with Google DeepMind to integrate SynthID to watermark and help identify AI-generated outputs from the Cosmos WFM NVIDIA NIM™ microservice featured on build.nvidia.com.

March 18, 2025 15:08 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today announced a portfolio of technologies to supercharge humanoid robot development, including NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1, the world’s first open, fully customizable foundation model for generalized humanoid reasoning and skills. The other technologies include simulation frameworks and blueprints such as the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for generating synthetic data, as well as Newton, an open-source physics engine — under development with Google DeepMind and Disney Research — purpose-built for developing robots. Available now, GR00T N1 is the first of a family of fully customizable models that NVIDIA will pretrain and release to worldwide robotics developers — accelerating the transformation of industries challenged by global labor shortages estimated at more than 50 million people. “The age of generalist robotics is here,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1 and new data-generation and robot-learning frameworks, robotics developers everywhere will open the next frontier in the age of AI.” GR00T N1 Advances Humanoid Developer CommunityThe GR00T N1 foundation model features a dual-system architecture, inspired by principles of human cognition. “System 1” is a fast-thinking action model, mirroring human reflexes or intuition. “System 2” is a slow-thinking model for deliberate, methodical decision-making. Powered by a vision language model, System 2 reasons about its environment and the instructions it has received to plan actions. System 1 then translates these plans into precise, continuous robot movements. System 1 is trained on human demonstration data and a massive amount of synthetic data generated by the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform. GR00T N1 can easily generalize across common tasks — such as grasping, moving objects with one or both arms, and transferring items from one arm to another — or perform multistep tasks that require long context and combinations of general skills. These capabilities can be applied across use cases such as material handling, packaging and inspection. Developers and researchers can post-train GR00T N1 with real or synthetic data for their specific humanoid robot or task. In his GTC keynote, Huang demonstrated 1X’s humanoid robot autonomously performing domestic tidying tasks using a post-trained policy built on GR00T N1. The robot’s autonomous capabilities are the result of an AI training collaboration between 1X and NVIDIA. “The future of humanoids is about adaptability and learning,” said Bernt Børnich, CEO of 1X Technologies. “NVIDIA’s GR00T N1 model provides a major breakthrough for robot reasoning and skills. With a minimal amount of post-training data, we were able to fully deploy on NEO Gamma — furthering our mission of creating robots that are not tools, but companions that can assist humans in meaningful, immeasurable ways.” Among the additional leading humanoid developers worldwide with early access to GR00T N1 are Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Mentee Robotics and NEURA Robotics. NVIDIA, Google DeepMind and Disney Research Focus on PhysicsNVIDIA announced a collaboration with Google DeepMind and Disney Research to develop Newton, an open-source physics engine that lets robots learn how to handle complex tasks with greater precision. Built on the NVIDIA Warp framework, Newton will be optimized for robot learning and compatible with simulation frameworks such as Google DeepMind’s MuJoCo and NVIDIA Isaac™ Lab. Additionally, the three companies plan to enable Newton to use Disney’s physics engine. Google DeepMind and NVIDIA are collaborating to develop MuJoCo-Warp, which is expected to accelerate robotics machine learning workloads by more than 70x and will be available to developers through Google DeepMind’s MJX open-source library, as well as through Newton. Disney Research will be one of the first to use Newton to advance its robotic character platform that powers next-generation entertainment robots, such as the expressive Star Wars-inspired BDX droids that joined Huang on stage during his GTC keynote. “The BDX droids are just the beginning. We’re committed to bringing more characters to life in ways the world hasn't seen before, and this collaboration with Disney Research, NVIDIA and Google DeepMind is a key part of that vision,” said Kyle Laughlin, senior vice president at Walt Disney Imagineering Research & Development. “This collaboration will allow us to create a new generation of robotic characters that are more expressive and engaging than ever before — and connect with our guests in ways that only Disney can.” NVIDIA and Disney Research, along with Intrinsic, announced an additional collaboration to build OpenUSD pipelines and best practices for robotics data workflows. More Data to Advance Robotics Post-TrainingLarge, diverse, high-quality datasets are critical for robot development but costly to capture. For humanoids, real-world human demonstration data is limited by a person’s 24-hour day. Announced today, the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation helps address this challenge. Built on Omniverse and NVIDIA Cosmos Transfer world foundation models, the blueprint lets developers generate exponentially large amounts of synthetic motion data for manipulation tasks from a small number of human demonstrations. Using the first components available for the blueprint, NVIDIA generated 780,000 synthetic trajectories — the equivalent of 6,500 hours, or nine continuous months, of human demonstration data — in just 11 hours. Then, combining the synthetic data with real data, NVIDIA improved GR00T N1’s performance by 40%, compared with using only real data. To further equip the developer community with valuable training data, NVIDIA is releasing the GR00T N1 dataset as part of a larger open-source physical AI dataset — also announced at GTC and now available on Hugging Face. AvailabilityNVIDIA GR00T N1 training data and task evaluation scenarios are now available for download from Hugging Face and GitHub. The NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation is also now available as an interactive demo on build.nvidia.com or to download from GitHub. The NVIDIA DGX Spark personal AI supercomputer, also announced today at GTC, provides developers a turnkey system to expand GR00T N1’s capabilities for new robots, tasks and environments without extensive custom programming. The Newton physics engine is expected to be available later this year.

German equities closed higher on Tuesday, lifting European markets in general after the parliament approved plans for a large spending surge, while investors awaited details from a call between US and Russian leaders with a potential Ukraine peace deal on the line. The blue-chip index closed up 1 per cent after hitting an intraday record high. The domestically-exposed small-cap index climbed 3 per cent to a more than three-year high, while mid-caps were up 1.6 per cent. Germany’s Bundestag approved the reforms that include a major rollback of the so-called debt brake to increase defence spending, and a €500 billion fund for infrastructure. They will be presented to the upper house on Friday. The optimism around the reforms has resulted in a rally in defence stocks, the euro and euro zone yields in recent weeks, although they all pared gains after the vote. “It’s probably been a case of buy the rumour and sell the facts, where the German market has done so much better than everything else. There’s a little bit of profit taking,” said Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter. Dublin Ires Reit fell 0.9 per cent after the State’s largest private residential landlord said it had refinanced its existing €500 million revolving credit facility in a deal that will leave its annual interest rate at 3.8 per cent, unchanged from 2024. AIB and Bank of Ireland trended up – by 1.4 per cent and 1 per cent respectively – along with many of Europe’s financials. Glanbia in contrast was down again, closing the session at €10.40. The Kilkenny-based food giant, which has a large US operation, has been struggling since an earnings downgrade last month. Home builder Glenveagh was up again – rising by 1.6 per cent – following on from last week’s positive results. Europe The pan-European Stoxx 600 gained 0.6 per cent with European banks leading gains, up 2.5 per cent. The banks index touched its highest level since February 2011, on higher spending prospects. Energy and automobile and parts shares followed, with most sectors ending the day in the green, as the European benchmark index outperformed Wall Street. Investors also awaited details from a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin as the U.S. attempts to convince Moscow to accept a ceasefire in its war with Ukraine. Computacenter jumped 11 per cent after the technology and services provider said it was well placed for progress in 2025, with a strong order backlog across all regions. Bollore lost 5.4 per cent after the French conglomerate reported full-year results. Siemens gained 1.2 per cent after the engineering company said it would cut 5,600 jobs from its flagship digital industries business. London The FTSE 100 rose on Tuesday while US stocks slipped, as markets looked ahead to interest rate calls from both countries’ central banks later in the week. The Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve are poised to announce their latest decisions on interest rates, with traders expecting both to hold rates at their current levels. In the UK, policymakers have been gradually cutting borrowing costs since August last year, easing pressure on some borrowers who have seen lower mortgage rates enter the market. But the bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, has stressed a “gradual and careful approach” to reducing rates. London’s blue-chip index rose 25 points to finish the day at 8,705, a 0.3 per cent rise. In company news, Close Brothers said it swung to a loss after setting aside £165 million (€196 million) in provisions for the motor finance commission scandal. Shares in the company slumped by 21.8 per cent after it posted a statutory pretax loss of £103.8 million for the six months to January 31, against profits of £87 million a year ago. New York Wall Street’s main indexes were lower on Tuesday on worries about the economic impact of US tariff policies ahead of a monetary policy decision from the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s two-day rate-setting meeting kicks off on Tuesday, and expectations are that the central bank will keep interest rates steady, according to data compiled by LSEG. Several US central bank officials have cautioned against hasty moves and said they would wait for data to see the impact of tariffs before making any policy shifts. “I don’t think they (Fed) know exactly how this (trade policy) is going to play out,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. Markets were taking a pause after all three major indexes gained more than 2 per cent each over the past two sessions as investors capitalised on discounted US equities following last week’s sell-off. The S&P 500 had tumbled more than 10 per cent from its February peak, signsignalling benchmark index entered a correction phase. The blue-chip Dow is trading close to correction levels, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq confirmed it is in a correction on March 6th. In company news, Alphabet fell 3 per cent after the company said it would buy Wiz for about $32 billion (€29 billion) in its biggest deal as the Google parent doubles down on cybersecurity. Nvidia declined 2.3 per cent. The company is expected to reveal details of its latest AI chip at its annual software developer conference. Tesla fell 4.2 per cent after brokerage RBC trimmed its price target on the EV maker’s stock, flagging the company is losing market share in China and Europe.

Investors have met Google's $32 billion acquisition of cloud security startup Wiz with a collective yawn. Shares of parent-company Alphabet dropped as much as 5% on Tuesday following the deal announcement. The deal is seen as an attempt by Google to close the gap between itself and mega-cap cloud competitors like Amazon and Microsoft. But rather than react to a potentially transformative deal, investors elected to focus on economic-slowdown fears. These concerns stem largely from President Donald Trump's ongoing trade war, with uncertainty around tariffs clouding forecasts for corporate activity and economic expansion. Rumblings of a possible recession have gotten louder, leading to risk-off sentiment that recently pushed the benchmark S&P 500 into correction territory. Alphabet's share decline comes alongside a sell-off for the so-called Magnificent Seven. Tesla fell 5% to pace the group's losses, while Meta fell 4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.8%. Investors will be watching the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting to determine how the central bank feels about the state of the economy. Virtually no investors expect an interest-rate cut at this meeting, though this could become a possibility down the road if the economic stimulus is needed. Jump to

March 18, 2025 14:17 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today unveiled NVIDIA Dynamo, an open-source inference software for accelerating and scaling AI reasoning models in AI factories at the lowest cost and with the highest efficiency. Efficiently orchestrating and coordinating AI inference requests across a large fleet of GPUs is crucial to ensuring that AI factories run at the lowest possible cost to maximize token revenue generation. As AI reasoning goes mainstream, every AI model will generate tens of thousands of tokens used to “think” with every prompt. Increasing inference performance while continually lowering the cost of inference accelerates growth and boosts revenue opportunities for service providers. NVIDIA Dynamo, the successor to NVIDIA Triton Inference Server™, is new AI inference-serving software designed to maximize token revenue generation for AI factories deploying reasoning AI models. It orchestrates and accelerates inference communication across thousands of GPUs, and uses disaggregated serving to separate the processing and generation phases of large language models (LLMs) on different GPUs. This allows each phase to be optimized independently for its specific needs and ensures maximum GPU resource utilization. “Industries around the world are training AI models to think and learn in different ways, making them more sophisticated over time,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “To enable a future of custom reasoning AI, NVIDIA Dynamo helps serve these models at scale, driving cost savings and efficiencies across AI factories.” Using the same number of GPUs, Dynamo doubles the performance and revenue of AI factories serving Llama models on today’s NVIDIA Hopper™ platform. When running the DeepSeek-R1 model on a large cluster of GB200 NVL72 racks, NVIDIA Dynamo’s intelligent inference optimizations also boost the number of tokens generated by over 30x per GPU. To achieve these inference performance improvements, NVIDIA Dynamo incorporates features that enable it to increase throughput and reduce costs. It can dynamically add, remove and reallocate GPUs in response to fluctuating request volumes and types, as well as pinpoint specific GPUs in large clusters that can minimize response computations and route queries. It can also offload inference data to more affordable memory and storage devices and quickly retrieve them when needed, minimizing inference costs. NVIDIA Dynamo is fully open source and supports PyTorch, SGLang, NVIDIA TensorRT™-LLM and vLLM to allow enterprises, startups and researchers to develop and optimize ways to serve AI models across disaggregated inference. It will enable users to accelerate the adoption of AI inference, including at AWS, Cohere, CoreWeave, Dell, Fireworks, Google Cloud, Lambda, Meta, Microsoft Azure, Nebius, NetApp, OCI, Perplexity, Together AI and VAST. Inference Supercharged NVIDIA Dynamo maps the knowledge that inference systems hold in memory from serving prior requests — known as KV cache — across potentially thousands of GPUs. It then routes new inference requests to the GPUs that have the best knowledge match, avoiding costly recomputations and freeing up GPUs to respond to new incoming requests. “To handle hundreds of millions of requests monthly, we rely on NVIDIA GPUs and inference software to deliver the performance, reliability and scale our business and users demand,” said Denis Yarats, chief technology officer of Perplexity AI. “We look forward to leveraging Dynamo, with its enhanced distributed serving capabilities, to drive even more inference-serving efficiencies and meet the compute demands of new AI reasoning models.” Agentic AI AI provider Cohere is planning to power agentic AI capabilities in its Command series of models using NVIDIA Dynamo. “Scaling advanced AI models requires sophisticated multi-GPU scheduling, seamless coordination and low-latency communication libraries that transfer reasoning contexts seamlessly across memory and storage,” said Saurabh Baji, senior vice president of engineering at Cohere. “We expect NVIDIA Dynamo will help us deliver a premier user experience to our enterprise customers.” Disaggregated ServingThe NVIDIA Dynamo inference platform also supports disaggregated serving, which assigns the different computational phases of LLMs — including building an understanding of the user query and then generating the best response — to different GPUs. This approach is ideal for reasoning models like the new NVIDIA Llama Nemotron model family, which uses advanced inference techniques for improved contextual understanding and response generation. Disaggregated serving allows each phase to be fine-tuned and resourced independently, improving throughput and delivering faster responses to users. Together AI, the AI Acceleration Cloud, is looking to integrate its proprietary Together Inference Engine with NVIDIA Dynamo to enable seamless scaling of inference workloads across GPU nodes. This also lets Together AI dynamically address traffic bottlenecks at various stages of the model pipeline. “Scaling reasoning models cost effectively requires new advanced inference techniques, including disaggregated serving and context-aware routing,” said Ce Zhang, chief technology officer of Together AI. “Together AI provides industry-leading performance using our proprietary inference engine. The openness and modularity of NVIDIA Dynamo will allow us to seamlessly plug its components into our engine to serve more requests while optimizing resource utilization — maximizing our accelerated computing investment. We’re excited to leverage the platform’s breakthrough capabilities to cost-effectively bring open-source reasoning models to our users.” NVIDIA Dynamo Unpacked NVIDIA Dynamo includes four key innovations that reduce inference serving costs and improve user experience: NVIDIA Dynamo will be made available in NVIDIA NIM™ microservices and supported in a future release by the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform with production-grade security, support and stability.

Next-generation wireless networks must be fundamentally integrated with AI to seamlessly connect hundreds of billions of phones, sensors, cameras, robots and autonomous vehicles. AI-native wireless networks will provide enhanced services for billions of users and set new standards in spectral efficiency — the rate at which data can be transmitted over a given bandwidth. They will also offer groundbreaking performance and resource utilization while creating new revenue streams for telecommunications companies. “Next-generation wireless networks will be revolutionary, and we have an unprecedented opportunity to ensure AI is woven in from the start,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Working with leaders in the field, we’re building an AI-enhanced 6G network that achieves extreme spectral efficiency.” Open Ecosystems Drive Innovation Research-driven breakthroughs harnessing the power of AI are necessary to maximize the performance and benefits of AI-native wireless networks. To drive innovation, NVIDIA is collaborating with telco and research leaders to develop an AI-native wireless network stack based on the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform, which provides software-defined radio access networks (RANs) on the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. Developers across the globe are building AI-RAN as a precursor to AI-native 6G wireless networks. AI-RAN is a technology that brings AI and RAN workloads together on one platform and embeds AI into radio signal processing. To deliver enhanced spectral efficiency and lower operational complexity and costs, AI will be fully embedded into the network stack’s software and hosted over a unified accelerated infrastructure, capable of running both network and AI workloads. Also at the solution’s core will be end-to-end security and an open architecture to foster rapid innovation. T-Mobile and NVIDIA will expand their AI-RAN Innovation Center collaboration announced last year with the goal of providing additional research-based concepts for AI-native 6G network capabilities, working alongside these new industry collaborators. “This is an exciting next step to the AI-RAN Innovation Center efforts we began last September at our Capital Markets Day in partnership with NVIDIA,” Mike Sievert, CEO of T-Mobile. “Working with these additional industry leaders on research to natively integrate AI into the network as we begin the journey to 6G will enable the network performance, efficiency and scale to power the next generation of experiences that customers and businesses expect.” As the founding research partner, MITRE, a not-for-profit research and development organization, will research, prototype and contribute open, AI-driven services and applications, such as for agentic network orchestration and security, dynamic spectrum sharing and 6G-integrated sensing and communications. “MITRE is working with NVIDIA to help make AI-native 6G a reality,” said Mark Peters, president and CEO of MITRE. “By integrating AI into 6G in the beginning, we can solve a wide range of problems, from enhancing service delivery to unlocking required spectrum availability to fuel wireless growth. Through all of our collaborations with NVIDIA, we look forward to creating impact in 6G, AI, simulation, transportation and more.” Cisco plans to take a lead position in this collaboration as the provider of mobile core and network technologies and will tap into its existing service provider reach and expertise. “With 6G on the horizon, it’s critical for the industry to work together to build AI-native networks for the future,” said Chuck Robbins, chair and CEO of Cisco. “Cisco is at the forefront of developing secure infrastructure technology for AI, and we are proud to work with NVIDIA and the broader ecosystem to create an AI-enhanced network that improves performance, reliability and security for our customers.” ODC, a portfolio company of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., will deliver cutting-edge layer 2 and layer 3 software for distributed and centralized units of virtual RAN as part of the AI-native radio access stack. Tapping into decades of experience in large-scale mobile systems, ODC is pioneering next-generation AI-native 5G open RAN (ORAN), surpassing existing networks and seamlessly paving the way for 6G evolution. “The mobile industry has always taken advantage of advances in other technology fields, and today, no technology is more central than AI,” said Shaygan Kheradpir, chairman of the advisory board of ODC. “ODC is at the forefront of developing and deploying AI-native ORAN 2.0 networks, enabling service providers to on-ramp seamlessly from 5G to 6G by taking advantage of the vast AI ecosystem to redefine the future of connectivity.” As a leader in AI and cybersecurity to the federal government, Booz Allen will develop AI RAN algorithms and secure the AI-native 6G wireless platform. Its NextG lab will conduct functional, performance integration and security testing to ensure the resiliency and security of the platform against the most sophisticated adversaries. The company will lead field trials for advanced use cases such as autonomy and robotics. “The future of wireless communications starts today, and it’s all about AI,” said Horacio Rozanski, chairman and CEO of Booz Allen. “Booz Allen has the technologies to make AI-native 6G networks a reality and revolutionize secure communications for an entirely new generation of intelligent platforms and applications.” Expanded Aerial Research PortfolioThese collaborations build on NVIDIA’s AI-RAN and 6G research ecosystem, supported by advancements in the NVIDIA Aerial™ research portfolio for developing, training, simulating and deploying groundbreaking AI-native wireless innovations. New additions to the NVIDIA Aerial Research portfolio, also announced today, include the Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin Service, the Aerial Commercial Test Bed on NVIDIA MGX™, NVIDIA Sionna™ 1.0 — building on the open-source Sionna library, which has nearly 150,000 downloads since its launch in 2022 — and the Sionna Research Kit on the NVIDIA Jetson™ accelerated computing platform. The NVIDIA Aerial Research portfolio serves over 2,000 members through the NVIDIA 6G Developer Program. Industry leaders and more than 150 higher-education and research institutions from the U.S. and around the world are harnessing the platform to accelerate 6G and AI-RAN innovation — paving the way for AI-native wireless networks.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.

Update: March 18, 2:37 p.m. ET: Huang announced the Vera Rubin GPU, which has twice the performance of its Grace chips with more memory and bandwidth. Rubin is expected in the second half of next year. Huang said the following Rubin Ultra is slated for the second half of 2027. Update: March 18, 2:35 p.m. ET: Huang says Blackwell Ultra NVL72 is coming in the second half of the year. Earlier in his keynote, Huang said Blackwell is in full production. Blackwell Ultra has one-and-a-half times more memory and more bandwidth. Update: March 18, 2:16 p.m. ET: Huang announced Nvidia Dynamo — “essentially the operating system of an AI factory” — for the future of AI agents. All eyes will be on Nvidia (NVDA+0.78%) chief executive Jensen Huang today as he shares more about the chipmaker’s next artificial intelligence chips. In February, Huang said he would discuss the chipmaker’s Blackwell Ultra AI chip, next-generation Vera Rubin platform, and plans for following products at the annual GPU Technology Conference, also known as the GTC. Huang said the company has “some really exciting things to share” at the developer conference about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. The chipmaker introduced its highly anticipated Blackwell AI platform at last year’s GTC, which has “successfully ramped up” large-scale production, and made “billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Huang said on the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. Analysts at Bank of America (BAC+0.89%) said in a note last week that they “expect Nvidia to present attractive albeit well-expected updates on Blackwell Ultra,” with a focus on inferencing for reasoning models, which major firms such as OpenAI and Google are racing to develop. The analysts are also anticipating more information on Nvidia’s next-generation networking technology, and what the chipmaker’s long-term opportunities are in autonomous cars, physical AI such as robotics, and quantum computing. Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said Nvidia is likely to talk more about its Project DIGITS personal AI supercomputer at the GTC, in comments shared with Quartz. “I’ve been saying for years that Nvidia GPU systems are ‘like the iPhone cycle, but better,’” Cook said. “What I mean is that enterprises will pay for the latest, better, and faster from Jensen, but they can still use their old hardware, too, because it’s all integrated and updated by CUDA software.” Cook said he thinks DIGITS will give smaller developers the ability to build their own physical AI models and agentic AI applications. Follow along for live updates as Huang’s keynote begins at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET) and runs for approximately two hours. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Wiretap: CISA Staff Are Cautiously Optimistic About Trump’s Pick For Director

ByThomas Brewster ByThomas Brewster , Forbes Staff. The Wiretap is your weekly digest of cybersecurity, internet privacy and surveillance news. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here. President Trump has chosen the new head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Sean Plankey will take the helm, having previously served in the last Trump administration as director of cyber policy at the National Security Council, security positions at the Energy Department and Cyber Command and chief information officer for the Navy. Three employees inside the agency told Forbes they were cautiously optimistic about the new CISA director, who will be looking to steady a ship rocked by swift layoffs that hit a number of key projects, from securing elections to protecting AI systems from cyberattack. Over recent weeks, CISA employees, all speaking on the condition of anonymity, had told Forbes morale was low and concerns were high that important work was being hampered by the cuts. Two staffers and a recently-departed employee pointed to the Secure By Design initiative, which had major tech companies like Amazon and Google agree to implement procedures to ensure security in their products before they’re released to the public. While it remains active, a number of those who led the project have departed, leading to concerns that it is now understaffed, two insiders said. AI and open source security work has also been hit, as Wired recently reported. Plankey will be replacing the interim chief Bridget Bean over the coming weeks, should he pass through Senate confirmation, and two staffers said they’re happy someone with a long history in security is taking over. That Plankey is largely “non-controversial” and has worked across both the Pentagon and DHS should stand him in good stead, said one staffer. “I think most people are optimistic that we got a serious person with experience,” they added. The new director has yet to meet CISA staff. For now, one staffer said programs are getting ready to pitch themselves to Plankey to make sure they survive an “impending reorganization.” Many remain unsure how severe the downsizing will be, another said, only that it is coming this year. Meanwhile, after a restraining order was put on the Trump administration’s firings, CISA is having to re-hire any probationary staff laid off after January 20.

In some astonishing allegations filed in a northern California court this week, workforce management provider Rippling accused rival Deel of a corporate espionage campaign. The former alleged that the latter co-opted a Rippling employee to spy on its comms channels to look out for signs of customers switching away from Deel. The suit claims that Rippling set a trap to catch the rogue employee, saying it sent a letter detailing a Slack channel of interest to specific Deel execs. Within hours the suspected insider was searching for the make-believe channel. Deel has denied all wrongdoing. Apple has challenged a U.K. order that it open up a backdoor into users’ encrypted iCloud backups, but had to do so in a closed-door meeting at the U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Tribunal. American lawmakers have raised concerns about the secretive, privacy-invading move. A sonic weapon was allegedly used against Serbian protesters over the weekend, as footage showed crowds fleeing what sounded like a low-flying jet. The government has denied any such anti-protest weaponry was deployed. Such tools have been used to deter demonstrations for years and the best known devices are the Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRADs), which are manufactured by Genasys. From March 28, Amazon is taking away Alexa users’ ability to prevent voice recordings being sent off to the tech giant’s servers. The reason? It needs to train its Alexa AI, reports Ars Technica. Google announced the acquisition of cloud cybersecurity provider Wiz in a $32 billion deal. A previous attempt to buy the company at $23 billion faltered last year. It’s Google’s biggest acquisition ever by quite a lot– the second largest was its purchase of Motorola for $12.5 billion in 2011. Rostislav Panev, a 51-year-old Russian and Israeli dual national, has been extradited from Israel to the U.S. to face charges he helped develop the LockBit ransomware. Per a Department of Justice release, “Panev and his LockBit coconspirators grew LockBit into what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world. The LockBit group attacked more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries around the world, including 1,800 in the United States.”

March 18, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 14, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022, to February 3, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR MERCK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 30, 2024, Merck released its second quarter 2024 financial report and disclosed a significant reduction in Gardasil vaccinations, resulting in an overabundance of inventory at Merck’s Chinese distributor. The Company announced that its shipments of Gardasil to China may fall below contracted levels for 2024. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $12.53, or 9.8%, to close at $115.25 per share on July 30, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 4, 2025, Merck disclosed that it would entirely cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory,” citing a continued over-inflation of channel inventories as demand in China had “not recovered to the level [the Company] had expected.” Merck also announced that it would no longer achieve its long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Merck securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 14, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

All eyes will be on Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) chief executive Jensen Huang today as he shares more about the chipmaker’s next artificial intelligence chips. In February, Huang said he would discuss the chipmaker’s Blackwell Ultra AI chip, next-generation Vera Rubin platform, and plans for following products at the annual GPU Technology Conference, also known as the GTC. Huang said the company has “some really exciting things to share” at the developer conference about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. The chipmaker introduced its highly anticipated Blackwell AI platform at last year’s GTC, which has “successfully ramped up” large-scale production, and made “billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Huang said on the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. Jefferies (JEF-0.51%) analysts said in a note last week that they expect Nvidia’s product announcements at the GTC “to be another positive catalyst” for the company “as investors move past supply-chain noise and can once again get excited about the technology roadmap.” Meanwhile, analysts at Bank of America (BAC+0.76%) said in a note last week that they “expect Nvidia to present attractive albeit well-expected updates on Blackwell Ultra,” with a focus on inferencing for reasoning models, which major firms such as OpenAI and Google are racing to develop. Bank of America analysts are also anticipating more information on Nvidia’s next-generation networking technology, and what the chipmaker’s long-term opportunities are in autonomous cars, physical AI such as robotics, and quantum computing. Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said Nvidia is likely to talk more about its Project DIGITS personal AI supercomputer at the GTC, in comments shared with Quartz. “I’ve been saying for years that Nvidia GPU systems are ‘like the iPhone cycle, but better,’” Cook said. “What I mean is that enterprises will pay for the latest, better, and faster from Jensen, but they can still use their old hardware, too, because it’s all integrated and updated by CUDA software.” Cook said he thinks DIGITS will give smaller developers the ability to build their own physical AI models and agentic AI applications. “With the introduction of DIGITS, we have another Apple (AAPL-1.13%) moment for Nvidia as they have created a personal tool that costs less than 5% of the price of the newest Blackwell GPUs, and every developer and startup founder will want one for their desk or home system,” Cook said.

Title: Streaming Viewers Are Willing to Accept Ads, But Not If They're Paying for it, Tubi Finds
URL: https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=168149
Time Published: 2025-03-18T13:53:43Z
Full Content:
As more and more streamers pile into advertising-led subscription services there are signs of a potential backlash among consumers with nearly 80% agreeing that if they’re paying for a streaming service, they expect no ads at all. That’s according to a new survey by Tubi, which also found that nearly half of Gen Z viewers found ads that seem misaligned with their own preferences to “significantly disrupt” their enjoyment of the streaming experience. Worth noting upfront that Tubi’s research, conducted as it is with The Harris Poll, is self-serving. The Fox-owned streamer, which claims more than 97 million monthly active users mostly in the U.S, is a largely free ad supported service. Nonetheless, the warning is there for streamers like Netflix or Amazon Prime as they ramp up ads and charge $6.99 and $8.99 a month for the basic with-ads service respectively. For instance, 81% of consumers told Tubi that watching ads is a fair trade-off for access to free streaming content and encouragingly for ad buyers 59% of viewers say they'd consider taking action after seeing interesting ads while streaming. This figure leaps up to 81% among Gen Z but there’s a catch: most ads miss the mark. 73% of Gen Z viewers though the ads they see when streaming “seem misaligned with my personal preferences.? This highlights a major missed opportunity for brands to create more relevant, impactful advertising. “Overwhelmingly, consumers see paid platforms with ads as a bad deal,” the report states. “Let’s face it, ads can feel disruptive, but they’ll be a more welcome interruption if they are relevant to the viewer and serve as a fair trade-off for free content.” The survey also reinforced the budget concerns of a subscription saturated target audience. Streaming is a sizable chunk of consumers' monthly entertainment budget – On average, consumers are spending $129 per month on streaming + cable which is $20 more than they spend on clothes each month $109. 56% of consumers say they monitor streaming services carefully, so as to not overspend, and Gen Z viewers are particularly cost-sensitive: 76% say they have or would end their streaming subscription over increased price. On average, viewers are juggling nearly 7 streaming services, with a mix of paid streaming services (3.9 on average) and free services (2.6 on average). Other frustrations that cause subscription switch-offs: removal of content (66% agree), irrelevant content (63% agree), tiered memberships (63% agree) and password crackdowns (45%, up 5% YoY). Two-thirds (67%) of Gen Z watchers have ended a streaming subscription because they finished watching the show or movie they were interested in – and there was no other relevant programming on the platform for them. A significant portion of Gen Z are looking to downsize their streaming use: 29% say they use more services now than they plan to in the future. It also found that password sharing is becoming a tricky social dilemma. Seven in 10 viewers told the survey that they wouldn't share their streaming login with a romantic partner unless they were seriously dating. “Why? Because like a toothbrush, once it's shared, there's no going back,” the report states. 44% of Gen Z admit that they've continued using an ex's streaming platform login even after they broke up. The unspoken rules of password sharing haven't got easier. More than half (53%) of Gen Z viewers think that password sharing has made relationships with family & friends more complicated, and 38% confess that they've stopped dating someone because their taste in TV / movies was so different. Tubi's conclusion: “Perhaps the era of the password pass around is over with viewers opting to keep their streaming relationships strictly professional.” In terms of content, Tubi found viewers favoring indies over remakes. 70% of US streamers want to see more TV shows & movies on platforms that are independent or from smaller creators (a 4% increase YoY). 73% of Gen Z says they prefer to watch original content over franchises/remakes; and 72% of Gen Z streamers wish they had more of a say in the type of content that gets made for streaming services. Tubi, the free streaming service owned by Fox, flew under the radar for years, but now the industry has taken note of its surging popularity. At NAB New York, Peter Kafka, Business Insider's chief correspondent about the TV/streaming landscape, talked with Tubi CEO Anjali Sud about the TV/streaming landscape and how her company is changing the ways that people watch. In the pursuit of catalyzing profit, large video streaming companies have been radically altering their approach to growing top-line revenue and curtailing costs for some time now, be it through layoffs, password-sharing crackdowns, licensing of catalog content to rival streamers, and, notably, the introduction of advertising tiers.

Better-than-expected economic numbers weren’t enough to buoy stocks, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones indexes all opening lower. Industrial production picked up in February, rising an above-estimate 0.7% from January, when it’d expanded a revised 0.3%. Manufacturing output and capacity utilization also improved by more than expected. Housing starts picked up in February by more than expected to an annualized pace of 1.50 million from a downwardly revised 1.35 million January. Building permits were little changed at a 1.46 million rate. The import and export price indexes both slowed by less than expected last month. Here are some stocks in focus today: Google (GOOGL-0.97%) parent Alphabet’s stock fell 0.7% after Bloomberg reported that the company is in fresh talks to buy cloud-security provider Wiz for about $33 billion, after extended discussions on a potential deal were called off last summer. Wiz is a privately held company. Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) CEO Jensen Huang will give the keynote address Tuesday at his company’s AI developers conference in San Jose, California. Investors will be listening closely for any hints about future plans or demand for the company’s products. He’s due to start speaking at 1 p.m. E.T. today. Nvidia stock fell 2.6% ahead of the speech. Tencent Music’s (TME-3.64%) ADRs jumped 10% after the Chinese online entertainment company’s fourth-quarter earnings topped expectations. The company’s Super Premium VIP membership gained traction among users, Reuters reported. Tesla’s (TSLA-1.28%) stock slipped about 5.6% in early trading after its Chinese rival BYD (BYDDY-0.58%) said Monday that it had developed an ultra-fast charger able to refill a battery in five minutes. BYD’s ADRs climbed 2.2% after its Hong Kong-listed shares closed 4.1% higher. Xiaomi’s (XIACF-3.01%) ADRs rose 5% in New York trading after the maker of mobile phones and electric vehicles boosted its EV-delivery target for 2025 to 350,000 vehicles and reported 90% surge in quarterly net profit and a 49% jump in sales. Xpeng’s (XPEV-7.21%) U.S.-listed shares fell 10% after it posted earnings. The EV maker’s quarterly net loss narrowed by more than expected and revenue was in line with expectations, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Title: Amazon Layoffs: AI likely to claim 14,000 corporate jobs by early this year as firm eyes cost cuts

Amazon Layoffs: E-commerce major Amazon Inc. is set to lay off 14,000 managerial jobs by early 2025 as the trillion-dollar company aims to cut costs. While this may not be a fresh round of firing, it may be recalled that back in September 2024 Amazon's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Andy Jassy announced his plans to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15 per cent by the end of March 2025. A message from CEO Andy Jassy to the employees dated 16 September 2024 noted that he feels that the company can have a better organizational structure to drive the level of ownership and speed it desires. "We want more of our teammates feeling like they can move fast without unnecessary processes, meetings, mechanisms, and layers that create overhead and waste valuable time," Andy said. LiveMint has reached out to Amazon for an official comment to get an update on any recent changes to this decision. "We’re asking each s-team (senior-team) organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025. Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day," he added. Speaking on the issue of improving efficiency, Andy batted for returning to work from office. "To address the second issue of being better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business, we’ve decided that we’re going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID. When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant," the CEO's message read, adding that “having the right culture at Amazon is something I don’t take for granted.” Reportedly, the company seeks to save between ₹210 crore and ₹360 crore annually after the said workforce reduction. These managerial job cuts will bring down the number of managers in the firm to 91,936 managers, compared to the current level of 1,05,770 managers. As of 2024, 15.5 lakh employees work at Amazon, compared to its previous levels of nearly 15.3 lakh employees, according to Business Insider.

Title: Meet Jensen Huang, Nvidia's founder and CEO
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/jensen-huang
Time Published: 2025-03-18T04:30:01Z
Full Content:
The AI arms race has been good business for Nvidia, which supplies the highly in-demand chips used by many Big Tech giants and startups alike to train AI models. That's also been good news for Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. In 2024, he shot into Forbes' list of the world's 10 wealthiest people as business boomed for Nvidia. Huang and fellow Nvidia founders Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky planted the seed for Nvidia at a Denny's in northern California in 1993. Today, it's a household name in the AI industry, and Huang is the billionaire businessman leading it. Here's a look at Jensen Huang's career rise and background. Huang was born in Taiwan in 1963. He spent some of his childhood there and in Thailand before his parents sent Huang and his brother to the US to live with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington. His uncle sent him to Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky but after Huang's parents immigrated to the US, the family lived in Oregon. He graduated from high school at age 16 before going to college. Huang got his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University. Huang got his first job at 15. He washed dishes and bussed and waited tables at a Denny's in Portland. Before founding Nvidia, Huang worked at computer chip manufacturer LSI Logic from 1985 to 1993 and at semiconductor company AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, from 1984 to 1985. At a Denny's in 1993, Huang and his Nvidia co-founders, Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, came up with the idea that would eventually lead to Nvidia's creation. In 1999, the company released the GeForce 256, which it called the first graphics processing unit, or GPU. Today, Nvidia is instrumental in the generative AI industry, supplying the coveted chips that tech companies use to train AI models. Interest in Nvidia's chips amid the AI boom has pushed the company to new heights. In one notable milestone, Nvidia's market cap passed $3 trillion in 2024 to briefly overtake Apple as the world's most valuable company. Huang's net worth is $105.4 billion, according to Forbes. Huang's management and leadership style sees him skipping 1-on-1 meetings, managing around 60 direct reports as CEO, giving feedback publicly, and sending his staff hundreds of emails a day. Current and former Nvidia employees previously told BI that Huang is a hands-on boss with high expectations and meticulous attention to detail who values owning up to your mistakes. Huang has said he has workaholic tendencies, logging 14-hour days and working on holidays. He has a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his shoulder, which he agreed to get when the company's stock price hit $100 per share. Huang's black leather jacket has also become a famous part of his wardrobe — a staple piece he often wears when giving keynotes or showing off a new product. Nvidia's other founders, meanwhile, have stayed further out of the spotlight than Huang. Priem was Nvidia's chief technical officer from 1993 to 2003, and Malachowsky is a senior technology executive at Nvidia. After Nvidia went public in 1999, Priem put more than three-quarters of his Nvidia shares into his Priem Family Foundation and by 2006, he'd sold the rest of his shares. He was left with a fortune of roughly $30 million, Forbes estimated in 2023. Huang met his now-wife, Lori, while still attending Oregon State University. The couple share two children: Madison Huang is a director of product and technical marketing at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang is a product line manager at the company. Huang and Lisa Su, CEO of Nvidia's rival chip giant AMD, are distant cousins. He has a home in Silicon Valley, as Nvidia is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Huang has been president, CEO, and a member of Nvidia's board of directors since the company's creation. He and Nvidia haven't said much about succession planning. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2024 and has received the Semiconductor Industry Association's highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award. In past years, The Economist has named Huang the world's best CEO, Fortune has dubbed him its Businessperson of the Year, and TIME has included him in its yearly list of the world's 100 most influential people. As of March 2024, Huang owned roughly 3.79% of the company's outstanding shares, according to a proxy statement. He is Nvidia's largest individual shareholder. Jump to

March 17, 2025 19:43 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

March 17, 2025 18:49 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, March 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP) securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. AppLovin Corporation engages in building a software-based platform for advertisers to enhance the marketing and monetization of their content in the United States and internationally. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that AppLovin (APP) Misled Investors Regarding its Profitability According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The complaint alleges that while defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors, they were concealing material adverse facts related to AppLovin’s manipulative practices to force unwanted apps on customers using a “backdoor installation scheme,” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn its profitability. Plaintiff alleges that the truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. On this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025, to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against AppLovin Corporation. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must file their papers with the court by May 5, 2025.

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Liquid Mercury, a renowned provider of professional crypto trading and digital asset marketplaces, has announced a strategic partnership with dVIN Labs to launch an investment-grade wine trading platform collaboratively. The partnership will see Liquid Mercury provide a mechanism capable of powering the global order book for trading tokenized wine on the dVIN Protocol. With its design, the dVIN protocol seeks to leverage a combination of data, DePIN, DeFi, and tokenization to bring wine on-chain. Notably, dVIN’s mission to revolutionize the wine industry with blockchain-powered transparency and unified liquidity aligns greatly with Liquid Mercury’s decision to debut wine as an investment and tradable asset to millions of new investors. dVIN is a great fit for this partnership because it can solve the authenticity, verification, and provenance challenges that have relegated wine investment to an inefficient, niche activity that appeals to the well-connected uber-wealthy. David Garrett, co-founder and co-CEO of dVIN, commented on the partnership, saying, “The $300 billion investment-grade wine market is ready to be exposed to new investors and to become a liquid, tradable asset.” “Our goal is to make investing in wine as easy and efficient as investing in your favorite stock, cryptocurrency, or other favorite asset. We chose Liquid Mercury as our partner to create a liquid, global marketplace because our expertise in the wine market is matched by their team’s expertise in financial markets, laying the groundwork to unlock this exciting new digital asset class,” he added. The partnership will see Liquid Mercury, and dVIN join efforts to release a platform that will unify previously fragmented liquidity and turn investment-grade wine into a scalable asset class with democratized tools and access for retail investors and institutions alike. Furthermore, Liquid Mercury will provide white-labeled platforms for dVIN channel partners to onboard individual investors. These investors can gain instant access to wine from their favorite winemakers and exclusive wines held at bonded warehouses around the world. Also, Liquid Mercury will provide support for the dVIN global order book, which aggregates regional marketplaces and utilizes trading technology purpose-built to get the best price for buyers and sellers. Liquid Mercury CEO Tony Saliba also commented on the development saying; “Liquid Mercury is thrilled to partner with dVIN to unlock wine as an investment and tradable asset to millions of new investors…Our thesis for real-world assets has been that investing in culture is a powerful secular trend, and we know our battle-tested technology can reliably power new digital marketplaces, so we see massive potential in this partnership.”

Title: How Trump and Musk built their own reality

The presidents of the United States have gotten lost in the illusions they created. by Elizabeth Lopatto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The presidents of the United States have gotten lost in the illusions they created. by Elizabeth Lopatto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The putative president of the United States, Donald Trump, stood on the White House lawn. In his hand, he held a sales pitch for Tesla cars. The most powerful man in America, Elon Musk, attired for a very casual funeral and looking miserable, stood next to Trump. As Trump spoke, promising to buy a Tesla, Musk stood with his arms folded over his chest, giving the undeniable impression of a sulking toddler. Later, Trump threatened to label anyone vandalizing Teslas or Tesla dealerships domestic terrorists. The entire incident was, in its way, revelatory. A series of protests had targeted Tesla dealerships and owners, as Americans expressed their distaste for Musk, the unelected leader of the US. The instinct, in response to real behavior, was to create a media moment: a Tesla ad. One of the bizarre hallmarks of the Trump era is a set of elected officials who increasingly cannot tell apart spectacle and reality — as well as a group of voters who seem similarly confused. Take the Trump voter insisting that government agencies get tax cuts for DEI initiatives, as a baffled Sam Seder attempts to explain that, in fact, government agencies are what taxes are for, and thus are not taxed themselves. It seems the conservative mind cannot comprehend that DEI is, in fact, actually popular. To avoid acknowledging that, the voter summoned up a conspiracy theory that flies in the basic facts of governance, which he either does not know or does not care about. Confronted with a choice between a truth he doesn’t like and a fantasy, he has chosen the fantasy. The break with reality has been a long time coming — QAnon and Pizzagate preceded it — but in the pre-pandemic era, it was largely the fringes of the conservative movement. Now it is the main event. Faced with the horrors of mass death in 2020, a great many people have since apparently chosen to make a break with reality. That is now the basis of the conservative movement, as Mark Zuckerberg tacitly acknowledged when he abandoned fact-checking on Meta platforms. Requiring Trump supporters to stick to truth on social media would mean they could not post. And what has replaced truth? Spectacle. The proclivity for spectacle is the thing Musk and Trump truly have in common, though the media they target is different: Musk is an online guy, and Trump was forged in reality TV. Trump’s media instincts hew closer to professional wrestling — he has hosted two WrestleManias — and he appears to approach his cabinet as a kind of casting for Fox News. Is noted drunkard Pete Hegseth good at his job? Who cares, he looks good on television. Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, originated on The Real World, after all. Musk has similarly created an online profile of himself, largely as a marketing gimmick for Tesla. (Hey, did you hear that Robert Downey Jr modeled his portrayal of Tony Stark on Elon Musk?) In less dire times, he posted about mixing wine and Ambien as readily as he did about SpaceX missions — creating a fandom in the process. He is optimized for the attention economy; Musk may be outrageous, he may be insulting, he may be juvenile, but he is not boring. I am one of many journalists who had to follow his entire charade of taking Tesla private — which played out on Twitter, rather than in any boardroom. The spectacle works because pseudo-events are more exciting than reality; a normal budgetary meeting is a snooze, and normal diplomatic relations rely on closed doors, occurring out of sight of the average voter. Reality TV doesn’t work on this level — and keeping the viewers hooked is the main source of Trump’s and Musk’s respective power. The question is how long the spell will last. Is it possible for reality to be more interesting than the spectacle? Is there a point at which the horrors stop being entertainment? One of the basic problems of the modern world, and of mass media, is that most news events occur at a distance to a normal person and appear only through representation. The Tesla protests, for example, occur on TV or on TikTok for most people, side by side with fiction, and given equal epistemic weight. TV news itself allowed its seriousness to erode beginning in the 1970s, chasing ratings through entertainment. The main innovation of Fox News, besides its propagandistic tendencies, was Roger Ailes’ focus on making sure the channel was titillating rather than useful. (Ailes’ formula included a “leg cam” and plenty of blondes.) Fox News — the “news” part is best thought of as a dark joke — is a ratings bonanza because its primary focus is entertainment. The formula is adapted for television but is roughly the same as that detailed by David Foster Wallace’s 2005 profile of right-wing talk radio “Host”: keep the audience enraged, keep the audience engaged. This runs parallel to reality TV, which is not especially reality-based. Trump jumped to Fox News from The Apprentice and WWE with his instincts for keeping an audience fully formed. His first term was marked by a preoccupation with ratings — not approval, but television. Trump has long had a propensity to call into his favorite Fox News shows to ramble away — and his schedule during his first term was crammed full of “executive time,” which one might presume was his TV habit. “This is going to be great television.” This focus on TV hasn’t changed. Trump’s disastrous meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ended with Trump telling Zelenskyy, “This is going to be great television.” Great television, of course, is not the same as great statecraft, and as a result of the meeting, European leaders pledged support for Ukraine. Trump is obsessed with invading Canada, and it appears to be because he doesn’t like seeing a wayward line on a map. This saber-rattling has got our mild-mannered northern neighbors boycotting US products. The maker of Jack Daniel’s says that Canada pulling US alcohol from store shelves to express their displeasure is “worse than tariffs.” Previous US leaders — starting with President John F. Kennedy — have also skillfully commanded television as a medium to suit their political ends. But those leaders seemed aware of the distinction between television and reality. For Trump, reality is whatever he says it is, which is then broadcast by Fox News back to him to confirm its truth. In his last term, even as Trump himself was sickened by the novel coronavirus, he insisted the pandemic was no big deal. After being taken by helicopter to a hospital, he made a series of public appearances where he was obviously ill and pretending not to be. Almost 400,000 people died from covid that year, according to death certificate information compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This may be the only way of explaining the bizarre economic policy coming from the White House. I don’t think Trump understands money — he’s filed for bankruptcy six times, hardly the sign of a successful businessman. But thanks to The Apprentice, he knows how to play a successful businessman on TV — by appearing domineering and decisive. The economy, however, occurs in reality rather than on TV, and in just 20 days of Trump’s flailing, the stock market has gone from all-time highs to an atmosphere of pure fear. The tariff threats, which Trump thinks make him sound powerful, are part of the problem, alienating trading partners and jacking up the price of ordinary goods. So, too, are Musk’s random firings of government workers under the guise of “efficiency.” Federal spending cuts also threaten everyone from farmers to retirees. Four airlines have cut their forecasts because they fear consumer confidence is waning. Sure, some of the economy — the stock market in particular, about which, more in a minute — can be shaped by narrative. The problem is a conflict of interest: the things that Trump thinks make him look strong to his voters also make the business community skittish. Consider his tariffs. They target some of America’s biggest imports and stand to make it harder to get your car repaired, assuming you can buy one at all. If the stock market continues to plunge, it’ll hit baby boomers squarely in their retirement savings, which will mean less spending overall. So, Trump is destroying the economy so he can look and feel tough — the sign of a man who’s confused about the difference between television and reality. His main source of funding, Musk, who has signaled he wants to buy more influence, is similarly confused. Musk’s problem isn’t TV, though. It’s the internet. Musk spent the last 10 years or so as the internet’s premier financial influencer, memeing Tesla’s stock to a bizarrely high price-earnings ratio through his Twitter antics. (Indeed, the platform was so important to him that he eventually bought it.) And while he has enough sense of reality to ransack the federal government in order to benefit SpaceX, meet with foreign leaders, and cut oversight of his companies, he is also striking poses for the benefit of X. Take, for instance, telling the foreign minister of Poland, “Be quiet, small man” on X. Poland has been paying for Starlink terminals used in Ukraine and has threatened to find another provider. As Trump and Musk blunder around the EU, alienating allies in order to cozy up to Russia, Musk’s Twitter fingers escalate the sense of panic. Not exactly what you want when the EU is considering rearming itself. Musk’s power is very real. He has control of the US Treasury — because while the courts have repeatedly ruled against him, those court orders need to be enforced to matter, and on several occasions, Musk and his goons have reportedly “vetoed” payments Trump has ordered. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts happen at his whim. That means that Republican officials call Musk directly to grovel. But they also publicly perform for Musk on X. Take Ed Martin, the US attorney, who has promised an X account claiming to be DOGE-affiliated that he will take action on “doxing.” Or Oklahoma senator James Lankford publicly begging for his pet ammunition plant to be spared DOGE cuts. Even the mothers of Musk’s children resort to X performances to get his attention. Even the mothers of Musk’s children resort to X performances to contact him Rather than attempting to reassert their constitutional power and decapitate DOGE, Republicans have chosen to abase themselves. “What we got to do as Republicans is capture their work product, put it in a bill and vote on it,” said Lindsey Graham, the senator from North Carolina, according to CNN. He is the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, which, before Musk, was actually a fairly powerful position. Now it seems his job is to rubber-stamp Musk’s decisions. Musk’s key obsession appears to be “wokeness,” a smokescreen for dismantling the Civil Rights Movement. The weird conspiracy theories Musk is ingesting on X are guiding his cuts in the government, which have been haphazard and have, at times, resulted in the rehiring of fired employees after officials belatedly realized they were crucial. The cuts, which have not delivered Musk’s promised cost savings, have been justified through lies Musk and DOGE have promoted, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency housing migrants in luxury hotels. Musk is not so far gone that he can’t raid the government to suit himself. Appealing to the Trump base gives him cover to target agencies that will benefit him directly, such as NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Musk is effectively trying to create his own political reality, using X as a staging ground. The more noxious and viral the claims, the more useful they are to Musk. He is also attempting to destroy anything that might contract his constructed reality — which explains his war on Wikipedia. Wikipedia, a largely volunteer-run nonprofit, is a remarkably accurate encyclopedia — at least as accurate as the Encyclopedia Britannica, and maybe more so. It is a reference source available to anyone. And Musk loathes it. As long as it remains, anyone can check what he says and discover when he is wrong. He has hated that for a very long time. Despite Musk’s increasingly batshit public performance, which now includes a gesture that looks suspiciously like a Nazi salute, Republicans are too scared to criticize him. They know Musk can fund a primary challenge against them without breaking a sweat. So they’re stuck with Musk, who has been posting increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories to his X account. When X went down earlier this week, Musk claimed with no evidence that Ukraine was behind the company’s outage. Instead, hacking collective Dark Storm has taken credit for the disruption. Once upon a time, this all served a business purpose Musk has a long history of manipulating attention online — well before his chainsaw antics at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), his jumping jack at a Trump rally, or the alleged Sieg Heil. Twitter, when it was still called that, was how he created a fan base that hung on his every word. For at least the last decade, he’s been creating a reality-distortion field. Sometime around 2018 — I’d pinpoint it at his “pedo guy” defamation trial — Musk stopped being able to distinguish between his performances and reality. As this happened, the amount of time he spent posting on Twitter started to climb. Once upon a time, there was a business purpose: Twitter meant he didn’t have to do traditional advertising for Tesla; eventually, he built a profile big enough that he could just show up on TV shows like Saturday Night Live, while his competitors had to buy ads. But it seems Musk has become increasingly isolated, since his fame has made it difficult to appear in public. That means Twitter, now X, has been his main social outlet for some time, and it appears to have seriously warped him. At CPAC, when Musk, apparently zooted, mumbled something about “I am become meme,” he really, really meant it. It is, at times, difficult to know if Musk can distinguish fantasy from reality. Twitter is a far more poisoned well than cable news, and as Musk’s use has increased, his public statements have gotten increasingly weird. Musk has repeatedly suggested that Fort Knox’s gold is gone — never mind that in the last Trump administration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited the gold. Is this just red meat to the base? Does Musk want an excuse to be let into Fort Knox, to visit or even pocket the gold? Or did he read something on the darker recesses of Twitter and take it as truth? Musk has also claimed that there is wild fraud in Social Security, targeting it for the latest round of DOGE cuts. Musk has said that Social Security is “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” which will doubtless be news to the many retirees who rely on it. Looks like Musk is attempting to create the conditions that would allow him to slash Social Security by inventing fraud wholesale. But it is possible, I suppose, that he is so brainrotted he really believes what he’s saying. The White House is currently claiming that Musk’s intent to meddle with Social Security won’t affect payments. We’ll see. The guy who’s posting memes calling people who receive it “the parasite class” doesn’t seem like he’s a careful steward of the program. And stiffing Social Security beneficiaries could add to Trump’s economic woes — as, once again, retirees cut spending. TV and X reproduce events that happen at a distance, which makes it easier for distortions to take hold. If someone tells me it is raining while I am standing in the sun, I know I am being lied to. But if someone tells me that the gold in Fort Knox has been stolen, I cannot check that directly. I have to trust intermediaries — the soldiers who guard the gold, the Treasury auditors who annually count it. As trust in institutions has been eroded, partly through the institutions’ own mistakes, conspiracy theories have run wild. Conspiracy theories are usually more entertaining than reality — a secret gold heist is so sensational that multiple movies have been made about it — but they also flatter the conspiracist, who now has secret knowledge. The flattering part, the secret knowledge, is what allows conspiracy theorists to continue to believe lies even in the face of actual, verifiable events. I’m not convinced Trump and Musk are tracking reality anymore, in part because, in reality, they look pretty ugly. Better to imagine themselves as their fans do: bold heroes, fighting for America — rather than gross authoritarians ransacking the country for personal benefit. As for their supporters, the erratic behavior, tariffs, abrupt firings, and tensions with Canada have some Michigan swing voters expressing reservations. These people are at least aware of economic reality. But right now, true believers in DOGE and Trump feel they are part of a community that is “saving” the US from, uhhhh, woke? Usually, lie-based belief systems are fragile — it’s hard to make the initial dent in the worldview, but once it happens, the whole thing shatters. The attacks on Tesla threaten Trump and Musk, and might be enough to shake some of their followers loose. They are also, and this is important, entertaining in a way that works against the pair. It is funny to listen to Cybertruck owners whine. It is even funnier to see the Cybertruck get stuck or have parts fall off. Tesla’s plunging stock price threatens Musk’s reputation and spending power Tesla’s plunging stock price threatens Musk’s business reputation — particularly since he’s supposedly the company’s CEO and yet is spending all of his time in the White House, securing fun new payouts for SpaceX. It also threatens his spending power, since most of Musk’s net worth is tied up in Tesla stock. Worse, a lot of that stock is pledged as collateral for loans. As of a 2024 SEC filing, about a third of Musk’s Tesla shares were pledged. If Tesla’s share price falls low enough, Musk has to pony up more shares or pay back some of his loans, which leaves him with less spending money for Trump and the Republicans. That loosens some of his grip on power. No wonder he’s panicking. The little demonstration on the White House lawn shows how much power Musk still has over Trump — because if Trump wanted to apply pressure to Musk, he wouldn’t make a public show of support. You can see, if you squint, what’s happening. Trump and Musk are trying to reframe the protest against Tesla dealerships (and indeed, Teslas themselves) as the “woke mob” — substituting into the roles that “antifa” and “Black Lives Matter” played in Trump’s last presidency. Footage of people protesting Tesla and leaving bags of dog shit on Cybertrucks can create a new enemy for Musk and Trump’s enemies to hate, letting them dodge anger for their actions that harm the economy and Social Security. The question is whether it’ll work. Cuts to Social Security and Medicaid have the potential to be dangerous to Musk — and therefore also to Trump. Both programs are popular, even with Republicans. Musk says he’s going to cut $700 billion, which may mean putting up new hurdles for people to receive their benefits — requiring more paperwork, say. Or it may mean cutting payments to doctors, hospitals, and nursing homes. Either way, it’ll hit people who rely on both programs pretty quickly, as they are increasingly unable to access care. And it’s hard to blame that on former President Joe Biden when Musk is out here already taking credit for it. If grandma suddenly can’t see her doctor, we all know who’s to blame — Elon Musk, and the guy who put him in office, Donald Trump. I’m not sure any amount of “woke mob” posturing can undo that.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles.

Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time.

In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Title: Amazon plans to lay off 14,000 managerial positions to save $3.5B yearly
URL: https://techstartups.com/2025/03/17/amazon-to-lay-off-14000-managerial-positions-to-save-3-5-billion-annually/
Time Published: 2025-03-17T21:50:22Z
Full Content:
Amazon is set to cut around 14,000 managerial positions by early 2025, aiming to save between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion annually. This reduction marks a 13% drop in Amazon’s global management workforce, shrinking the number of managers from 105,770 to 91,936. This move follows recent layoffs in Amazon’s communications and sustainability units, as the company pushes to streamline operations and restructure teams. According to Business Insider, the job cut is part of CEO Andy Jassy’s strategy to simplify decision-making and speed up processes. Last month, Jassy announced plans to boost the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. He emphasized that reducing managerial layers would streamline operations and enable Amazon to make faster decisions without getting bogged down by bureaucracy. In a note released Thursday, Morgan Stanley projected that Amazon’s plan could cut around 13,834 managerial roles by early next year, saving the company between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion. The estimate is based on the assumption that managers make up 7% of Amazon’s workforce. “Morgan Stanley estimated that this effort could lead to the elimination of roughly 13,834 manager roles by early next year, resulting in cost savings of $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion,” Business Insider reported. As part of this plan, Amazon has launched a “bureaucracy tipline,” encouraging employees to flag inefficient procedures that slow down work. Managers have also been instructed to increase their direct reports, limit senior hires, and review pay structures to support the shift toward a leaner management model. This layoff wave continues Amazon’s cost-cutting efforts that saw over 27,000 job cuts in 2022 and 2023. The company has also pulled back on projects that didn’t yield profits, including its “Try Before You Buy” clothing initiative and a speedy brick-and-mortar delivery service. Amazon’s workforce saw significant growth during the pandemic, swelling to over 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in late 2019. Although numbers have dipped since then, the company is still recalibrating its staffing needs. Earlier this year, Amazon mandated that corporate employees return to the office five days a week. Some staff were asked to relocate to designated office hubs, prompting some to leave rather than move. Management restructuring is another key part of Jassy’s approach, with efforts to reduce layers between employees and leadership. This move places Amazon alongside other tech companies trimming their workforce. Layoffs.FYI, a site tracking job cuts in tech, reports that 81 tech companies have eliminated 22,692 jobs so far this year.

Title: Nvidia's stock slips ahead of Jensen Huang's GTC keynote

Time Published: 2025-03-17T20:36:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia’s (NVDA+0.78%) stock was down by 1.76% at the market close on Monday ahead of chief executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at the GPU Technology Conference. The chipmaker’s shares closed at $119.53 each and are down 11% so far this year. During after-hours trading, the stock was slightly down by around 0.1%. All eyes will be on Huang’s keynote on Tuesday at the chipmaker’s annual developer conference, also known as the GTC, where he is expected to unveil its next artificial intelligence chips. In February, Huang said he will share more about the company’s Blackwell Ultra AI chip, next-generation AI platform Vera Rubin, and other product plans at the conference. Nvidia has “some really exciting things to share” at the GTC about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics, Huang said during the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. Last week, analysts at Bank of America (BAC+0.89%) said in a note that they “expect Nvidia to present attractive albeit well-expected updates on Blackwell Ultra” at the GTC. The analysts added that they anticipate Nvidia will focus on inferencing for reasoning models, which major firms such as OpenAI and Google are racing to develop. Jefferies (JEF-0.23%) analysts said in a note on Monday that they expect “the noise around CPO [co-packaged optics] to resurface over next few weeks” going into the GTC and the optical conference. Nvidia will likely discuss how the optical technology will be used in AI data centers, the analysts said. Meanwhile, some quantum computing stocks climbed on Monday ahead of the GTC’s first “Quantum Day” that will be held on Thursday. Quantum Computing (QUBT-13.98%) stock closed up by 13.12%, while D-Wave was up by 10.15% at the market close. Executives from quantum companies, including D-Wave, are expected to join Huang to discuss “what businesses should expect from quantum computing in the coming decades — mapping the path toward useful quantum applications,” Nvidia said. Shares of IonQ (IONQ-8.98%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI-10.90%), both of which are also expected to join Huang at the GTC, were down by 0.28% and 0.53% respectively at the close.

Title: Klarna, nearing IPO, plucks lucrative Walmart fintech partnership from rival Affirm
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/klarna-nearing-ipo-plucks-lucrative-walmart-fintech-partnership-rival-rcna196764
Time Published: 2025-03-17T18:44:39Z
Full Content:
Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Swedish fintech firm Klarna will be the exclusive provider of buy now, pay later loans for Walmart, taking a coveted partnership away from rival Affirm, CNBC has learned. Klarna, which just disclosed its intention to go public in the U.S., will provide loans to Walmart customers in stores and online through the retailer’s majority-owned fintech startup OnePay, according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the partnership. OnePay, which updated its brand name from One this month, will handle the user experience via its app, while Klarna will make underwriting decisions for loans ranging from three months to 36 months in length, and with annual interest rates from 10% to 36%, said the people. The new product will be launched in the coming weeks and will be scaled to all Walmart channels by the holiday season, likely leaving it the retailer’s only buy now, pay later option by year-end. The move heightens the rivalry between Affirm and Klarna, two of the world’s biggest BNPL players, just as Klarna is set to go public. Although both companies claim to offer a better alternative for borrowers than credit cards, Affirm is more U.S.-centric and has been public since 2021, while Klarna’s network is more global. Shares of Affirm fell 13% in morning trading Monday. The deal comes at an opportune time for Klarna as it readies one of the year’s most highly anticipated initial public offerings. After a dearth of big tech listings in the U.S. since 2021, the Klarna IPO will be a key test for the industry. The firm’s private market valuation has been a roller coaster: It soared to $46 billion in 2021, then crashed by 85% the next year amid the broader decline of high-flying fintech firms. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has worked to improve Klarna’s prospects, including touting its use of generative artificial intelligence to slash expenses and headcount. The company returned to profitability in 2023, and its valuation is now roughly $15 billion, according to analysts, nearly matching the public market value of Affirm. The OnePay deal is a “game changer” for Klarna, Siemiatkowski said in a release confirming the pact. “Millions of people in the U.S. shop at Walmart every day — and now they can shop smarter with OnePay installment loans powered by Klarna,” he said. “We look forward to helping redefine checkout at the world’s largest retailer — both online and in stores.” As part of the deal, OnePay can take a position in Klarna. In its F-1 filing, Klarna said it entered into a “commercial agreement with a global partner” in which it is giving warrants to purchase more than 15 million shares for an average price of $34 each. OnePay is the partner, people with knowledge of the deal confirmed. For Affirm, the move is likely to be seen as a blow at a time when tech stocks are particularly vulnerable. Run by CEO Max Levchin, a PayPal co-founder, the company’s stock has surged and fallen since its 2021 IPO. The lender’s shares have dipped 18% this year before Monday. Affirm executives frequently mention their partnerships with big merchants as a key driver of purchase volumes and customer acquisition. In November, Affirm’s chief revenue officer, Wayne Pommen, referred to Walmart and other tie-ups including those with Amazon, Shopify and Target as its “crown jewel partnerships.” An Affirm spokesman had this statement: “We win business when merchants want superior performance and maximum value, given our underwriting and capital markets advantages. We will continue our long-term strategy of competing on our products and entering into sustainable partnerships.” The deal is no less consequential to Walmart’s OnePay, which has surged to a $2.5 billion pre-money valuation just two years after rolling out a suite of products to its customers. The startup now has more than 3 million active customers and is generating revenue at an annual run rate of more than $200 million. As part of its push to penetrate areas adjacent to its core business, Walmart executives have touted OnePay’s potential to become a one-stop shop for Americans underserved by traditional banks. Walmart is the world’s largest retailer and says it has 255 million weekly customers, giving the startup — which is a separate company backed by Walmart and Ribbit Capital — a key advantage in acquiring new customers. Last year, the Walmart-backed fintech began offering BNPL loans in the aisles and on checkout pages of Walmart, CNBC reported at the time. That led to speculation that it would ultimately displace Affirm, which had been the exclusive provider for BNPL loans for Walmart since 2019. OnePay’s move to partner with Klarna rather than going it alone shows the company saw an advantage in going with a seasoned, at-scale provider versus using its own solution. OnePay’s push into consumer lending is expected to accelerate its conversion of Walmart customers into fintech app users. Cash-strapped consumers are increasingly relying on loans to meet their needs, and the installment loan is seen as a wedge to also offer users the banking, savings and payments features that OnePay has already built. Americans held a record $1.21 trillion in credit card debt in the fourth quarter of last year, about $441 billion higher than balances in 2021, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data. “It’s never been more important to give consumers simple and convenient ways to access fair credit at the point of sale,” said OnePay CEO Omer Ismail. “That’s especially true for the millions of people who turn to Walmart every week for everything.” Next up is likely a OnePay-branded credit card offered with the help of a new banking partner after Walmart successfully exited its partnership with Capital One. “We’re looking forward to going down this new path where not only can they provide installment credit ... but also revolving credit,” Walmart CFO John David Rainey told investors in June. — CNBC’s MacKenzie Sigalos and Melissa Repko contributed to this report. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.

Title: Intel rockets 8% on talk of new CEO's AI chip strategy

Intel’s (INTC-0.94%) next chief executive isn’t formally due for work until Tuesday, but there’s already talk of an artificial intelligence-strategy revamp under Lip-Bu Tan. Investors sent the stock soaring on Monday after a Reuters report on the incoming CEO’s revitalization plans, which include pushing Intel into territory dominated by rivals Nvidia (NVDA+0.78%) and ARM (ARM+1.05%). Intel stock jumped more than 8% to about $26 at 1:25 p.m. in New York. The rise over the past week has all but offset its loss in the market correction, and it’s now up almost 29% so far this year. Nvidia, which soared with the AI hype cycle, is down about 14% from January 1. In addition to boosting sales for Intel’s foundry business, which makes chips designed by other firms, Tan intends to make chips for AI servers, foundation models, and robotics, Reuters (TRI-0.59%) said, citing people familiar with the subject. Intel had neglected those markets, allowing ARM to rise in smartphone chips and Nvidia to dominate in AI. Last week, Tan told attendees of a company town hall that “tough decisions” were needed to revive Intel, possibly including further job cuts targeting middle managers. The company eliminated about 15,000 positions last year. An Intel spokesperson declined to comment on the story to Quartz. Tan will join Intel after running Cadence (CDNS-0.48%), which makes product-design software and hardware, for more than a decade. He was also a founding partner at VC firm Walden and sits on the boards of Credo Technology Group (CRDO-1.20%) and Schneider Electric.

Title: The cost of GLP-1s needs to come way down for benefits to be worth it, study says
URL: https://qz.com/glp-1s-wegovy-zepbound-study-health-benefits-cost-1851770425
Time Published: 2025-03-17T17:21:54Z
Full Content:
While weight-loss drugs like Zepbound (LLY+0.48%) and Wegovy (NVO-0.37%) offer significant health benefits, their high costs make them economically inefficient under current U.S. healthcare standards, according to a new study published Friday in JAMA Health Forum. Researchers analyzed national survey data to assess the long-term impact of four anti-obesity medications, including tirzepatide and semaglutide — the active ingredients in Zepbound and Wegovy, respectively. They found that these drugs could help prevent obesity-related complications such as heart disease and diabetes. However, their high price tags — $12,648 per year for tirzepatide and $13,618 per year for semaglutide — exceed the typical cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000 to $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). QALY is a standard benchmark in healthcare used to evaluate whether a medical treatment provides good value for its cost, essentially how much a healthcare system or insurance provider is generally willing to pay for each additional QALY or year of perfect health gained under a treatment. In the U.S., treatments are generally considered cost-effective if they fall below the $100,000–$150,000 per QALY range. To meet that threshold, the study found, tirzepatide’s price would need to drop by 30.5%, while semaglutide would require an 81.9% reduction. “Efforts to reduce the net prices of new anti-obesity medications are essential to ensure equitable access to highly effective anti-obesity medications,” the study authors wrote. The findings come as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) moves forward with efforts to lower drug costs. Earlier this year, CMS announced it had selected 15 additional drugs for its second round of price negotiations, including Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy. The new lower Medicare prices are set to take effect in 2027. For their part Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly — the maker of Zepbound — have both launched direct-to-consumer pharmacies that offer the drugs at lower prices for patients that pay without insurance.

Title: You can't split a payment on Airbnb directly — here's what you can do instead

Up until 2018, Airbnb offered a feature that was a favorite among users: split rental fees. With a few extra clicks of your mouse or taps on your phone, you could invite everyone staying at a rental to pay their share of the fee and avoid those awkward conversations about who owed who how much cash or who already sent money through Venmo. However, you can no longer split payments on Airbnb. So, if you want to split the cost of an Airbnb rental, you have to do it the old-fashioned way — with a few exceptions. The simplest way to split the cost of an Airbnb is for one person to handle the entire payment via the Airbnb site or app and then have everyone else pay their fair share through Venmo, PayPal, CashApp, Apple Pay, or any other preferred payment app. Most rentals will also allow you to pay a down payment when booking and then pay the rest in installments, giving you time to collect payments from everyone else staying at the Airbnb. If you choose to pay in installments, you can use a different credit card for each payment, which may be a good option if there are just two of you splitting the bill. If you're renting a long-term Airbnb, you also have the option of using a different payment method for each recurring monthly charge. If you're the one to lay down your credit card, you can also collect a large number of points, especially if you use a travel credit card. Unfortunately, Airbnb doesn't make it easy to split payments for a reservation if you're traveling with a group. Your best option is for one person to pay and then use an electronic payment service like Venmo, PayPal, CashApp, or Apple Pay to collect reimbursements from the other travelers.

Title: Five reasons to expect a US equity recovery

Time Published: 2025-03-17T13:21:54Z

It appears US equities are getting caught up between Sino-US geopolitical tensions. Ironically, it is the under owned stocks in export sensitive economies, like China and the EU, that have prospered on expectations of greater fiscal spending brought about by Trump’s ‘America First’ agenda. On the US side, it seems that Trump’s trade protectionism agenda has backfired. The mighty US tech sector has seemingly lost its sheen, and the risk of a US recession has increased. The Atlanta Fed’s early read on real GDP for the first quarter of 2025 estimates a contraction of 2.4% at an annualised rate, the biggest decline since the pandemic-led lockdown. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Much of that decline comes from imports brought forward ahead of expected US tariff increases, which led to a large drag on GDP. It is not yet clear if this is just a temporary stalling in growth or something more significant. Final sales to domestic producers, a more specific measure of domestic private consumer demand that excludes exports, is still growing at a 0.8% rate, which is probably a better read of the health of the underlying economy. Trump may be placing greater importance on keeping the cost of government borrowing down at the expense of the equity market. That’s because Trump’s party, the Republicans, will be asking Congress over the coming months to raise the debt ceiling limit by over $4trn as part of a comprehensive legislative package to deliver on his domestic priorities. Trump will want to show that the US public debt market is stable ahead of a likely “Birthday Summit” with President Xi in June when both presidents celebrate their birthdays. Trump will want the Chinese to commit to buy more US Treasuries at that meeting. Furthermore, in an interview on Fox News on March 10, Trump appeared to talk down long-term interest rates by saying the US economy is experiencing a “period of transition”. That’s because he wants a weaker US dollar to support the competitiveness of US manufacturing. Indeed, Trump made this point in a speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4 when he said, “We need a weaker dollar to bring back our manufacturing jobs. A strong dollar makes it difficult for our companies to compete globally”. Trump is also using the war in Ukraine, and the threat of removing financial and military support, as leverage to get European nations to step-up fiscal spending on defence and ideally, US military hardware. Following the recent German election, there is a desire from the leadership of the new incoming government to raise fiscal spending by reforming the so-called “debt brake” – a mechanism to ensure budget deficits are kept down on a structural basis. This includes more German public expenditure on infrastructure and an open-ended commitment to raise defence procurement. Essentially, this expansionary fiscal policy could narrow the US-European growth gap and give impetus for the euro to appreciate against the dollar. On the China side, Beijing is using a subtle response to Trump’s trade tariffs. President Xi’s recent meeting with Jack Ma, the co-founder of tech giant Alibaba, was choreographed to show the Tech sector has implicit approval from the Chinese political leadership. In addition, the release of DeepSeek (an AI model by a Chinese startup) in January did not help the US tech sector either. DeepSeek raises questions on whether US companies should be spending so much money on computing hardware. China is using its “soft power” to weaken US dominance in financial markets and its economy down a notch to strengthen the country’s negotiation hand ahead of an inevitable President Trump-Xi summit to discuss trade and investment. Arguably, the key takeaway for investors from recent Sino-US geopolitical tensions is that the US dollar has depreciated. This adds support for US stocks in several ways. First, they become cheaper for non-US investors. Second, fundamentally, a weaker US dollar should boost US multinationals’ profits from overseas when translated back home. And third, dollar weakness indicates that there is a greater supply of the currency than demand. Potentially, this creates favourable financial conditions for equities to recover from oversold levels should money flows back to risky assets. The recent US equity price falls mean valuations for the so-called US ‘Magnificent Seven’ (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) look more favourable. For instance, their aggregate forward price-to-earnings ratio is at a 40% premium compared to the rest of the US S&P 500, its lowest level since 2018.[1] Nvidia is trading on a valuation of 24 times earnings, which looks relatively attractive considering its high profit margins and potential for rapid growth in expected sales over the coming years from AI demand. The US 30-year Treasury yield is currently at 4.6%, down 0.4% points from a peak in mid-January. Fundamentally, given US mortgage rates are priced-off the long-term cost of government borrowing, less money is being spent on making interest payments, potentially giving a boost to the housing market to drive economic growth. Lower Treasury yields also support stocks by making equity valuations look more attractive to government bonds. Although it is early days, the ructions seen in equities does not appear to have dampened consumer expenditure. That’s because with inflation slowing and jobs being created, annual real take-home pay grew nearly 2% in January. Moreover, deregulation and expected tax cuts should drive hiring. The National Federation of Independent Business survey (a barometer of small business sentiment) shows that hiring intentions are at their highest level in over a year. Importantly, this should give consumers the confidence to shop. Providing the US economy continues to grow at a relatively healthy clip, this increases the chances that companies can deliver on consensus earnings’ expectations. As it stands the consensus expects MSCI USA earnings-per-share (EPS) growth of 12.1% in 2025, a modest downgrade from 14.5% at the start of the year. However, in early January, EPS for 2026 has been revised up to 14.5% from 13.2%.[2] Overall, there has been little change in company earnings’ expectations when averaging out this year and next. To summarise, US equities have felt the brunt of uncertain China-US geopolitical tensions. On the upside, the ‘Magnificent Seven’ stock valuations have adjusted to more reasonable levels. The US dollar appears to have peaked to create favourable financial conditions for stocks. Moreover, the economic outlook remains encouraging, supported by consumption and the labour market, but with increased downside risks from policy uncertainty. Trump appears willing to tolerate volatile markets in the short term to achieve his longer-term goals of weakening the dollar and keeping the cost of government borrowing down to fund his domestic priorities. For that he will still need to find common ground with President Xi in the summer. Daniel Casalii is the Chief Investment Strategist at Evelyn Partners

Title: BI spoke with federal workers who voted for Trump — some have come to regret it

Good morning. The backlash Tesla owners are facing over Elon Musk has crossed the pond. Here in London, a man says he was aghast when he was confronted about his vehicle in a parking lot.In today's big story, BI spoke with 10 federal workers who voted for Trump. Months later, some of them now regret it. What's on deck Markets: Rob Arnott thinks the market's tech stock sell-off isn't over. Tech: BI reviewed a leaked ByteDance document showing TikTok staff being evaluated on their "ByteStyle" and more. Business: Needy hospitals are trapped in a cycle of corporate plunder, Bethany McLean writes. But first, some voters feel hoodwinked. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. "I feel betrayed. This is not what I wanted, to let everybody lose their job." That's what a two-time Trump voter who works for Veterans Affairs told BI. "You're fired. You're fired. You're fired. This is not 'The Apprentice.'" So far, tens of thousands of workers have already lost their jobs as a result of DOGE's efforts to reshape the federal workforce. With Elon Musk as de facto leader, the DOGE office initiatives have ranged from dismantling agencies like USAID to slashing budgets and sweeping layoffs — some of which have been reversed by court order. Just a few months ago, some of the workers impacted by the cuts may have been celebrating Trump's election victory. They voted for a better economy, lower prices, or more stringent border controls. What they didn't expect was an existential threat to their careers. BI spoke to current and former federal workers who voted for Trump — and some have come to regret it. "If I knew I was going to lose my job because Trump became president, no, I would not vote for him," one worker said. Betrayal. Anger. Regret. You can read what all the workers told BI here. For federal workers hoping to now pivot to the private sector, things might be tricky. Lackluster corporate hiring, a shrinking middle-management job market, and pullbacks by universities are making the route to employment beyond federal agencies trickier to navigate, BI's Tim Paradis writes. Federal workers also face a unique hurdle. Recruiters and career coaches told BI that many federal workers have the know-how to succeed in private industry, yet they might struggle to make that clear. Adopting a key new skill might help them: translation. 1. Rob Arnott says the sell-off in tech stocks isn't over. "We're seeing the unwinding of a bubble," Arnott, the founder of Research Affiliates, told BI. He compared the current market to the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and warned that the Magnificent Seven stocks are set to slide further. 2. Why China looks investible again. Just a year ago, investors fled the country in droves as they lost faith in its post-pandemic economy, with the CSI 300 dropping over 45%. Now, the country's stocks are rallying, thanks to a pro-tech shift from Beijing — and analysts are paying attention. 3. Follow these leaders for sharp insights on recessions. Leading economists are bracing for a recession, although there's been no official call yet. BI compiled a list of the best commentators on recessions, and the warning signs they're watching. 1. Amazon's DeepSeek scramble. When DeepSeek debuted in January, customer demand was so high Amazon rushed to add the AI to its development tool Bedrock. Now, Amazon wants to promote its products as an alternative to DeepSeek and is telling employees to point out its privacy and security issues, according to internal guidelines seen by BI. 2. Meet the Palantir Mafia. The software company's alumni have collectively raised more than $6 billion for their own startups, which include the social-gathering app Partiful and the defense-tech company Anduril. See BI's list of 30 Palantir alums who struck out on their own. 3. How TikTok scores employees. It's performance review season for TikTok employees, and BI viewed a rubric to see how they're scored. Workers are measured on Output, Leadership Principles, and ByteStyles — i.e. a set of workplace values. If an employee receives a low rating, though, they could end up on a PIP. 1. How wealthy investors keep bankrupting needy hospitals. As Steward Health Care closed hospitals and cut corners on care, its top officers got richer, and the profits kept flowing to its private-equity owner Cerberus. Now, its bankruptcy reveals a deeper flaw in America's healthcare infrastructure: Facilities that have been plundered can only be sold to others who are likely to continue the plundering, Bethany McLean writes. 2. Older Americans on the shifting job market. Some are taking blue- collar jobs, while others are navigating unemployment. Many told BI that ageism, technology changes, and economic shifts have affected their retirement plans. 3. The ghosted generation. College app rejections. No-show dates. Job apps sent into the void. No one has been more rejected in both their personal and professional lives than Gen Z, writes Delia Cai. It's led young people to adopt a blasé attitude in order to protect themselves — and it could turn them into a generation of incredibly risk-averse adults. It's St. Patrick's Day.

Title: The weight loss drug shortage is over — and some patients are 'panicking'

Time Published: 2025-03-17T09:00:00Z

For Maria Rising, managing her health felt like chasing a phantom. The 30-year-old Lansing, Mich. consultant has for years battled polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — a hormonal disorder that can cause weight fluctuations, insulin resistance, and in some cases debilitating pain. “It’s like hitting a moving target,” Rising said, describing the endless treatments that never quite worked. Then came a glimmer of hope: In January 2024, her gynecologist suggested Zepbound (LLY), one of the GLP-1 medications proving remarkably effective at treating a host of conditions, including managing PCOS symptoms. The drugs worked so well they’d become victims of their own success — Rising found herself at the back of a very long line. “I was calling pharmacies. I was calling all over the state. I was like, ‘I’ll drive and go get it if you have it.’ But nobody had it,” she said. When Rising couldn’t find Zepbound at any pharmacy, she explored alternatives, in consultation with her doctors, and eventually turned to compounded tirzepatide — an off-brand version of the active ingredient in Zepbound. Rising currently pays $287 a month for her compounded medication, a steep discount compared to the branded drug’s nearly $1,000 price tag. Since being on the drug, she has lost 40 pounds and other symptoms have eased. But that might all change very soon. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced the end of shortages that have plagued popular weight-loss drugs, like Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s (NVO) Wegovy. With branded options now deemed “fully available,” the agency plans to crack down on compounded GLP-1 medications as soon as this month — a regulatory pivot that could reshape access for patients like Rising overnight. Soaring demand for weight-loss drugs has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the world’s most valuable pharma companies. At the same time, shortages have created a lucrative market for compounders and telehealth companies. But for patients, the situation is far less fortunate. These changes could cut off access to affordable alternatives for thousands of people, including Rising. “There’s a lot of folks really panicked right now about it. I don’t want to go back to having crazy pain every day from PCOS either,” Rising said. Rising now has few options. She could switch to an expensive branded medication or — what she intends to do — continue her treatment with a customized, clinically necessary compounded version of tirzepatide that meets stricter regulatory standards. But that path is more uncertain. Recent FDA decisions are reshaping the market for compounded (or off-brand) versions of GLP-1 drugs, which have served as a workaround during supply shortages. The move has also intensified a battle between Big Pharma and compounding pharmacies over control of GLP-1 sales in the U.S. Compounding involves modifying FDA-approved drugs to meet individual patient needs, such as adjusting dosages, changing administration methods, or removing allergens — the kind of customization Rising is now relying on to access tirzepatide. Typically, the FDA prohibits compounding drugs that are exact copies of commercially available medications. However, when a drug is in shortage, these types of compounded versions are allowed. This regulatory loophole has proved lucrative for compounding pharmacies. Olympia Pharmaceuticals, which entered the GLP-1 market just 18 months ago, has seen demand surge by 15-20%. The company’s CFO, Joshua Fritzler, said in a February media roundtable that Olympia’s phones now ring constantly with doctors and patients “panicking” about where they’ll obtain medication when the FDA’s new restrictions take effect. Olympia is a member of the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) trade group that sued the FDA twice over the removal of tirzepatide and then semaglutide (Ozempic’s active ingredient) from its shortage list. The group argued that the shortages persist and that the FDA’s decision will harm patients by limiting access to affordable alternatives. A judge recently sided with the FDA in the tirzepatide case and the agency has issued a clarification on its policies regarding compounded GLP-1s. The FDA will begin enforcing rules against outsourcing facilities making compounded tirzepatide on March 19. Smaller pharmacies (503A’s) are already past their deadline. For compounded semaglutide, 503A pharmacies have until April 22 and 503B facilities have until May 22 — or until there is a court decision in the semaglutide case, whichever date comes later. Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, and Eli Lilly have both contended that compounded versions of their medications are unsafe. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients,” Novo Nordisk said in a statement when the FDA declared the end of the semaglutide shortage. Eli Lilly made a similar statement: “FDA was also clear that compounders must immediately begin transitioning patients taking compounded tirzepatide knockoffs to FDA-approved tirzepatide medicines.” However, both companies have a big financial interest in limiting the sales of compounded GLP-1s. Eli Lilly’s stock price has climbed more than 50% since the FDA approved Zepbound in November 2023, pushing its market cap above $800 billion. Novo Nordisk has similarly seen its stock rise 86% since Wegovy launched in 2021. Novo Nordisk’s U.S. executive vice president, David Moore, recently told investors in February that compounded drugs were cutting into the company’s sales more rapidly than expected. Meanwhile, some compounders have also made a killing with GLP-1s. The millennial-targeted telehealth company Hims & Hers started offering compounded semaglutide last May. The company’s total sales grew 69% last year to $1.5 billion. “Now that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,” Hims CEO Andrew Dudum wrote in a post on X in February. “We’re also closely monitoring potential future shortages.” Fritzler said GLP-1 medications make up about half of Olympia’s business by volume, with the company producing tens of thousands of vials each week. Despite this, he emphasized that Olympia will comply with regulations and will not attempt to circumvent the law by creating customized compounded GLP-1s. Fritzler told Quartz that he expects that most patients will transition to branded medications, while others might switch to liraglutide — an older and less effective GLP-1 drug that requires daily injections rather than the weekly regimen of newer medications. For others, the cost and inconvenience has become too overwhelming. Michelle Pierce, 25, is a patient from Austin who also has relied on a compounded semaglutide to treat her PCOS. She first tried metformin, a common type 2 diabetes medication, but it wasn’t effective for her. Her doctor then recommended a GLP-1 drug, but getting insurance coverage was a challenge, requiring an extensive pre-authorization process and two appeals. Even after approval, the $600 monthly cost for Ozempic was too high, so her doctor suggested compounded semaglutide as a more affordable alternative. Now, however, she fears she won’t be able to afford treatment moving forward. Instead, she plans to taper off the medication over the next few months, despite concerns that stopping it could affect her insulin levels and carries the risk of regaining weight. “I have great insurance — private Aetna (CVS) insurance — and I still can’t get a medication that has changed my life,” Pierce said.

Title: Rocket Lab boosts Varda's space manufacturing with third successful orbital mission

This deployment follows closely on the heels of Varda's W-2 mission, which concluded with a successful reentry and landing just 15 days prior. Like its predecessor, the W-3 mission is powered by Rocket Lab's advanced Pioneer spacecraft platform. Pioneer provides critical support to Varda's 120kg manufacturing capsule in orbit, supplying power, communication links, propulsion, and attitude control throughout the mission. The capsule enables Varda to conduct pharmaceutical production in microgravity, a unique environment that cannot be replicated on Earth and is particularly advantageous for certain drug development processes. The Pioneer spacecraft incorporates Rocket Lab's comprehensive suite of in-house designed components and subsystems. These include propulsion units, flight control software, avionics, star trackers, reaction wheels, separation mechanisms, solar arrays, communication systems, composite structures, and propellant tanks. Upon completion of the manufacturing operations in orbit, Rocket Lab manages the deorbit process, executing maneuvers to guide the capsule back toward Earth. The mission plan concludes with reentry and landing at the Koonibba Test Range in South Australia, which is managed by Southern Launch. This marks Rocket Lab's third successful mission for Varda; the inaugural W-1 mission ended with a landing in Utah in February 2024, while W-2 concluded with a touchdown in South Australia on February 27, 2025. "The W-1 mission was the first in-space manufacturing mission to happen outside of the International Space Station. Now, just over a year later, we have a third mission on orbit after bringing another one safely back home. We're immensely proud to have supported our mission partner Varda to usher in a new era of rapid, reliable, and innovative commercial in-space manufacturing and hypersonic reentry capability," said Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab Founder and CEO. "It's remarkable that we have been able to launch our third mission in such rapid succession after the reentry of our second. High cadence launch and return will soon be commonplace, and reentry of materials from space to Earth will go from being novel to being normal," said Wendy Shimata, VP of Autonomous Systems at Varda. Rocket Lab's fourth Pioneer spacecraft for Varda is nearing completion, with final assembly taking place at the company's Spacecraft Production Complex and Headquarters in Long Beach, California.

We're immensely proud to have supported our mission partner Varda to usher in a new era of rapid, reliable, and innovative commercial in-space manufacturing and hypersonic reentry capability," said Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab Founder and CEO. "It's remarkable that we have been able to launch our third mission in such rapid succession after the reentry of our second. High cadence launch and return will soon be commonplace, and reentry of materials from space to Earth will go from being novel to being normal," said Wendy Shimata, VP of Autonomous Systems at Varda. Rocket Lab's fourth Pioneer spacecraft for Varda is nearing completion, with final assembly taking place at the company's Spacecraft Production Complex and Headquarters in Long Beach, California.

The mission plan concludes with reentry and landing at the Koonibba Test Range in South Australia, which is managed by Southern Launch. This marks Rocket Lab's third successful mission for Varda; the inaugural W-1 mission ended with a landing in Utah in February 2024, while W-2 concluded with a touchdown in South Australia on February 27, 2025.

The mission, named "The Lightning God Reigns," lifted off from Launch Complex 1 at Mahia, New Zealand, on March 15, 2025, at 1:00 p.m. NZDT (00:00 UTC). The Electron rocket delivered iQPS' QPS-SAR-9 satellite into a circular orbit 575 kilometers above Earth. This launch follows a December 2023 mission in which Rocket Lab deployed another SAR satellite for iQPS, supporting the development of its radar imaging satellite network. This successful deployment is the first of eight planned launches for iQPS under one of Rocket Lab's largest launch contracts. The agreement includes five more missions in 2025 and two in 2026, all contributing to iQPS' vision of a 36-satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation. The system is designed to deliver high-resolution, all-weather, day-and-night Earth observation capabilities worldwide. Rocket Lab's next mission for iQPS is targeted for no earlier than May 2025. The company's founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, emphasized the significance of Electron's role in enabling constellation missions: "Congratulations to the Rocket Lab and iQPS teams on yet another successful mission together. Every Electron launch in 2025 so far has been to expand a satellite constellation and with this latest mission success, you can see why. Electron provides our customers with total flexibility and control over their schedule, orbit, and other critical mission elements to create their constellation exactly as they need it. We're looking forward to continuing our constellation build out for iQPS this year and next." Dr. Shunsuke Onishi, CEO of iQPS, highlighted the collaboration's efficiency: "I sincerely appreciate the dedication and hard work of the teams at iQPS and Rocket Lab in making this launch mission a success, and I am truly impressed by the short timeline from QPS-SAR-9's departure from Fukuoka, Japan, through its journey via Mahia Peninsula, to its successful deployment into LEO. As we prepare for the launch of seven more QPS-SARs between this year and next year, I am reassured by the reliability and efficiency of Electron in executing missions like this one." Rocket Lab is set to launch its next mission from Launch Complex 1 in just three days, with liftoff scheduled for March 18, 2025 NZDT.

March 16, 2025 21:48 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: Developing the future workforce

Time Published: 2025-03-16T22:56:00Z

Large-scale layoffs have continued in recent months, indicating ongoing economic challenges. Contributing factors include a decline in domestic purchasing power and growing external pressures, caused by the trade war. As the job market remains uncertain, businesses are calling on the government to accelerate the development of a workforce better suited to meet both global and local demands. More manufacturers, especially those in the car and auto parts industries, are likely to lay off workers or close this year as they succumb to a plunge in domestic sales, worsened by the impact of the new tariff policy and trade war triggered by US President Donald Trump, said Tanit Sorat, vice-chairman of the Employers' Confederation of Thai Trade and Industry. More than 100 factories were shuttered monthly last year for the second year in a row, according to Kasikorn Research Center. This rate will certainly continue in 2025, said Mr Tanit. "We should see a number of factory closures near the end of the second quarter," he said. The shutdowns will mainly be in the automotive industry, which has experienced sluggish sales since 2023, said Mr Tanit. Last year domestic vehicle sales plunged by 26.1% year-on-year due mainly to banks and financing companies' strict criteria for auto loans, concerned about non-performing loans given the high level of household debt, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI). "This is a very serious situation for automakers when one-fourth of total sales disappears," said Mr Tanit. "Some auto manufacturers have avoided layoffs for two years, but they will let a number of workers go this year, with Trump's policy the catalyst." Trump announced last month he would impose a 25% tariff on car imports on April 2, but the levy on shipments from Canada and Mexico was paused for one month after taking effect on March 4. The FTI earlier warned of the negative impact on passenger cars and commercial motor vehicles exported to the US, while local auto parts makers are worried the new tariff policy will affect their exports to Japanese auto companies invested in Mexico. "We also export auto parts to the US, especially tyres popular among American customers," he said. Other industries, especially plastics, garments and furniture, will also be affected by Trump's tariff policy as the US-China trade war will worsen the influx of low-cost Chinese products, dealing a blow to local manufacturers and workers, warned the FTI. Mr Tanit said he does not expect an alarming increase to the overall unemployment rate in Thailand this year. However, roughly 420,000 people will graduate from academic institutions this year, adding more pressure to job-seekers in a highly competitive labour market. "We've been trapped at a low employment level for 10 years, stuck at this bottom level," he said. (photo credit : Somchai Poomlard) Prasert Taedullayasatit, president of the Thai Condominium Association, said many residential developers have trimmed their organisations for a while based on weak market signals over the past few years. "The layoffs this year stemmed from poor performance the previous year," he said. "Reducing staff is one way to cut costs. Some companies reduced employees in investment businesses that did not meet expectations." According to the 2024 financial statements of 24 listed developers primarily engaged in residential development, only three reported a year-on-year rise in net profit margin as a percentage of revenue, while 14 posted a decline and seven reported losses. One of the two companies that were reported to have laid off up to 40% of their staff saw their net profit margins plummet, falling from more than 22% in 2023 to just 11% last year. Another firm experienced a nosedive from 8.9% to just 2.3%. Mr Prasert, also chief operating officer of SET-listed Ananda Development, said it has frozen new hires for a while, and when employees leave it does not hire replacements. Therdsak Thaveeteeratham, executive vice-president of Asia Plus Securities, said the layoffs by property developers are a response to the market slowdown. "Layoffs are one strategy to cut costs and reduce expenses. There is no cause for concern," he said. This strategy of managing costs through workforce reduction reflects how developers are adjusting to a challenging real estate market, focusing on operational efficiency during times of uncertainty. Sutee Ketsiri, managing director of homebuilder Built To Build Group, said residential development has been unfavourable for two years, with a decline in sales prompting contractors to take on construction jobs from clients other than developers. "The number of home construction jobs, even from large developers, has shrunk significantly, causing many contractors to increasingly take on self-built home jobs over the past year," he said. Jackie Wang, country director of Google Thailand, said Thailand is experiencing a rapid technological shift across several industries. While some jobs may evolve in response to the automation of certain tasks, the greater potential of artificial intelligence (AI) lies in augmenting skills humans perform well, she said. AI can be leveraged to amplify human strengths in creativity, empathy and critical thinking at work, said Ms Wang. "For the tech industry, we continue to see strong demand for roles specialising in AI development, cloud computing and cybersecurity, to name a few. At Google, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas, such as AI and cloud," she said. Ms Wang said for students or those looking to prepare for the AI-driven future, foundational skills such as communication, problem solving and critical thinking will be even more important in this dynamic environment. People should also have a good understanding of AI tools, she said. "We have recommended governments invest in building an AI-ready workforce by adapting skills programmes across sectors, developing national AI training and support programmes, and establishing public-private partnerships to scale these programmes and make them accessible to all workers," said Ms Wang. "We are committed to working with partners on this issue. For instance, our digital training programme Samart Skills has trained 13,000 students and job-seekers in Thailand thus far." She said over the past five years, Google trained more than 3.6 million Thais, including students, educators, small and medium-sized enterprises and developers. "AI presents incredible opportunities for us to evolve and create a more productive and fulfilling work environment, while boosting local economic growth," said Ms Wang. "I encourage people to approach AI with curiosity and optimism, and I am excited for the opportunities it will open up." Prae Dumrongmongcolgul, country director of Facebook Thailand, said the integration of AI has revolutionised the IT industry, driving a significant surge in demand for professionals skilled in AI programming languages such as Python, machine learning, data engineering and data science. This transformation is not unique to the IT industry, as AI has touched companies and organisations worldwide in different ways, she said. "However, we believe human-AI collaboration remains crucial to advancing this technology. By showcasing how AI can augment human capabilities rather than replace them, we can unlock its full potential," said Ms Prae. She said Meta has developed tools that enhance productivity, such as AI assistants that help write basic code blocks, allowing engineers to focus on more advanced tasks. Ms Prae said rather than replacing jobs, AI supplements them, offering endless possibilities. For example, AI can enhance medical diagnoses with accurate and efficient tools, or help business owners predict customer purchases, as well as create new professions, just as the internet gave rise to web development, she said. "As technology evolves, jobs change and new ones emerge," said Ms Prae. "Ultimately the future of work is not about replacement but augmentation, and we are committed to developing AI solutions that empower humans to achieve their full potential." Somchai Sittichaisrichart, managing director of SiS Distribution (Thailand), said the local tech industry still faces a shortage of workers, particularly in cybersecurity, cloud and AI. He said youngsters are not interested in learning tech skills, while emerging technology evolves all the time. The tech industry will likely continue to face a worker shortage, said Mr Somchai. Regarding concerns that AI will replace human workers in Thailand, he said it will not happen soon, but could start in two years. Vatsun Thirapatarapong, country manager of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Thailand, said the tech industry has robust demand for people with AI skills, which should continue to increase. AWS regularly updates courseware to train AI skills in the tech and non-tech sectors. The company aims to produce 100,000 AI-ready workers by 2026. Maneerut Anulomsombut, chief executive of Sea (Thailand), a Singaporean internet tech firm, said the economic uncertainty is causing cautious talent acquisition among Thai companies, including those in the tech sector. Every organisation prioritises recruiting individuals skilled in tech fields, she said. A group of former employees of Alpha Spinning, AMC Spinning and Body Fashion (Thailand) staged a protest demanding the government urgently help laid-off workers last week. (photo credit: Chanat Katanyu) Pun Paniangvait, general manager of Thai President Foods Plc, the manufacturer of Mama instant noodles, said the company expects to expand its workforce in line with the growth of its manufacturing operations. The company employs more than 6,000 staff and consistently implements new technologies including robotics to reduce the workload in certain areas of production, such as heavy lifting of ingredients. The use of robots lifts productivity and improves labour welfare, he said. For example, once the instant noodles are produced, robots handle the packing process and arrange the products on pallets, reducing the reliance on staff for various stages of production. A typical production line now operates with about 25 workers, a decrease from 30 in years past. The company also integrated AI to improve efficiency in administrative tasks such as summarising reports. The use of labour-saving machinery could help the company remain resilient amid rising labour costs, said Mr Pun. "The main goal is to keep the labour cost per unit of Mama manageable," he said. "By using labour-saving machinery, we can enhance worker productivity and potentially reduce the average labour cost per unit." Mr Pun said the company usually raises the daily minimum wage annually, regardless of government policy. He said the positions most often in demand are mechanics with vocational or higher vocational certificates who possess the skills and experience necessary to begin work immediately. Mr Pun said the government should offer more support for vocational education. Furthermore, he encouraged local businesses to collaborate with vocational colleges to provide on-the-job training, which could create a pool of skilled workers in specific areas and reduce labour migration to industrial cities such as Rayong. This could increase economic growth in the provinces and distribute wealth across the country, said Mr Pun. Thaniwan Kulmongkol, president of the Thai Restaurant Association, said restaurant operators with sufficient resources are more inclined to invest in automation technologies. She pointed to the rising trend of restaurants adopting self-service systems, like ordering through tablets or kiosks and implementing self-pickup stations. This shift not only decreases reliance on manpower, but also opens avenues for restaurant growth without the stress of workforce shortages, said Mrs Thaniwan. There are still many opportunities within the restaurant industry to incorporate technology, especially in back-end systems that help with managing raw materials and calculating food costs, she said. However, the industry will continue to hire staff, as the cost of implementing technology in restaurants remains high, said Mrs Thaniwan. "Even in restaurants that embrace automation, there is still a need for employees to monitor these systems," she said. "Workers must develop the necessary skills to operate and maintain this technology." Labour shortages are a persistent challenge for restaurants, leading some operators to offer daily wages that exceed the minimum wage, said Mrs Thaniwan. Thai workers are often hesitant to accept jobs in restaurants based on the demanding nature of the work and relatively low wages, she said. In contrast, foreign workers are more willing to take these positions, as earning 10,000 baht is a substantial income for them, said Mrs Thaniwan. She proposed restaurant operators restructure their pay systems to offer wages aligned with educational qualifications, though this may result in higher food prices. Mrs Thaniwan emphasised the need for a significant overhaul of Thailand's educational system to ensure the workforce is equipped with the technological skills necessary for the evolving industry. Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said total employment tallied 40.1 million in 2024, including 19.5 million in services and trade, 11.8 million in agriculture and 8.72 million in manufacturing. The unemployment total is roughly 390,000. Labour Ministry data indicates 19.2% of surveyed businesses, totalling 2,254 enterprises, are actively seeking workers. The sectors with the highest demand include wholesale and retail trade, automotive and motorcycle repair services, accounting for 36% of demand from 812 enterprises; manufacturing comprised 17.9%, with 403 enterprises hiring; and construction, making up 11.3% or 254 enterprises. Mr Sanan said the challenges include an ageing population, declining birth rates, low labour productivity, decreased worker skills, and a gap between labour market needs and worker quality. "The quality of education, both formal and vocational, needs improvement," he said. Given these challenges, the integration of AI in the workforce has become increasingly relevant, especially in the industrial and service sectors, said Mr Sanan. AI is recognised for its potential to enhance efficiency and reduce labour costs. He pointed to China's initiative to introduce AI courses in primary and secondary education in Beijing, aimed at positioning the nation as a future technological superpower. "This approach offers a valuable model for the Thai government to consider when formulating labour and education policies that can enhance Thailand's labour productivity in line with future demands," said Mr Sanan. "Establishing AI training institutes in provinces is an essential step to equip the future workforce." Employers will continue to rely on human talent, as qualities like creativity, craftsmanship, effective communication and the ability to solve intricate problems remain beyond the reach of AI, he said.

Title: Microsoft's 1986 IPO

David L. Farquhar on technology old and new, computer security, and more Home » Retro Computing » Microsoft’s 1986 IPO On March 13, 1986, Microsoft shook up the financial world, and to some degree, we are still feeling the reverberations from that 40 years later. That was the day of Microsoft’s very successful IPO. The hunt for the next Microsoft began immediately, leading directly to the dotcom bubble of the turn of the century. Microsoft’s IPO initially valued company at $21.00 per share. It raised $61 million for the company, and put its market capitalization at $777 million. The price peaked at $35.50 per share before settling to $27.75 at the end of the day. Microsoft expected it to take weeks to reach $27.75. Bill Gates owned 45% of the company’s stock, which meant on March 14, 1986, he was worth almost $350 million. He had not yet turned 31. The next year, he became the youngest person to become a billionaire, before he had turned 32. Founded in 1975, Microsoft was an 11-year-old company at the time it went public. They waited so long because Bill Gates wanted to maintain control over the company as long as he could. By 1986, Microsoft had to go public. This wasn’t because they needed money. Their profit margins were enviable, at 34% of their pre tax revenue. Microsoft didn’t need the $61 million the IPO raised. The reason Microsoft had to go public in 1986 was because Bill Gates had been using stock to attract talent. Microsoft projected that by sometime in 1987, they would have 500 shareholders, which would require Microsoft to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, effectively turning them into a publicly traded company, but without the benefits of going public in the conventional way. Backed into this corner, Gates agreed in late 1985 to pursue an IPO. Motley Fool greatly oversimplifies Microsoft’s early years, as do others. They’re better at SEO than analysis. Microsoft’s best known products in 1986 were PC DOS and MS-DOS, the text-based operating systems for IBM and IBM-compatible PCs. In 1986, Microsoft Windows existed, barely, but wasn’t yet successful. Microsoft’s secret was that virtually every computer on the market was running some Microsoft product. Its operating system powered the booming PC market. But Excel was the most popular spreadsheet on the Macintosh. Its predecessor, Multiplan, was a reasonably popular spreadsheet on other platforms. Microsoft Word was an up and coming word processor. Microsoft Basic was one of the most popular programming languages, and ran on virtually every platform. Sometimes Microsoft licensed software on a royalty basis and sometimes for a flat rate up front. Getting the flat rate up front shielded Microsoft from losing profits to piracy early on. But once Microsoft could afford to risk some loss to piracy, it was more profitable to take a royalty per unit sold. There were 60 million IBM and IBM-compatible PCs sold in the 1980s, and Microsoft collected a royalty on virtually every single one. Then in 1991, it discovered it could sell new versions of MS-DOS as upgrades and make money on each unit sold a second time. When Windows 3.0 hit the market in May 1990, the game was essentially over. Microsoft could sell you an operating system, a graphical environment, and versions of Word and Excel that ran in that environment, all running on commodity hardware that was getting cheaper by the quarter, if not the month. Although it would be a few years before other companies would give up, a monopoly in operating systems and office suites was inevitable before 1990 was over. The more successful Microsoft became, the more afraid of failure and anticompetitive it became. This led to legal issues in the late 1990s. Microsoft reformed to a degree and is more tolerant of certain competing products continuing to exist than it was in the 90s. Today, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet (formerly Google) are larger than Microsoft, but the four companies are the only technology firms in the 2024 Fortune 20 list. The fifth largest technology firm is Meta, the social media company everyone loves to hate, at #30. To this day, young ambitious people enroll in school to get technical degrees in hopes of becoming the next Bill Gates, and venture capitalists like Kevin O’Leary and Marc Andreessen (himself a cofounder of a failed dotcom) prey on them. These ambitious programmer/entrepreneurs rarely get rich, but the venture capitalists have figured out how to make money even as the businesses they fund fail. Today’s entrepreneurs would do well to note that Microsoft made minimal use of venture capital. Microsoft’s only VC only owned 6.2 percent of the company. Gates didn’t trust them. If you’re thinking of trying your hand at being the next Bill Gates, keep that in mind. Another direct consequence of the Microsoft IPO was the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and the subsequent recession. Fear of missing out on the next Microsoft drove up the value of anything tech- or Internet-related. Investors believed the next Microsoft would come out of that generation of companies. In the end they were kind of right. Two companies from that wave ended up matching and eventually eclipsing Microsoft. But it wasn’t exactly clear until a few years after the dotcom bust that Amazon and Google would be the ones to do it. Short-lived randos like VA Linux, Geocities, Cyberrebate, and Internet America were able to come along for the ride while the market shook out.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds. Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Editor’s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round.

Title: Gensol fast-charged Blu-Smart. But their ties are a governance puzzle

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Bengaluru: On 16 January, Refex Industries Ltd, a manufacturer of refrigerant gases, informed the stock exchanges that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Refex Green Mobility, had agreed to buy 2,997 electric cars from Gensol Engineering Ltd. Refex Green Mobility would take over Gensol’s existing loan of ₹315 crore as part of this transaction. Gensol Engineering Ltd also informed the same to the exchanges. Shares of Refex ended 1.6% higher the next day, while shares of Gensol remained unchanged. This transaction came under the spotlight after Gensol, a solar engineering, procurement and electric vehicle (EV) financing company, saw two rating agencies downgrade its borrowing to default earlier this month. Rating agency Icra even said Gensol is falsifying statements. Gensol denies any wrongdoing and claims that this sale should help reduce its debt, from ₹1,146 crore to ₹831 crore. So, why is there a problem? Many unanswered questions linger, particularly around the company’s ties with the privately held Blu-Smart Mobility Ltd, the electric cab-hailing service. Blu-Smart was co-founded by Anmol Singh Jaggi; the 39-year-old is also the chairman and managing director of Gensol. In Gensol’s EV financing business, the company buys cars and then leases them to other companies. Gensol acknowledges that it owns 2,997 EVs that are part of Blu-Smart’s fleet. But that’s not the complete story—Blu-Smart’s fleet consists of 8,000 cars and Gensol, according to people Mint spoke to, owns a meaty share of this number. While Gensol didn’t disclose the overall number of cars it owns, and the number it leased to Blu-Smart, a spokesperson for Blu-Smart stated that multiple lessors lease out vehicles to the ride hailing company. According to two investors courted by Blu-Smart, two board members, and one proxy advisory firm executive, Gensol’s lack of transparency about its close ties with the cab-hailing company, particularly around the money spent on cars and loans granted, raises questions around Gensol’s corporate governance practices. Essential details, including the terms of lease partnerships, remain shrouded in mystery. Above all, a Mint investigation reveals that Gensol’s balance sheet has been used to build Blu-Smart’s business even as the cab-hailing company continues to be a privately owned one. Mint reviewed Gensol and Blu-Smart’s financials, including an investment proposal made by the electric cab-hailing service to prospective investors in October last year. We also spoke with seven executives to piece together this story. Growing togetherJaggi founded Gensol in 2012 as a strategic advisory firm. By 2017, he started a solar engineering and procurement business. Two years later, in 2019, Gensol went public. The same year, Jaggi started a new business division, Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd, to finance EVs. Outside of Gensol, in 2019, Jaggi also set up Blu-Smart Mobility Ltd. View Full Image A file photo of Anmol Singh Jaggi, CMD of Gensol and co-founder, Blu-Smart. (Mint) First, let us examine Gensol’s EV lease business and Blu-Smart’s journey to understand the ties between the two firms better. Up until 2022, Gensol’s EV lease business was almost a non-starter. According to Gensol’s investor presentations, the business reported ₹4 crore in revenue in FY20; ₹3 crore in FY21, and ₹5 crore in FY22. By the end of March 2022, the EV business owned a little over 700 cars, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. According to the same executive, Blu-Smart started with 70 cars in 2019. In its early days, it received a $3 million investment from angel investors. By March 2021, it had 400 cars and hit an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 million. The number of cars on its platform more than doubled to 900 in FY22, when its ARR touched $8 million. Gensol’s EV business showed its first real growth in FY23 when it reported ₹41 crore in revenue, followed by ₹134 crore in FY24. Growth at Blu-Smart also picked up during this time. It ended FY23 with 3,100 cars and an annual revenue rate of $29 million, while the number of cars more than doubled to 7,300 last year. Its ARR totalled $60 million. In April-December 2024, 72.3%, or ₹764 crore, of Gensol’s ₹1,056 crore revenue was generated from the solar EPC business. The remaining 27.7%, or ₹294, came from the EV leasing arm, according to the company’s latest investor presentation. Gensol was, and continues to be, Blu-Smart’s largest car supplier, accounting for over 87% of its 8,000 fleet, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. Consequently, Blu-Smart has emerged as Gensol’s largest customer for its EV lease business, accounting for over 90% of the ₹294 crore business it received in the first nine months of the current financial year, the executive further mentioned. The fuelSo, where did Gensol get the money from to expand its EV leasing business, which, in turn, fuelled Jaggi’s privately held electric cab business? In 2021, Gensol first received ₹35.55 crore from the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd (Ireda), a state-owned company, for its EV lease business. In August 2022, Gensol told investors that it had received Ireda’s nod to buy 3,000 EVs. In January last year, Gensol said that Ireda had sanctioned a fatter loan— ₹513 crore—one that would allow the company to finance 3,800 EVs. An Ireda spokesperson told Mint that Gensol has utilized the loans given to finance cars for Blu-Smart Mobility. This implies that Ireda knew Gensol was building an EV ride-hailing business through Blu-Smart. At the end of December 2024, Ireda had unpaid loans of ₹470 crore from Gensol, according to Icra, the ratings agency. The modelWhy couldn’t Ireda give loans to Blu-Smart directly? Probably because Blu-Smart always wanted to remain an asset-light business. “No Asset Ownership Burden—Company Managed Cars", Blu-Smart claims on the third page of its 25-page investment deck sent to prospective investors in October 2024. Mint reviewed a copy of this document. The privately-held firm is yet to file its financials with the ministry of corporate affairs for the year ending March 2024. According to this investor presentation, Blu-Smart had 8,000 cars as on 31 September 2024. Gensol, meanwhile, didn’t tell Mint how many cars it owns overall, limiting its commentary to the transaction it inked with Refex in January this year. “Gensol is the owner of these 2,997 cars and post the transaction, Refex would be leasing the same vehicles to BluSmart," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. “Gensol Engineering Ltd (GEL), was an early supporter of BluSmart’s EV mission and as BluSmart has increased its presence, multiple more lessors have now leased vehicles to BluSmart," the spokesperson added. Apart from Gensol (which owns over 87% or about 7,000 of Blu-Smart’s fleet), other leasers include state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd and Quiklyz, the vehicle leasing and subscription business of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd.

The important thing which has not been reported until now is that Gensol spent ₹568 crore in the three years to March 2024 to buy electric cars, according to a review of the company’s annual reports by Mint. In FY24 alone, Gensol spent ₹352.14 crore to buy cars. Gensol granted ₹148.33 crore as loans to three Blu-Smart subsidiaries in the year ended March 2024: Blu-Smart Fleet Pvt. Ltd received ₹138.87 crore while Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd and Blu-Smart Mobility Tech Pvt. Ltd received ₹9.19 crore and ₹0.27 crore, respectively. Simply put, Gensol spent over ₹500 crore last year to build Blu-Smart, considering that most of the cars bought by the firm in 2024 ( ₹352.14 crore) were also leased to the ride hailing firm. This is not a small amount considering that on 3 March, Care Ratings Ltd downgraded Gensol’s ₹716 crore bank loan to default, citing delays in “servicing of term loan obligations". Subsequently, Gensol termed it a temporary financial crunch and assured investors it would tide over these problems. The company’s shares closed at ₹262.25 on 13 March, down 67% from a year ago. The questionsThe close ties between the two firms have raised questions over corporate governance. “What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? What is the underlying security backing these loans?" asked Nitin Mangal, a Mumbai-based analyst who runs Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. Ltd, a Sebi-registered research firm. Gensol didn’t answer Mint’s questions on the nature of the loans given to Blu-Smart. “All material relationships between Gensol and BluSmart have been appropriately disclosed to both the Boards, the statutory auditors, lenders and the shareholders," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. Nonetheless, some large investors appear to be keeping a distance from the two firms given their close ties. “In our due diligence of Gensol, we saw the close ties. This was one of the reasons why we decided not to invest in the company," said the head of a Mumbai-based portfolio management services firm who didn’t want to be identified. The executive met with Anmol Jaggi and the senior management team in July 2021. What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? —Nitin Mangal Jaggi and his family owned 62.65% of Gensol (at the end of December 2024). Retail investors or individuals owning less than ₹2 lakh worth of shares owned about a fourth or 23.44%, while individuals owning more than ₹2 lakh worth of shares own 7.1% in the company. Non-resident Indians, corporate bodies and family offices own 5.44%. No foreign institutional investor, mutual fund or insurance company is an investor in Gensol. The Enforcement Directorate has taken control of the remaining 1.37% shares—they were previously owned by Hari Shankar Tibrewala, along with 13 other companies. This came in the aftermath of the financial crime investigation agency probing an alleged small-cap stock market manipulation fraud. A puzzling nature of the ties between Gensol and Blu-Smart is that even though Gensol describes transactions with Blu-Smart as ‘related-party transactions’, Blu-Smart hasn’t reported its financial ties with Gensol as ‘transactions with connected parties’ in its filings with the ministry of corporate affairs. “Gensol is a listed company. Transparency and trust are more important, and the audit committee chair, along with independent directors, should come clean and provide all information to investors," said V. Balakrishnan, a former chief financial officer at Infosys Ltd and founder of Exfinity Ventures, a venture capital fund. “All these transactions, including giving loans to Blu-Smart and Matrix Gas and Renewables ( ₹231.85 crore in loan in 2023-24), are reminiscent of how Vijay Mallya used the cash of the liquor business for the aviation business. The problematic issue in Gensol’s case is that the lease conditions under which Gensol is leasing out its cars to Blu-Smart have not been disclosed, and so minority shareholders of Gensol are the ones losing out," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd, a proxy advisory firm. Listing dreamsSuch disclosures are especially needed since Blu-Smart has listing dreams. Beginning September 2024, Blu-Smart has been looking to raise $50 million ( ₹418 crore) at a pre-money valuation of $335 million. It told investors it expects to go public in the second half of next year. Gensol’s current problems could cripple that plan of going public. It is important to mention that weeks before Gensol’s issues surfaced publicly, Blu-Smart defaulted on ₹30 crore worth of bonds—in early February. This brings us back to the transaction of Refex buying 2,997 cars from Gensol. Refex Industries is a Chennai-based public company that trades coal, handles ash, and manufactures and re-fills refrigerant gases. Refex Green buys 2,997 cars and immediately leases them to Blu-Smart Mobility. Why? “[W]e have acquired the vehicle from Gensol and we will be giving it to BluSmart only. So, for us, it will be a monthly payment of lease rental for these vehicles," Refex’s managing director Anil Jain told analysts in a post-earnings interaction dated 27 January. It is unknown whether Blu-Smart, which defaulted on a ₹30 crore bond last month, can service the contract with Refex. “This essentially is an asset (2,997 cars) and liability ( ₹315 crore loan) transaction through which Gensol is looking to clean up its book. Gensol could have sold these cars to Blu-Smart. But we don’t know the financial position of Blu-Smart, and for this reason, Refex steps in," said Mangal. A questionnaire sent to Refex’s chief financial officer, Dinesh Kumar Agarwal, went unanswered. Refex said it is buying these 2,997 cars at book value. At ₹315 crore, the average price of a car is ₹10.5 lakh. Book value is the difference between the cost of a car and the depreciation that has occurred over time. Most new electric vehicles sell between ₹10 and ₹15 lakh. Even assuming a 20% depreciation in the first year, it is unclear how Gensol and Refex arrived at ₹10.5 lakh for the cars running under the Blu-Smart brand. In addition, there is little clarity on whose loan Refex is taking over. There is no cash involved in the transaction—Refex takes on Gensol’s ₹315 crore loan. A spokesperson from Ireda told Mint that its loan to Gensol is not being transferred. Other creditors include Power Finance Corp. Ltd (loans of ₹334.8 crore); HDFC Bank Ltd ( ₹26.4 crore); Tata Motors Finance Ltd ( ₹18.3 crore); and Axis Bank Ltd ( ₹15 crore). It is unclear if Gensol and Refex have received approval from the creditors to transfer this loan. “The specific transaction is under the process of getting all necessary approvals," said a spokesperson from Blu-Smart. Anmol Jaggi’s plans to do things too fast (take on Uber and change the face of India’s cab hailing market) may have landed Gensol in a difficult spot for now, Subramanian of InGovern said. Jaggi founded Gensol in 2012 as a strategic advisory firm. By 2017, he started a solar engineering and procurement business. Two years later, in 2019, Gensol went public. The same year, Jaggi started a new business division, Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd, to finance EVs. Outside of Gensol, in 2019, Jaggi also set up Blu-Smart Mobility Ltd. First, let us examine Gensol’s EV lease business and Blu-Smart’s journey to understand the ties between the two firms better. Up until 2022, Gensol’s EV lease business was almost a non-starter. According to Gensol’s investor presentations, the business reported ₹4 crore in revenue in FY20; ₹3 crore in FY21, and ₹5 crore in FY22. By the end of March 2022, the EV business owned a little over 700 cars, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. According to the same executive, Blu-Smart started with 70 cars in 2019. In its early days, it received a $3 million investment from angel investors. By March 2021, it had 400 cars and hit an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 million. The number of cars on its platform more than doubled to 900 in FY22, when its ARR touched $8 million. Gensol’s EV business showed its first real growth in FY23 when it reported ₹41 crore in revenue, followed by ₹134 crore in FY24. Growth at Blu-Smart also picked up during this time.

According to this investor presentation, Blu-Smart had 8,000 cars as on 31 September 2024. Gensol, meanwhile, didn’t tell Mint how many cars it owns overall, limiting its commentary to the transaction it inked with Refex in January this year. “Gensol is the owner of these 2,997 cars and post the transaction, Refex would be leasing the same vehicles to BluSmart," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. “Gensol Engineering Ltd (GEL), was an early supporter of BluSmart’s EV mission and as BluSmart has increased its presence, multiple more lessors have now leased vehicles to BluSmart," the spokesperson added. Apart from Gensol (which owns over 87% or about 7,000 of Blu-Smart’s fleet), other leasers include state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd and Quiklyz, the vehicle leasing and subscription business of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. The loansGensol buys cars, leases them to Blu-Smart, and tops it up with more loans to the private cab-hailing company. The important thing which has not been reported until now is that Gensol spent ₹568 crore in the three years to March 2024 to buy electric cars, according to a review of the company’s annual reports by Mint. In FY24 alone, Gensol spent ₹352.14 crore to buy cars. Gensol granted ₹148.33 crore as loans to three Blu-Smart subsidiaries in the year ended March 2024: Blu-Smart Fleet Pvt. Ltd received ₹138.87 crore while Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd and Blu-Smart Mobility Tech Pvt. Ltd received ₹9.19 crore and ₹0.27 crore, respectively. Simply put, Gensol spent over ₹500 crore last year to build Blu-Smart, considering that most of the cars bought by the firm in 2024 ( ₹352.14 crore) were also leased to the ride hailing firm. This is not a small amount considering that on 3 March, Care Ratings Ltd downgraded Gensol’s ₹716 crore bank loan to default, citing delays in “servicing of term loan obligations". Subsequently, Gensol termed it a temporary financial crunch and assured investors it would tide over these problems. The company’s shares closed at ₹262.25 on 13 March, down 67% from a year ago. The questionsThe close ties between the two firms have raised questions over corporate governance. “What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? What is the underlying security backing these loans?" asked Nitin Mangal, a Mumbai-based analyst who runs Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. Ltd, a Sebi-registered research firm. Gensol didn’t answer Mint’s questions on the nature of the loans given to Blu-Smart. “All material relationships between Gensol and BluSmart have been appropriately disclosed to both the Boards, the statutory auditors, lenders and the shareholders," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. Nonetheless, some large investors appear to be keeping a distance from the two firms given their close ties. “In our due diligence of Gensol, we saw the close ties. This was one of the reasons why we decided not to invest in the company," said the head of a Mumbai-based portfolio management services firm who didn’t want to be identified. The executive met with Anmol Jaggi and the senior management team in July 2021. What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? —Nitin Mangal Jaggi and his family owned 62.65% of Gensol (at the end of December 2024). Retail investors or individuals owning less than ₹2 lakh worth of shares owned about a fourth or 23.44%, while individuals owning more than ₹2 lakh worth of shares own 7.1% in the company. Non-resident Indians, corporate bodies and family offices own 5.44%. No foreign institutional investor, mutual fund or insurance company is an investor in Gensol. The Enforcement Directorate has taken control of the remaining 1.37% shares—they were previously owned by Hari Shankar Tibrewala, along with 13 other companies. This came in the aftermath of the financial crime investigation agency probing an alleged small-cap stock market manipulation fraud. A puzzling nature of the ties between Gensol and Blu-Smart is that even though Gensol describes transactions with Blu-Smart as ‘related-party transactions’, Blu-Smart hasn’t reported its financial ties with Gensol as ‘transactions with connected parties’ in its filings with the ministry of corporate affairs. “Gensol is a listed company. Transparency and trust are more important, and the audit committee chair, along with independent directors, should come clean and provide all information to investors," said V. Balakrishnan, a former chief financial officer at Infosys Ltd and founder of Exfinity Ventures, a venture capital fund. “All these transactions, including giving loans to Blu-Smart and Matrix Gas and Renewables ( ₹231.85 crore in loan in 2023-24), are reminiscent of how Vijay Mallya used the cash of the liquor business for the aviation business. The problematic issue in Gensol’s case is that the lease conditions under which Gensol is leasing out its cars to Blu-Smart have not been disclosed, and so minority shareholders of Gensol are the ones losing out," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd, a proxy advisory firm. Listing dreamsSuch disclosures are especially needed since Blu-Smart has listing dreams. Beginning September 2024, Blu-Smart has been looking to raise $50 million ( ₹418 crore) at a pre-money valuation of $335 million. It told investors it expects to go public in the second half of next year. Gensol’s current problems could cripple that plan of going public. It is important to mention that weeks before Gensol’s issues surfaced publicly, Blu-Smart defaulted on ₹30 crore worth of bonds—in early February. This brings us back to the transaction of Refex buying 2,997 cars from Gensol. Refex Industries is a Chennai-based public company that trades coal, handles ash, and manufactures and re-fills refrigerant gases. Refex Green buys 2,997 cars and immediately leases them to Blu-Smart Mobility. Why? “[W]e have acquired the vehicle from Gensol and we will be giving it to BluSmart only. So, for us, it will be a monthly payment of lease rental for these vehicles," Refex’s managing director Anil Jain told analysts in a post-earnings interaction dated 27 January. It is unknown whether Blu-Smart, which defaulted on a ₹30 crore bond last month, can service the contract with Refex. “This essentially is an asset (2,997 cars) and liability ( ₹315 crore loan) transaction through which Gensol is looking to clean up its book. Gensol could have sold these cars to Blu-Smart. But we don’t know the financial position of Blu-Smart, and for this reason, Refex steps in," said Mangal. A questionnaire sent to Refex’s chief financial officer, Dinesh Kumar Agarwal, went unanswered. Refex said it is buying these 2,997 cars at book value. At ₹315 crore, the average price of a car is ₹10.5 lakh. Book value is the difference between the cost of a car and the depreciation that has occurred over time. Most new electric vehicles sell between ₹10 and ₹15 lakh. Even assuming a 20% depreciation in the first year, it is unclear how Gensol and Refex arrived at ₹10.5 lakh for the cars running under the Blu-Smart brand. In addition, there is little clarity on whose loan Refex is taking over. There is no cash involved in the transaction—Refex takes on Gensol’s ₹315 crore loan. A spokesperson from Ireda told Mint that its loan to Gensol is not being transferred. Other creditors include Power Finance Corp. Ltd (loans of ₹334.8 crore); HDFC Bank Ltd ( ₹26.4 crore); Tata Motors Finance Ltd ( ₹18.3 crore); and Axis Bank Ltd ( ₹15 crore). It is unclear if Gensol and Refex have received approval from the creditors to transfer this loan. “The specific transaction is under the process of getting all necessary approvals," said a spokesperson from Blu-Smart. Anmol Jaggi’s plans to do things too fast (take on Uber and change the face of India’s cab hailing market) may have landed Gensol in a difficult spot for now, Subramanian of InGovern said. Gensol buys cars, leases them to Blu-Smart, and tops it up with more loans to the private cab-hailing company.

(Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Last week, the S&P 500 hit correction territory, which is defined as a 10% decline from a previous high. Stocks rebounded on Friday. So, the S&P 500 sits a little over 8% below its mid-February high, including the more than 2% decline last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of almost 18% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks seems to come from an economic growth scare, which includes plunging consumer confidence, with additional fuel provided by the policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns While some hard data has shown some cracks, the weaker economic data seems to come primarily from soft data, like consumer confidence data. Last Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest reading since November 2022. Survey data can be unreliable, though, as consumers often do differently than they say. For example, in 2022, the reading fell well below current levels without triggering a recession. Looking at past periods of depressed consumer sentiment, buying the S&P 500 every time the index fell below 65 led to an average of an 8.4% return over the next 12 months. If you miraculously could forecast the low in consumer sentiment for each cycle, the robust return was an average of 19%, with no losses for a holding period of 12 months. Using 2022 as an example, the consumer sentiment index fell below 65 in February, but buying then would have been too early since the S&P 500 lost another 9.2% in the 12 months following. However, the economy did not fall into contraction, and consumer sentiment hit its low in June, with the S&P 500 posting a 17.6% gain over the next 12 months. Consumer Sentiment Notably, political affiliation seems to be significantly impacting the consumer sentiment index. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Donald Trump’s election. This trend is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during some of former President Joe Biden’s term. Last Friday’s results did show a decline in Republican sentiment, so this could become similar to 2022. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party Trump’s use of tariffs has added to the uncertainty surrounding policy. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. Given the tariff and DOGE headlines, it is probably not surprising that their U.S. policy uncertainty index is elevated. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas, stocks tend to do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. This is entirely consistent with the consumer sentiment data discussed previously, which shows that poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen. Still, the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high last Thursday, stocks officially entered a correction. This leaves investors asking whether it will get worse before it gets better. History can help gauge the risks. Looking at 21 U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism from this point. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After Stock Correction Looking at the data through the lens of batting average, stocks have been higher in the 12 months following a correction 81% of the time. If there was no recession, the success rate rose to 93% of the occurrences. As one might expect, a recession around the time of the correction causes worse outcomes, with a positive result only 57% of the time. Percentage Of Positive Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction It can also be helpful to look at the range of outcomes when assessing the risks after a correction. Remember that this data includes two brutal bear markets, 2000 and 2007. The tech bubble burst in 2000, sending the S&P 500 down by almost 50%. Not to be outdone, the 2007 global financial crisis saw stock prices decline by over 56%. Not surprisingly, the worst outcome in the 12 months following a correction was in the 2007 bear market, in which the S&P 500 fell another 34.8% after the initial correction and featured a recession beginning in December 2007. The best outcome was relatively recent in 2023. It followed a 2023 correction, which came on the heels of a growth scare and bear market in 2022, so when the recession was avoided and earnings rebounded, stock soared. Range Of Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction Since some of this market weakness stems from economic fears, Monday's February retail sales will be an important barometer. Consumer spending is crucial to U.S. economic growth, and January retail sales fell month-over-month. As noted, most of the weaker economic data has been of the soft variety, like consumer sentiment. Two months of tepid retail sales in a row would raise concerns about the durability of the consumer. Retail sales are inexorably linked with employment since income generally drives the ability to spend. Cracks are beginning to show in the employment picture. So, there are downside risks, but retail sales should see some increase month-over-month for February. Consumer Spending & Jobs As the growth scare unfolded and policy uncertainty increased, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to between two and three cuts, with the first cut expected in mid-June. The Fed meets on Wednesday, and while no changes to monetary policy are expected, Chair Jerome Powell’s statements will be closely followed. Markets will be keen to judge the timing of the next cut and the committee’s views on inflation and the health of the U.S. economy. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts There are no sure things when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks. For example, one thing we can learn from the past is that dreadful consumer confidence, high policy uncertainty, and stock market corrections don’t automatically spell doom for the future of stock returns. Long-term, stocks have been the best-performing investment, with an annualized return of 9.9%. The price for this ability to outrun inflation by a sizable margin and compound wealth has been periods of painful and unforeseeable declines. Recent stock declines reinforce the timeless advice to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term expenses. While stocks compound wealth over long periods, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, making them unreliable for short-term liability needs. Unlike in recent years with ultra-low bond yields, high-quality bonds have returned to their historical function of providing income and a safe haven as stocks and other risk assets have declined. Holding a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses can help cushion the impact of any stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to ride out stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership.

(Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Last week, the S&P 500 hit correction territory, which is defined as a 10% decline from a previous high. Stocks rebounded on Friday. So, the S&P 500 sits a little over 8% below its mid-February high, including the more than 2% decline last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of almost 18% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks seems to come from an economic growth scare, which includes plunging consumer confidence, with additional fuel provided by the policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns While some hard data has shown some cracks, the weaker economic data seems to come primarily from soft data, like consumer confidence data. Last Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest reading since November 2022. Survey data can be unreliable, though, as consumers often do differently than they say. For example, in 2022, the reading fell well below current levels without triggering a recession. Looking at past periods of depressed consumer sentiment, buying the S&P 500 every time the index fell below 65 led to an average of an 8.4% return over the next 12 months. If you miraculously could forecast the low in consumer sentiment for each cycle, the robust return was an average of 19%, with no losses for a holding period of 12 months. Using 2022 as an example, the consumer sentiment index fell below 65 in February, but buying then would have been too early since the S&P 500 lost another 9.2% in the 12 months following. However, the economy did not fall into contraction, and consumer sentiment hit its low in June, with the S&P 500 posting a 17.6% gain over the next 12 months. Consumer Sentiment Notably, political affiliation seems to be significantly impacting the consumer sentiment index. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Donald Trump’s election. This trend is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during some of former President Joe Biden’s term. Last Friday’s results did show a decline in Republican sentiment, so this could become similar to 2022. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party Trump’s use of tariffs has added to the uncertainty surrounding policy. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. Given the tariff and DOGE headlines, it is probably not surprising that their U.S. policy uncertainty index is elevated. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas, stocks tend to do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. This is entirely consistent with the consumer sentiment data discussed previously, which shows that poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen. Still, the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high last Thursday, stocks officially entered a correction. This leaves investors asking whether it will get worse before it gets better. History can help gauge the risks. Looking at 21 U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism from this point. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After Stock Correction Looking at the data through the lens of batting average, stocks have been higher in the 12 months following a correction 81% of the time. If there was no recession, the success rate rose to 93% of the occurrences. As one might expect, a recession around the time of the correction causes worse outcomes, with a positive result only 57% of the time.

Title: On the anniversary of the dot-com bubble bursting, is history repeating itself?

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. What would you do if you won $10 million? The winner of MrBeast's "Beast Games" told us he immediately started estate planning and exploring tax strategies. On the agenda today: But first: 25 years since the bubble burst. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The sheer timing of the market's recent sell-off has an eerie precedent. As my colleague Matthew Fox reports, this month marks the 25th anniversary of the peak of the dot-com bubble. Back then, a burgeoning technology called the World Wide Web lit a fire under the markets. Stock valuations soared to dizzying levels. The boom times eventually gave way to an epic bust. In March 2000, the party stopped. The tech-heavy Nasdaq would lose nearly 80% of its value over the next few years. There are parallels between then and now. Today's AI mania looks much like the internet excitement of the late 1990s. Yet few expect a similar decline this time around. The IPO market is dormant and deal activity hasn't picked up. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO, told BI's Fox that the stock market is nowhere near a bubble. "In a bubble, everybody makes money," Belski said. Regardless, the market's high-fliers have been hit hard. Tesla has lost roughly half its value and warned the Trump administration that it could suffer from increased costs due to a trade war. Shares of Nvidia and Apple are teetering and the so-called Magnificent 7 suddenly doesn't look so magnificent anymore. While Trump's trade policies have fueled much of the market's recent declines, the Trump administration doesn't seem too perturbed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Thursday that the White House is unconcerned about "a little" market volatility. That isn't a ringing endorsement of things turning around anytime soon. Friday's rally alleviated some concerns and pulled the S&P 500 out of correction territory. But it is still in the red for the year. Here's to hoping we're not headed for dot-com déjà vu. Has the market sell-off gone too far? Or do you expect it to go down even more? Let me know your thoughts: today@businessinsider.com. Read the full story. Amazon's five-day return-to-office hit some speedbumps early on, with reports of office theft, a shortage of desks, and overflowing parking lots. Ten weeks into the rollout, we're checking in with Amazon employees across corporate departments and the country to see how they've adjusted. Eleven people told us their experiences, which ranged from energized and connected to depressed and demoralized. Plus, two employees explained why they left. Even before the stock market's whirlwind week, recession fears had been gripping Wall Street. BI spoke to financial planners who shared what you can do now to prepare for a possible recession. Their biggest advice? Do not panic. Fear can be a powerful motivator to take drastic measures. And if you haven't already, now is the time to build your emergency fund. Actions you can take now. Layoffs are the new normal in Big Tech, but is turning up the heat on "low performers" really the best strategy? Research says otherwise. Demanding versus demeaning — BI's Aki Ito doesn't think every tech exec is getting it right. Why firing them doesn't "raise the bar." Private equity is one of the most sought-after careers in the finance industry. These firms are increasingly driving the world of corporate dealmaking as investors flock to the sector. BI pulled publicly available data for 12 firms, including Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR. Salaries for entry-level analysts start at $100,000, and for partners and managing directors, those salaries can soar up to $500,000. How much those in PE make. This week's quote: "No one in America should feel threatened or targeted simply for driving a vehicle." — A Cybertruck owner spoke to BI about facing growing hostility and verbal harassment. More of this week's top reads: A photographer took a shot of Trump's notes — and they read like a Tesla sales pitch. The BI Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Blockchain fragmentation and Ethereum's network challenges highlight Bitcoin's enduring appeal as a store of value. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post from Shane Neagle, Editor In Chief from The Tokenist. Since the introduction of altcoins, after Bitcoin paved the road for them, we have seen many projects give 10x gains in relatively short periods. It has also been accepted that the crypto space oscillates between altcoin and bitcoin seasons, suggesting more investing opportunities down the line. A deluge of memecoins flooded the market as well, serving as a more robust gambling system (compared to online casinos). As crypto space lost $530 billion market cap over the last 30 days, it is prudent to examine its fundamentals once again. Is such a concept as ‘altcoin season’ meaningful moving forward? Is there more to cryptos than cyclical speculation? To answer those questions, we must first remind ourselves of narratives past. During the evolution of the crypto space, Bitcoin became de-facto the only proof-of-work digital asset worth considering, following Ethereum’s The Merge in September 2022. As a transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), The Merge represents a cleavage in blockchain philosophies. While Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) requires computational resources, Ethereum’s PoS eliminates such barriers in order to boost transaction speed and efficiency. In other words, Bitcoin further differentiated itself as a store of value, while Ethereum focused more on cost-effective blockchain utility. At first glance, this may seem perfectly complementary, but there are several underlying problems that eventually reared their heads. Altogether, the PoW-PoS bifurcation translates into PoS fragmentation. If PoS-based assets, and PoS-based platforms competitive to Ethereum, are more reproducible, they can be launched with minimal upfront costs. With this foundation, there is no single altcoin asset to cling onto. Ultimately, with a low barrier of entry, this led to the fragmentation of the crypto market across +34,000 digital assets. From the Bitcoin-Ethereum perspective, as the two largest digital assets by market cap, PoS-led fragmentation manifests as a corrosive effect on Ethereum price level. To put it differently, Bitcoin’s key features, PoW and scarcity, are reinforcing Bitcoin fundamentals. In contrast, Ethereum suffers from network effect erosion from competing PoS chains, which offer similar functionality and incentive structure. Moreover, the increased complexity outside of Bitcoin is creating a barrier to entry from new capital inflows. Who can spend time filtering thousands of assets and bet that they will have staying power beyond one year? Even sophisticated investors leveraging popular futures trading algorithms often struggle to navigate the fragmented market effectively. In fact, this is precisely why memecoin mania gained traction. The complexity and fragmentation of the crypto market lends itself to thinking of digital assets outside their fundamentals. Instead, focus is then on celebrity endorsements, humor, viral marketing, which often turns into pump-and-dump schemes. Inevitably, this creates a negative feedback loop: But there is an even greater problem than that. Let’s assume that this negative feedback loop created by memecoins doesn’t exist. One has to consider if there even is a market for blockchain based solutions, as it was previously imagined. Through anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, governments around the world have expended great efforts to subdue the crypto ecosystem. Let’s quickly remind ourselves of key promises before regulative sweeps took place: Decentralization as elimination of intermediaries – nearly everything is now intermediated through fiat rails, including transfers from self-custodial wallets. Financial inclusion as access for the unbanked/underbanked – it is still more convenient to use legacy banking than blockchain tech, which is inherently complex and requires digital literacy. According to the latest EMarketer report, cryptocurrency payment penetration is hitting a wall. Although the number of crypto payment users is expected to rise by 82.1% from 2024 to 2026, this is from a tiny overall population base of only 2.6%. It may very well end up being the case that a digital dollar, a stablecoin like USDT, will subsume this effort entirely in place of a direct CBDC. Censorship resistance as a guarantee that transactions cannot be reversed or intercepted by governments and organizations. Governments regularly pursue innovative mechanisms to cancel such efforts, from debanking to the persecution of smart contract developers. Although Treasury sanctions against Tornado Cash were overturned in January, there is little indication that financial privacy will become a human right any time soon. In fact, indicators point in the other direction. 🚨 BREAKING: The ECB’s Digital Euro is set to launch in October. Key concerns include: – Real-time transaction tracking – Potential for payment blocking – Automatic tax deductions – Restrictions on cash withdrawals – Programmable money with expiration dates They couldn’t… pic.twitter.com/UvQH750gbl — Dr. Simon Goddek (@goddeketal) March 9, 2025 Altogether, this friction between blockchain-led solutions and governments leads to a contained market. And if a blockchain-based solution should be deployed, it will be under governments’ terms. Lastly, the entire concept of Web3 is dubious as a decentralized, blockchain-based iteration of the internet. Elon Musk’s DOGE revelations in the case of USAID funding clearly point to great efforts to push narratives, control narratives, suppress and de-legitimize dissent. A semantic, censorship-resistant Web3 is fundamentally at odds with governments’ needs to maintain authority and legitimacy as they push various agendas. To think that established information proliferation nodes such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook would be allowed to erode in favor of Web3 would be foolhardy. Any government needs centralized nodes to maintain power. This was amply demonstrated in the case of the TikTok ban. Although this video reels app is vastly superior to YouTube shorts, a leverage was pulled to sanitize it and make it less relevant. Again, this is another factor that contains the blockchain space to a micro-niche instead of propelling it into mainstream expansion. With this in mind, blockchain space is still worthy of engagement. Bitcoin will likely remain the main focus of crypto investing, owing to its unique, PoW-based network effect. Although the recent White House Crypto Summit was less bullish than expected, it was still positive in the long run. The decision to use seized bitcoins effectively removed this sell pressure from the table. Likewise, President Trump seems to be serious about ending the “war on crypto”. But looking at the crypto space from a purely innovative solutions perspective, which projects should retail investors consider during steep discounts? These five tokens should be considered as long play exposure during crypto market deflation. After all, it is unlikely that AI narrative will subside any time soon. In terms of top 10 revenue-generation chains during the market slump, crypto activity is clearly on the side of low-friction payment chains (Tron) and general purpose, high-performing chains (Solana, Avalanche). Ethereum still maintains high ranking due to its large market share within the DeFi ecosystem. In conclusion, what should crypto investors keep in mind moving forward? Due to inherent friction with governments, digital assets are unlikely to ever penetrate mainstream to a significant extent. But within the contained ecosystem, investors should focus on long term narratives – AI, infrastructure and chain performance. A truly decentralized Web3 should be understood as a niche play that will be countered by deep pockets of Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), as centralized node extensions of the USG. By the same token, retail investors would do well to expose themselves to their stock options as safer bets.

And if a blockchain-based solution should be deployed, it will be under governments’ terms. Lastly, the entire concept of Web3 is dubious as a decentralized, blockchain-based iteration of the internet. Elon Musk’s DOGE revelations in the case of USAID funding clearly point to great efforts to push narratives, control narratives, suppress and de-legitimize dissent. A semantic, censorship-resistant Web3 is fundamentally at odds with governments’ needs to maintain authority and legitimacy as they push various agendas. To think that established information proliferation nodes such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook would be allowed to erode in favor of Web3 would be foolhardy. Any government needs centralized nodes to maintain power. This was amply demonstrated in the case of the TikTok ban. Although this video reels app is vastly superior to YouTube shorts, a leverage was pulled to sanitize it and make it less relevant. Again, this is another factor that contains the blockchain space to a micro-niche instead of propelling it into mainstream expansion. With this in mind, blockchain space is still worthy of engagement. Bitcoin will likely remain the main focus of crypto investing, owing to its unique, PoW-based network effect. Although the recent White House Crypto Summit was less bullish than expected, it was still positive in the long run. The decision to use seized bitcoins effectively removed this sell pressure from the table. Likewise, President Trump seems to be serious about ending the “war on crypto”. But looking at the crypto space from a purely innovative solutions perspective, which projects should retail investors consider during steep discounts? These five tokens should be considered as long play exposure during crypto market deflation. After all, it is unlikely that AI narrative will subside any time soon. In terms of top 10 revenue-generation chains during the market slump, crypto activity is clearly on the side of low-friction payment chains (Tron) and general purpose, high-performing chains (Solana, Avalanche). Ethereum still maintains high ranking due to its large market share within the DeFi ecosystem. In conclusion, what should crypto investors keep in mind moving forward? Due to inherent friction with governments, digital assets are unlikely to ever penetrate mainstream to a significant extent. But within the contained ecosystem, investors should focus on long term narratives – AI, infrastructure and chain performance. A truly decentralized Web3 should be understood as a niche play that will be countered by deep pockets of Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), as centralized node extensions of the USG. By the same token, retail investors would do well to expose themselves to their stock options as safer bets.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day.

Title: The Dark MAGA Gov-Corp Technate — Part 2

Time Published: 2025-03-15T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Tech Iain Davis, Independent media alliance, Unlimited Hangout In continuing to unpack the ideologies of the oligarchs who are part of the new Trump administration, Iain Davis examines how their ideas are being translated into policy. He considers the consequent infrastructure rollout that is preparing the US and the world for an imminent Gov-corp Technate within a multipolar world. In Part 1 of this series, we explored the political philosophies that have long been adopted and promoted by Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and considered the implications, given both men’s obvious influence on the Trump administration. Musk is a high-profile advocate of Technocracy, and Peter Thiel is an accelerationist neoreactionary who favours, in particular, the Dark Enlightenment. Before you read this article (Part 2), I urge you to familiarise yourself with the explanations of Technocracy and the NRx (the neoreactionary movement) provided in Part 1. Otherwise, many of the references here will lack context. As we noted in Part 1, Thiel and Musk are part of the oligarchic class by virtue of being invited to join a network led by other oligarchs whose stratospheric wealth far surpasses that of the names published on the “richest people in the world” lists. Welcomed into their exclusive club, Thiel and Musk are made men. In Part 2, we will explore how the political philosophies and the associated economic theories of Thiel and Musk are shaping public policy. Keep in mind that these two men are far from alone in attempting to create an American gov-corp Technate. Although they borrow some libertarian ideas, there is nothing truly “libertarian” about either technocrats or accelerationist neoreactionaries. Their convoluted theories, once applied, could not be more authoritarian, more anti-liberty. Just as it is an oxymoron to describe Musk as a “libertarian technocrat,” so is it absurd to think of Peter Thiel as an “anarcho-capitalist.” Yet propagandists persist in encouraging us to see them in these terms. Witness a 2014 article in The Atlantic titled “The Libertarian Capitalist’s Case for State Power and Making No Money.” It is possible that people like Thiel and Musk self-identify as libertarians because they think “liberty” means freedom granted by — and to — the oligarchy. In Part 1, we referenced the Venetian Republic. The Doge of Venice was the ruler of the banking, finance, and commercial empire of the Venetian Republic. That is to say, the Doge was given the liberty to rule by the oligarchs of the day. We might wonder if the naming of the Department of Government Efficiency (the DOGE) that Musk leads deliberately references the Venetian magistrate. Some say it does, while others suggest another possibility. Created as a joke in 2013 by cryptographers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, the Dogecoin, a memecoin, has seen its price and market cap soar and fluctuate wildly thanks in no small measure to Elon Musk’s comments about it. Much of Musk’s talk about Dogecoin has been deliberately provocative. For example, in 2019 he declared himself the “former CEO of Dogecoin,” though that was never the case. His social media posts alone have provoked major changes in the price of Dogecoin. Musk has also aggressively hiked its value by, for instance, hinting it might become the basis of the proposed “X pay” payment system on his newly acquired ‘X’ platform — formerly Twitter. Musk encouraged bullish investment in Dogecoin. Of course, just because someone encourages you to do something that doesn’t negate your personal responsibility to conduct due diligence. When some investors lost their shirts, as Dogecoin prices tumbled, they tried to sue Musk in 2022 with a potential $258 billion class action lawsuit. The case was dismissed last year. The judge ruled that Musk’s comments were just “aspirational and puffery, not factual and susceptible to being falsified.” Though it is worth noting the offhand comments of one man took the Dogecoin from a literal joke — a crypto parody — to achieving a market capitalisation of $14.5 billion in 2021. If there is an in-joke to the naming of the DOGE, nominally led by Elon Musk, some argue it is Musk’s fondness for the Dogecoin that is reflected in the D.O.G.E acronym. Yet, the symbolism of “the Doge ”— one who is granted the liberty to rule by oligarchs — is perhaps more conspicuous. Just as with the term “Accelerator” — meaning high-impact investment to accelerate the growth of a startup — an obvious underpinning ideology is implied, even if rarely discussed. In the introduction to his 2012 treatise, “The Dark Enlightenment,” political philosopher Nick Land highlighted the importance of an article written three years earlier by oligarch Thiel. Land wrote: One milestone was the April 2009 discussion hosted at Cato Unbound among libertarian thinkers (including Patri Friedman and Peter Thiel) in which disillusionment with the direction and possibilities of democratic politics was expressed with unusual forthrightness. Thiel summarized the trend bluntly: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” In a related article Thiel penned, titled “The Education of a Libertarian,” he was describing himself, and yet the personal philosophy he outlined in it was pure accelerationist neoreactionism. Thiel opined that “the prospects for a libertarian politics appear grim indeed,” given that the government’s response to every crisis was “more government.” He also claimed that the post-WWI deflationary depression in Western nations was the last “sharp but short” shock to have allowed the alleged advantages of Schumpeterian “creative destruction” to flourish. After that depression, he said, so-called “democratic” politics had stifled the opportunities to capitalise on crises. As a result, Thiel said he no longer believed “that politics encompasses all possible futures of our world.” Asserting, in so many words, that democracies were useless, Thiel announced he had found a new life goal: In our time, the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms — from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called “social democracy.” The critical question then becomes one of means, of how to escape not via politics but beyond it. For Thiel, the “unthinking demos” is us: the holders of the “neo-puritan faith” in progressive “social democracy” — the acolytes of the Cathedral (and the people whom Nick Land considers “inarticulate proles”). In Thiel’s view, we must embrace our “technoplastic” future, become intelligible, move beyond politics, and liberate capitalist innovation by swearing fealty to the gov-corp model. To this end, Thiel identified three “technological frontiers” upon which he could construct his darkly enlightened aristocracy.[1] Cyberspace was the first frontier he identified. There, Thiel focused on creating “a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution.” Cyberspace would enable “new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states” — and would result in a new world that would “force change on the existing social and political order.” [2] Outer space would be another Thiel frontier, where the “libertarian future of classic science fiction” could be built. [3] Seasteading would be his interim frontier, where the unclaimed oceans could be settled by humans. He called seasteading “more tentative than the Internet, but much more realistic than space travel.” Seasteading would at least give us the time to develop the outer-space ideas on earth, prior to colonising the stars. These frontiers are necessary, Thiel insisted, because “we are in a deadly race between politics and technology.” He concluded: We do not know exactly how close this race is, but I suspect that it may be very close, even down to the wire. Unlike the world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of individuals may still be paramount. The fate of our world may depend on the effort of a single person [Trump?] who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism. [Emphasis added.] Between 2006 and 2012, Thiel was instrumental in organising the Singularity Summits convened by the Machine Intelligence Research Institute — originally the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI) — in partnership with Stanford University. Thiel provided much of the funding. Thiel cannot be both an advocate of accelerationist neoreaction and simultaneously an anarcho-capitalist — a libertarian. The two philosophies are mutually exclusive. In Part 1, we noted the technocrats’ rejection of the notion that “all men are created equal.” In a similar vein, Land, Yarvin, Fisher, and other accelerationists consider it essential to have a ruling entity, which can only be comprised of a few human beings exercising an unequal, additional right to rule. Both the technocrats and the accelerationists fundamentally misunderstand, or misinterpret, what the Preamble to The Declaration of Independence means. They completely ignore the second clause of the relevant declaration — namely, “that they [human beings] are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” “Equality,” in real libertarian thinking, does not infer a held belief that everyone is the same — though that is certainly how technocrats interpret the word. Libertarian “equality” doesn’t deny that people have relative strengths and weaknesses. It is not a rejection of either leadership or possible forms of meritocracy. It self-evidently means that every human being has an equal right to “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” These rights are unalienable — or inalienable. Our rights are not decided for us by others or limited by others, and no one on earth has any more or any fewer “equal rights” than anyone else. This idea is not difficult to grasp. It is central to the political philosophy of anarcho-capitalism, as clearly enunciated by Murray Rothbard (1926–1995): [N]o man or group of men may aggress against the person or property of anyone else. This may be called the “nonaggression axiom.” “Aggression” is defined as the initiation of the use or threat of physical violence against the person or property of anyone else. Anarcho-capitalism wholeheartedly rejects the initiation of the use of force — the aggressive imposition of claimed authority — by the state to coerce individual persons or seize their property. An example is the threat of fining or imprisoning someone who hasn’t paid taxes to the “proper” authorities. Anarcho-capitalism resoundingly rejects the state and all its dictatorial demands. By contrast, the proponents of Technocracy and the proponents of the Dark Enlightenment, such as Musk and Thiel, are not interested in restricting state power, though they may say otherwise. Instead they wish to move the state from the public to the private sector and expand its power once sufficiently privatized. True, they oppose “representative democracy” and characterise it as both a “democracy” (which it isn’t) and a bureaucratic system riddled with problems (which it is), but the solutions they offer, to all intents and purposes, magnify the power of the very state they supposedly condemn. What the believers in Technocracy and the believers in the Dark Enlightenment both propose are compartmentalised, hierarchical sociopolitical power structures that couldn’t be more state-like or more authoritarian. They seek to expand and maximise the power of the state, though in slightly different ways. Calling their new model of the state either a Technate (as technocrats do) or a gov-corp (as accelerationist neoreactionaries do) doesn’t change the nature of the tyrannical statism they desire to foist on the rest of us. The term “technopopulism,” coined by political theorists Christopher Bickerton and Carlo Accetti, has increasingly been bandied about. While the US voters who elected Trump were offered technopopulist promises, this was clearly a sales pitch to entice them to support a gov-corp Technate. “Populism” can be broadly defined as a political attempt to “appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups.” “Technocracy” is commonly said to mean “a government or social system that is controlled or influenced by experts in science or technology.” Neither left-wing nor right-wing, technopopulism promises a new kind of politics based on the belief that the more limited role of elected politicians is to put the appropriate teams of experts together to guide policy and to find technological solutions to social and economic problems, thereby benefiting “ordinary people.” But the apparent technopopulist offer to retain democratic accountability in the US is a deceit. The technopopulists say they want to unleash “technocracy” — with a small “t” — for the public good. But the new government system they propose is constructing “Technocracy” — with a big “T” — to serve the interests of the “American elites.” This is evident from The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 (aka The 2025 Presidential Transition Project), Promise to America. It claims its purpose is to “defang and defund the woke culture warriors who have infiltrated every last institution in America.” While defanging and defunding woke warriors holds allure for American voters, the Project 2025 methodology actually subverts US “representative democracy.” The Trump administration is evidently closely allied with Project 2025 — denials notwithstanding. One such obvious tie: Trump has nominated Russell Vought to return to the post of director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and, by no coincidence, Vought was a key figure in convening the Project 2025 initiative. Project 2025 contributors were influential in Trump’s first administration and are no less conspicuous in his current picks for office. Project 2025 sets a presidential agenda for the first 180 days in office that seeks to empower the executive branch to meet these key goals: dramatically reduce the size of the public sector bureaucracy; privatise and deregulate the functions of the state; and liberate American technological innovation by “shuttering” it off from the China tech sector’s alleged infiltration. Thus, according to Project 2025, US technology can, if applied properly, be used to resolve all manner of social problems—from anti-American inequality of opportunity in the education system to woke propaganda infesting the media. In other words, American technology produced by Americans and for Americans can supply every long-sought answer to America’s ills. The power of American AI can be set free to, for example, police social media and tackle abuses such as Medicare fraud. Project 2025 offers the additional justification that the US is in an AI arms race with China and, therefore, must invest in AI accordingly. Trump issued a slew of executive orders following his inauguration. These days, this is not an unusual practice for an incoming US president. However, Trump’s EOs were clearly heavily influenced by Project 2025. Ironically, The Heritage Foundation and its Project 2025 are bankrolled by some of the “elites” the project accuses of betraying Americans. The Coors, Koch, Uihlein, Barre Seid, Bradley, and Scaiffe families are among the financial backers of both the Foundation and Project 2025. Rather than technopopulists it is the “TechnoKings” (see Part 1) who have been “assisting” Trumps selection of his administration’s personnel. Musk’s influence is well known but Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, is another influencer. Andreessen has not just been involved in making Trump’s picks for technology and economic related positions — areas where he perhaps has some expertise — but also for US defense and intelligence posts. Andreessen’s Machiavellian reasons for supporting Trump are obvious. As reported by the Verge, in July 2024 Andreessen spelled out that he and his partners were backing Trump, not because they shared any of the concerns voiced by Republican voters, but because they could use the Trump administration to deliver the regulatory environment they wanted for their project to succeed. That project is a gov-corp Technate. Not technopopulism but Techno-Optimism. In 2023, Marc Andreessen published The Techno-Optimist Manifesto. He explained precisely why he and his TechKing partners have seized their opportunity: We can advance to a far superior way of living, and of being. [. . .] We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology. [. . .] We have a problem of poverty, so we invent technology to create abundance. Give us a real world problem, and we can invent technology that will solve it. [. . .] Combine technology and markets and you get what Nick Land has termed the techno-capital machine, the engine of perpetual material creation, growth, and abundance.[. . .] We believe in accelerationism – the conscious and deliberate propulsion of technological development – to [. . .] ensure the techno-capital upward spiral continues forever. [. . .] We believe intelligence is in an upward spiral, [. . .] as people form symbiotic relationships with machines into new cybernetic systems. [. . .] We believe Artificial Intelligence is our alchemy, our Philosopher’s Stone. [. . .] We believe in Augmented Intelligence just as much as we believe in Artificial Intelligence. Intelligent machines augment intelligent humans, driving a geometric expansion of what humans can do. This is pure accelerationist neoreaction strongly influence by Technocracy. It is Nick Land and notably not Curtis Yarvin that Andreessen considers among the “Patron Saints” of Techno-Optimism. People like Thiel, Andreessen, and Musk are serious. They want to implement the Dark Enlightenment and are hell-bent on establishing gov-corp Technates. Their oligarch network is indistinguishable from the Trump administration. Currently, the most powerful nation on earth is in their hands. In true technopopulist fashion, it is perhaps Andreessen’s identification of gov-corp enemies that is most revealing: Our enemies are not bad people – but rather bad ideas. Our present society has been subjected to a mass demoralization campaign for six decades – against technology and against life – under varying names like “existential risk”, “sustainability”, “ESG”, “Sustainable Development Goals”, “social responsibility”, “stakeholder capitalism”, “Precautionary Principle”, “trust and safety”, “tech ethics”, “risk management”, “de-growth”, “the limits of growth”.This demoralization campaign is based on bad ideas of the past – zombie ideas, many derived from Communism, disastrous then and now. The eradication of these “enemies” reads like an American voters’ wish-list. Ridding themselves of the globalist’s overreach exercised through institutions like the WHO, the WEF, the UN and even NATO, is what they seemingly voted for. Andreessen attempt to associate ideas like “sustainability,” “stakeholder capitalism” and even “social responsibility” with communism is, at best, wrong, but appears to be disingenuous and mere pandering. This is the Dark Enlightenment’s technopopulist sales pitch. Escaping the grasp of the oligarchs was obviously a vote winner. But the American public has not escaped, on the contrary it has fallen into the clutches of the most authoritarian oligarchs imaginable. Oligarchs who, perhaps for the first time in history, not only have the political authority but the technology to make their gov-corp Technates a reality. This is a clear and present danger to all of us. Not just Americans. The same commitment to accelerationism and creative destruction is evident everywhere. In essence, gov-corp is the ultimate public-private partnership — a kind of inverted fascism where the private stakeholders use the claimed authority and violence of the state to achieve their goals. The construction of Technates is not limited to the US. Arguably China, for example, is already operating a public-private Technocracy. What is happening under our noses is no libertarian dream realized. It is the construction of an all-cognizant, all-controlling, all-consuming global network of gov-corp Technates overseen by a bureaucracy of multiple poles. On the surface, the new brand of technopopulist politics we’ve been examining seems to be anti-Establishment. At least, that’s how it’s being presented. It will use high-tech solutions and AI analysis to, for instance, deliver “lower taxes, much cheaper energy (green and fossil), faster growth and a productivity revolution.” Lest we forget, it will “make America great again” (MAGA). The trouble with this pipe dream, though, is that the ostensible “technopopulists” and avowed neoreactionaries behind it are actually installing Big “T” Technocracy and gov-corp as their solution. Not MAGA, but “Dark MAGA.” In 2020 Pronomos Capital, a venture capital firm backed by Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen , and Coinbase established the low tax, low regulation nascent city state called Próspera on the island of Roatán in Honduras. The promotional blurb for Próspera read: Próspera is a startup city with a regulatory system designed for entrepreneurs to build better, cheaper, and faster than anywhere else in the world. The current Honduras government considers Próspera’s claim to enjoy special economic and regulatory status illegal. The previous Honduras administration under Juan Orlando Hernández (JOH) — who was later convicted of drug smuggling in the US — initially created three so-called Zones for Employment and Economic Development (ZEDEs) of which Próspera is one. The initiative was fiercely opposed by the people of Honduras. The ZEDEs create a “special regime” where investors — Pronomos Capital (Thiel, Andreessen, etc.) — have absolute control of “fiscal, security and conflict resolution policy.” For all intents and purposes, the ZEDEs are startup gov-corps. In 2022, the incoming administration of Xiomara Castro Sarmiento started the process of repealing the ZEDE legislation. This is proving difficult because the Próspera ZEDE framework has a fifty year “built to last” clause in it guaranteeing the project for that period. Gov-corp investors instigated an $11 billion law suit to stop the Honduras government’s attempts to stymie their ambitions. The technocrat oligarchs deployed the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) mechanism against the elected government of Honduras. It is not unreasonable to describe their action as a direct threat to bankrupt the entire nation. As we’ll discuss, these oligarchs are not “nice” people. Whether they call themselves Christian or not. Many of the Próspera trademarks are held by NeWay Capital LLC, founded by Erick Brimen and Trey Goff. NeWay Capital formed the Freedom Cities Coalition (FCC) which is similarly backed by Pronomos Capital — Thiel, Andreessen, Coinbase et al. In 2023, Trump proposed establishing ten so called “Freedom Cities” in the US. The mainstream media focused on his comments about “flying cars,” but he was really talking about embryonic gov-corp Technates. Reportedly, the FCC is now supposedly “in discussion” with the Trump administration to create gov-corp Technates across the US. Trey Goff said “the energy in DC is absolutely electric” and the ambition was to create “not just ten, but as many as the market can handle.” If approved by Congress, these “startup nations” — neoreactionary realms — will be city states like Próspera. The FCC calls these “special districts” Prosperity Zones. The technopopulist offer is to unleash innovation, onshore employment opportunities and revitalise the American economy. The FCC objective is to “accelerate the development of new urban centers.” Freedom Cities will operate in de facto US ZEDEs. The objective is to remove all regulation and allow tech-oligarchs the freedom to do whatever they like. These will be cities without limits, say the FCC and will be “zones of regulatory clarity and economic dynamism, [. . .] allowing entrepreneurs and builders to move at the speed of human ingenuity.” The accelerationist neoreactionaries and the technocrats are racing ahead. As evidenced by Andreessen’s Techno-Optimist Manifesto, there is no doubt what they have in mind. In 2022, Balaji Srinivasan — former Andreessen Horowitz general partner and former chief technology officer for Coinbase — published his book The Network State: How to Start a New Country. In it, he outlined the neoreactionary strategy to “escape politics in all its forms” and enable tech-billionaire oligarchs to form their own sovereign states—sov-corps. There is nothing pro-American about the NRx’s collective vision. Srinivasan wants the proposed “startup nations” to secede from the US and considers the US outdated and obsolescent. Shortly we’ll discuss Trump’s peculiar and seemingly unilateral declaration that his administration is intent upon grabbing Greenland — and Gaza apparently. We are supposed to believe that it is Trump who wants Greenland (and perhaps Gaza); that Trump is the great strategist playing some sort of 5D geopolitical chess game. But it is Peter Thiel and his oligarch network that wants to build a gov-corp Technate called Praxis on Greenland. The people of Greenland should be wary. There is no legal limit to the “built to last” territorial expansion of Próspera and the TechnoKing oligarchs have the backing of the World Bank to make sure their project does last. Following Trump’s inauguration, The New York Times published an adversarial interview with aforementioned political theorist of the neoreactionary movement (NRx) Curtis Yarvin. Outlining Yarvin’s contention that the US should be run as a corporate monarchy (gov-corp) under the leadership of an all-powerful CEO (Trump), Times‘ writer and interviewer David Marchese formulated his arguments on the suspected racist aspects of Yarvin’s ideology. The pair debated nothing of notable interest. The piece allowed Yarvin to forward some of his ideas to a wider public — but without disclosing any of their appalling implications. Meanwhile, the Times‘ Marchese posited a practically irrelevant counterargument. The legacy media is not going to point out those appalling implications. But this is what Yarvin, the leader of the NRx admired by Peter Thiel and other neoreactionary oligarchs, had proposed in 2008 under his pen name, Mencius Moldburg: Our goal, in short, is a humane alternative to genocide. That is: the ideal solution achieves the same result as mass murder (the removal of undesirable elements from society), but without any of the moral stigma. The best humane alternative to genocide I can think of is not to liquidate the wards [people]—either metaphorically or literally—but to virtualize them. A virtualized human is in permanent solitary confinement, waxed like a bee larva into a cell which is sealed except for emergencies. This would drive him insane, except that the cell contains an immersive virtual-reality interface which allows him to experience a rich, fulfilling life in a completely imaginary world. The suspected racist streak in Yarvin does matter when we consider the implications of his gov-corp philosophy. But to imagine that identity politics provides any kind of intellectual basis to tackle the NRx dooms all such opposition to failure. If the objective is to resist accelerationist neoreaction, then harping on about the divisions between the progressive left and the right-wing — or “alt-right” — serves no useful purpose. Such arguments don’t even come close to comprehending what the Dark Enlightenment is. They only deflect the public from paying vital attention to real threats. The Dark Enlightenment is not racist. It is anti-human race. Its advocates do not care what colour gov-corp’s customers are. They seek, rather, to transform all of humanity, to bring an end to what it is to be a sovereign human being. Musk has already stated his desire to transform his X platform into a payment service provider and finance portal that, he hopes, could become “half of the world’s financial system.” Thanks in part to the headway made by Facebook’s Libra (Diem) project — more in this shortly — in 2023, Musk was able to start applying for the necessary regulatory approval for his financial domination project. Via its “Digital State” — again, we’ll cover this in a moment — Ukrainians are the Digital State’s “customers.” Musk wants to X to form the basis of a worldwide Digital State in which all users will be customers. Citizens as customers of government services is a key component of the gov-corp structure that neoreactionaries like Thiel and Andreessen desire. Just as we see the rise of the accompanying “accelerators” everywhere, so to the description of us as “customers” is seeping into the lexicon of governments the world over. In 2019, the US multinational corporation IBM, whose operations make it the largest industrial research organization in the world and whose chequered history includes assisting the Nazis to perpetrate a holocaust, explained why we all need to consider ourselves the customers of our governments: Today’s society is changing at a record pace as companies worldwide develop innovative solutions designed to make the world a more efficient and sustainable place. [. . .] Apps provide us with personalized information based on geolocation; we can shop online from the comfort of our couch, and organize our finances on our smartphones.[. . .] [I]t’s time to rethink and reinvent public sector services, [. . .] a digital reinvention helps build trust in the public sector as a brand: the government has your back. [. . .] At IBM, we’re there to guide you through the current age of digital reinvention. IBM, alongside CIA-linked Oracle, is a partner of the UK government’s Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and is assisting it to “accelerate transformation” to a new digital DWP service. For its part, as it proceeds to make a £6 billion cut, the UK DWP has stopped winter fuel payments to pensioners and has committed to freezing and restricting access to disability payments to the disabled. It is effectively lowering unemployment benefits for the sick and disabled and tightening the eligibility criteria for nearly all state benefits. At the same time, the UK government is pushing through the Terminally-ill Adults (End of Life) Bill — commonly referred to as the Assisted Dying Bill — to make it easier for the state to kill people who just can’t take it any more. All of this, according to the DWP, is part of its drive to provide a better “customer experience.” In 2021, The Biden administration issued Executive Order 14058 to improve the US federal government’s customer’s experience. Consequently, according to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS): [. . .] every person who pays taxes or uses Medicare is a customer of the federal government. Every veteran who uses a VA facility is a customer, every government employee that fills out their timesheet is a customer. The “customer experience” is how people experience and perceive our government services. It is what happens at the touchpoints when someone interacts with a government service. The customer experience can be a single touchpoint or several over a longer relationship between the “customer” and government. Each touchpoint is an opportunity for a positive interaction that adds up to a positive customer experience. The mainstream media is avidly pushing the idea that politicians like Trump are in charge. But, not only does EO 14058 illustrate the clear shift towards NRx gov-corp aligned thinking, it also shows that the transformation is not dependent on whatever administration happens to be in office at the time. Gov-corp represents the underlying philosophy driving this governance reinvention. Technocracy is the operating system for the impending Technates, regardless of who you vote for. The shift to digital money and “digital states” is key to the reimagining of society. Rather like the WeChat “everything app” in China, which operates as a public-private partnership between the government and Tencent — enabling the technocratic state to directly influence an estimated 1.3 billion Chinese customers –– the size of the X user-base gives Musk’s network an opportunity to construct his version of an everything app digital state. With an estimated 600 million users, Musk’s team is ready to launch his platform’s X-money payment system. It seems Musk doesn’t anticipate any regulatory problems, as another building block of the X-digital state is dropped into place. As X moves toward becoming a “comprehensive financial services hub,” working in partnership with Visa, the plan is to reportedly integrate digital currencies into the X-money system by the end of the year. The new interoperable global monetary system that is emerging has been designed to perpetuate the same old monetary game with the added benefit of AI surveillance and behavioural control. Investors can speculate — engaging in creative destruction — while protecting their digital finance empires by storing value in new digital reserve assets, almost certainly bitcoin. A so-called Synthetic Hegemonic Currency can and is being created, primarily using USD-denominated stablecoins underwritten by US debt. In contrast to the investor experience, it is unlikely to benefit many of its customers. Contemplating new methods of genocide to rid yourself of whomever you find “undesirable” is something we associate with tyrannical megalomaniacs not egalitarian democratic “leaders.” Unfortunately, certainly in the US, it seems the maniac tyrants have the upper hand. As many Unlimited Hangout readers already know, Thiel received investment funds from the CIA’s In-Q-Tel to accelerate Palantir. Part of that arrangement was for Palantir to establish a public-private partnership that would rescue a US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project called Total Information Awareness (renamed the Terrorism-IA program in 2003). The purpose of the TIA was to create an all-pervasive US surveillance and population control system, with a heavy focus on pre-crime and other “predictive” interventions that would allow the state to justify any policy it chooses. The TIA project faltered when the US public learned of its intentions. State funding was officially withdrawn — which simply meant that the “less controversial” aspects continued under the guise of combating terrorism while the controversial projects went darker still. Ever since 9/11, “terrorism” has been the convenient PR buzz word for covering up a multitude of illegalities. The TIA program continued, unabated, to spy on the entire US population as a public-private partnership. Shortly after incorporating Palantir in 2003, Thiel and Palantir co-founder and CEO Alex Karp reportedly met with the TIA’s chief architect, John Poindexter. The pair apparently impressed upon Poindexter that they shared his vision of a US domestic digital gulag. Yet, unlike TIA, which had been housed at the Pentagon’s DARPA, they would develop the TIA system as a private entity. According to New York magazine, Thiel and Karp convinced Poindexter that Palantir would “pull together data collected by a wide range of spy agencies — everything from human intelligence and cell-phone calls to travel records and financial transactions.” Evidently, In-Q-Tel’s seed funding followed soon thereafter. The CIA remained Palantir’s sole client until 2008. That is to say, Palantir enjoyed a monopoly due to its partnership with the state. Although Thiel’s cadre at PayPal — often called the PayPal Mafia — is supposedly responsible for ousting Musk from the company’s CEO spot, the rift between the two men seems somewhat overstated. Just as it is clear Musk hankers to install Technocracy, Thiel’s passion for the Dark Enlightenment is equally unambiguous. Both ideologies are mutually reinforcing. While there are some apparent tensions between Musk and Thiel, they are on the same path. Yarvin, for one, certainly values Musk’s contribution. Thiel and Musk are already megarich magnates on the order of the robber barons of old. As such, their respective Dark Enlightenment and Technocracy dreams, when realized, are intended to make them “sovereigns” of what Yarvin calls a “patchwork of realms.” The shared view of technocrats and neoreactionaries that society would be better if it were ruled by the likes of Musk and Thiel is an absurd and dangerous folly. We shouldn’t labour under any illusions that they’re nice. Anduril Industries CEO Palmer Lucky is another Thiel protégé who, having sold his Oculus VR headset business to Mark Zuckerberg, moved into the war business with the help of Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund. Through Anduril, Thiel is investing in a defence technology that maximises AI’s ability to kill. Peter Thiel and Elon Musk have both been instrumental in the development of AI. They combined forces in 2015 to accelerate Thiel protégé Sam Altman’s OpenAI as a “non-profit” research company. Today, propelled by the success of its ChatGPT generative AI chatbot, OpenAI is valued at around $160 billion. Consequently, its “for profit” subsidiary, OpenAI Global LLC, is poised to make fantastic profits. OpenAI was pitched as a tool for developing AI to “benefit humanity as a whole.” Presumably, OpenAI’s defence contracts and its participation in the Silicon Valley consortium bid to dominate the US military-industrial complex reflect this principled commitment. Or perhaps the ethical stance of the team behind OpenAI is about as plausible as their “non-profit” pretensions. There is every reason not to trust hypocrites like Thiel and Musk. One of those reasons is Palantir’s encroachment into national health-data systems, which is creating a virtual healthcare data monopoly in some countries — including the UK. This is extremely concerning, because it is obvious that patient care — or even basic human compassion — is not a priority for Thiel’s Palantir. There is nothing “Christian” about Thiel’s conduct. On the contrary, Palantir has actively participated in Israel’s Palestinian genocide and in the almost-complete destruction of the Palestinians’ healthcare system. In January 2024, Thiel and Palantir CEO Alex Karp agreed to a strategic partnership with the Israeli Ministry of Defense and signed a deal with the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) to “harness Palantir’s advanced technology in support of war-related missions.” Of this deal the British Medical Journal observed: IOF operations have been described as a “war on hospitals” because of the systematic destruction of Gaza’s entire health system and 943 IOF attacks on healthcare. Hundreds of health workers have been detained, tortured, and killed. In addition to directly attacking healthcare, ongoing bombardment, forced displacement of Palestinians, and near complete siege of Gaza, the IOF has created a severe health and humanitarian crisis with high rates of malnutrition, infectious disease, famine, and dehydration. Several Thiel-backed companies — Palantir (seed-funded by In-Q-Tel),Anduril and digital surveillance company Clearview AI — have all evidently used the Ukraine-Russia conflict as a test bed for their technology. As noted by Stavroula Pabst in her Unlimited Hangout article, “How Peter Thiel-Linked Tech is Fueling the Ukraine War,” these companies are “taking advantage of the conflict to develop controversial AI-driven weapons systems and facial recognition technologies, perhaps transforming both warfare and AI forever.” Despite Thiel’s self-described libertarian and Christian beliefs, Pabst noted that the net impact of his venture capitalism couldn’t be more inhuman: [T]hese Thiel-backed groups’ involvement in war serves to develop not only problematic and unpredictable weapons technologies and systems, but also apparently to advance and further interconnect a larger surveillance apparatus formed by Thiel and his elite allies’ collective efforts across the public and private sectors, which arguably amount to the entrenchment of a growing technocratic panopticon aimed at capturing public and private life. Within the context of Thiel’s growing domination over large swaths of the tech industry, apparent efforts to influence, bypass or otherwise undermine modern policymaking processes, and anti-democratic sentiments, Thiel-linked organizations’ activities in Ukraine can only signal a willingness to shape the course of current events and the affairs of sovereign nations alike. Though Pabst’s piece was written in October 2023, her prescient observations have certainly been playing out. As we embark on 2025, it is clear that Thiel and Musk are among a troop of tech titans who have ingratiated themselves with the Trump administration. While the war in Ukraine has evidently been used by the “TechnoKings” behind Trump to develop AI weapon systems, the Trump administration has hypocritically positioned itself as peace broker. On their own, the ideologies of communitarianism, stakeholder capitalism, Technocracy, the Dark Enlightenment, and any other political ideology amount to little more than academic musings. Once implemented through the power and authority illegitimately claimed by the state, however, they couldn’t be more significant. Thiel has heavily backed current Vice President JD Vance and other Republican political candidates, such as Blake Masters, who co-authored Zero to One: Notes on Startups, Or How to Build the Future with Thiel in 2014. There is a nexus of Thiel protégés surrounding the new Trump administration. It is hard to see how Vance could rise to what some call the second-most-powerful position in the US were it not for the career-long support he has received from Thiel. As Thiel’s man, Vance’s admiration for the Dark Enlightenment is transparent. Adopting Yarvin’s “Retire All Government Employee” (RAGE) motto, which now seems to be embodied by the DOGE, Vance suggested that a future Trump administrator should “fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, [and] replace them with our people.” In 2017, Buzzfeed published extracts from the dump of an email exchange between Curtis Yarvin and Milo Yiannopoulis. In one email, Yarvin revealed that he had watched the 2016 US election results with Thiel and said that Thiel was “fully enlightened, just plays it very carefully.” In his 2021 book, The Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley’s Pursuit of Power, Bloomberg Technology writer Max Chafkin describes Yarvin as the “house political philosopher” of the “Thielverse,” according to a July 2024 article by Gil Duran in The New Republic. Of course, Thiel does not want it widely known that he supports the Dark Enlightenment of the NRx. With its aim to destroy the political realm and replace it with a corporate monarchy, the Dark Enlightenment, if fully understood by the public, would outrage them and would be, for Thiel, a PR disaster. Despite the potential for that to happen, Yarvin’s ideas continue to influence him. One such crazy notion was revealed by Yarvin in his talk at the March 2012 BIL Conference (an alternative to TED). Speaking as Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin advocated for gov-corp: There is no difference between a CEO and a dictator. If Americans want to change their government, they’re going to have to get over their dictator phobia. Just a few weeks later, Thiel gave a lecture at Stanford, where he said: A startup is basically structured as a monarchy. We don’t call it that, of course. That would seem weirdly outdated, and anything that’s not democracy makes people uncomfortable. We are biased toward the democratic-republican side of the spectrum. That’s what we’re used to from civics classes. But the truth is that startups and founders lean toward the dictatorial side because that structure works better for startups. Ten days prior to Trump’s inauguration, Thiel used the Financial Times as an outlet to pontificate about the second-term President’s second-time promises to disclose details of the Kennedy assassination plot and to protect free speech, etc. Time will tell if these promises are kept. In the same article, Thiel laid bare the lineage of his own philosophy: Darker questions still emerge in these dusky final weeks of our interregnum. [. . .] The future demands fresh and strange ideas. New ideas might have saved the old regime, which barely acknowledged, let alone answered, our deepest questions — the causes of the 50-year slowdown in scientific and technological progress. Certainly from 2009 onward, Thiel has viewed politics as a vehicle to promote his accelerationist NRx-aligned objectives. Not because he particularly shares the values of any political party, either Democrat or Republican — or, for that matter, Libertarian — but because he recognises that people are programmed to feel comfortable as long as they believe whatever they support has something to do with “democracy.” Remember, Thiel calls us the “unthinking demos.” In 2014, reporting the evidence of some of the other links between Yarvin and Thiel, Corey Pein, writing for The Baffler, accurately lumped Thiel in with the NRx and called them collectively a bunch of “mouthbreathing Machiavellis.” Responding to Pein’s piece, Thiel said, according to an article published shortly thereafter in The New York Times: Actually, I found that vaguely flattering. [. . .] It was the full-on conspiracy theory. In truth, there’s nobody sitting around plotting the future, though sometimes I think it would be better if people were. This was blatant baloney. Thiel well knows there are people “sitting around plotting the future.” He himself maintains a web of connections with the plotters of which he speaks — and is obviously one of them. Thiel, as President of Thiel Capital, sits on the Bilderberg Steering Committee. The steering committee sets the agenda for the secretive Bilderberg Meetings where around 130 selected globalist delegates debate policy initiatives behind closed doors. Palantir CEO, Thiel’s associate Alex Karp, is also on the steering committee, as is former chair and CEO of Google Eric Schmidt and the President of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Børge Brende. Consequently, it isn’t surprising that the main topic for debate at the last 2024 Bilderberg meeting was Artificial Intelligence (AI). Former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has been selected as the chair for the next Bilderberg Meeting and will also serve as chair of the next Munich Security Conference (MSC). The UK Guardian reports that his appointment marks a moment where the “influential” Bilderberg group is contributing toward the “concentration of control at the top of the Atlantic alliance.” Noting that Bilderberg brings together “prime ministers, EU commissioners, bank bosses, corporate CEOs and intelligence chiefs,” it was ridiculous for Thiel — a senior Bilderberger — to feign ignorance of those who evidently are “plotting the future.” Yarvin, in the earlier-referenced interview with David Marchese in The New York Times, was asked what he meant when he said Thiel was “fully enlightened”: Fully enlightened for me means fully disenchanted. [. . .] It’s a disenchantment from believing in these old systems. And the thing that should replace that disenchantment is not, Oh, we need to do things Curtis’s [or Peter’s] way. It’s basically just a greater openness of mind. Sure, the Dark Enlightenment rejects the “old systems” — i.e., representative democracy — but Yarvin’s diplomatic response cannot hide the fact that Thiel and other members of the NRx evidently know what they want to replace it with: gov-corp overseeing a network of sovcorp-managed functional sequences in a Technate instead of within existing nation-states. While the war in Ukraine has evidently been used by the “TechnoKings” behind Trump to develop AI weapon systems, the Trump administration has hypocritically positioned itself as peace broker. Obviously, any sane person would welcome the end of hostilities, but there is a clear subtext to the US policy shift. The Trump administration has emphasised the US potential deal with Ukraine to access Ukraine’s possible rare earth metal deposits as a “win” for US voters. He told the US public that there were “$500B worth of rare earth” in Ukraine. This is highly speculative. While Ukraine certainly has a lot of coal, oil, gas and uranium, much if that is in territory currently occupied by the Russian Federation. The estimates of rare earth metal deposits in extant Ukrainian territory were made around half a century ago and some, such as independent energy and mining consultant Tony Mariano, have significant doubts about the commercial viability or even the presence of the alleged deposits: As far as I know, there are no economically viable rare earth deposits in Ukraine. I have evaluated clay deposits that I thought had potential, but I found that they are not viable. This does not mean that there are none, but that more exploration and evaluation is needed. With regard to the minerals deposits that are known to exist in Russia’s “new territories,” including any possible if unlikely rare-earth deposits, Russian president Vladimir Putin has indicated his willingness to collaborate with the US again. In the spirit of public-private partnership (stakeholder capitalism), Putin told journalist Pavel Zarubin that Russia was ready “to offer [cooperation] to our American partners – when I say partners, I mean not only administrative and government structures, but also companies.” While Russians and Ukrainians continued to die, Kirill Dmitriev, former Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and WEF investment guru, and the current CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund — appointed in 2023 by Putin as special representative of the Russian president for investment — said that US energy corporations would welcome “access to Russian natural resources.” In 2014, the US enabled and supported Ukrainian Nazis (the Right Sector and others) to orchestrate the violent Euromaidan Coup that overthrew the elected president Victor Yanukovich. Ukrainian Nazi atrocities in Odessa and Mariupol immediately followed and marked the start of an eight-year-long war that Russian forces officially entered in 2022. From the moment Russia began its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine, the US response was focused on seizing economic, financial and resource control of Ukraine in exchange for bolstering its military. It is not unreasonable to observe that Russian intervention enabled the US public-private partnership to capture Ukraine. With the Russian government now looking forward to working with its US partners, and given that the US state was instrumental in instigating the current conflict, one has to wonder what this war has really been about. Large US corporations, such as Microsoft and Amazon, began the process of digitising the Ukrainian government on February 24th 2022, the day Russia is said to have “invaded” Ukraine. This process has since seen Ukraine become a world leader in “digital democracy.” Ukrainian citizens are being coerced towards accepting digital ID, digital payments and into total reliance on digital infrastructure for many of their everyday needs. This has been met with great enthusiasm from globalist think tanks, such as The Centre for International Governance Innovation. As Ukrainian energy and technological infrastructure became more reliant on US corporations, global investors — through the asset management giant BlackRock — agreed to deals with the Ukrainian government to “structure the nation’s reconstruction funds.” In November 2022 BlackRock announced: BlackRock FMA [Financial Markets Advisory] will advise the MoE [Ukraine Ministry of Economy] on establishing a roadmap for the investment framework’s implementation, including identifying design choices for the envisioned setup, structure, mandate and governance. The MoU [Memorandum of Understanding] formalizes the discussions the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, held in September on the possibilities of driving public and private investments into Ukraine. The WEF arranged further meetings between Zelensky’s administration and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon alongside a consortium of investors represented by executives from BlackRock, Bridgewater Associates, Carlyle Group, Blackstone, Dell, ArcelorMittal, and others. With the financial architecture in place, and US and other multinational corporations set to capitalise, the emphasis shifted in early 2024 towards reducing the investment risk. War is the preferred business model for private military contractors (PMCs – mercenaries), or International Defense Companies (IDCs) as they are called in Ukraine. With Ukrainian government legislation in the pipeline to legalise IDCs operating in post-war Ukraine — coinciding with the Pentagon’s decision to ease restrictions supposedly placed on US PMCs (IDCs) working in Ukraine — US PMCs are just one corner of the US military industrial complex set to exploit the thirty-five-fold increase in the Ukrainian defence market created by Russia’s “invasion.” This is yet another tantalising Ukraine war opportunity for multinational financiers, such as BlackRock’s investors for example. Obviously, a “post-war” Ukraine is needed to turn these investment opportunities into solid ventures. With the US public-private stakeholder invasion of Ukraine complete, and the Russian public-private stakeholders ready to do business, Ukraine finds itself in a precarious position. It is almost completely in the hands of US corporations. For example, Ukraine is now heavily reliant on Musk’s Starlink for its internet connectivity and other communication systems. Indeed Ukraine’s “digital democracy” is now largely controlled by oligarchs like Musk. The Ukrainian Diia app is the product of a joint project between the CIA front organisation USAID and the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation which named Diia the literal Digital State. Diia is an “everything app.” It ties Ukrainian citizens to a centralised digital control system (Diia) through which they access government services. Their digital IDs and digital passports, driving licenses, fine levies and payments, their tax returns, tax accounts, their mRNA vaccine certificates and more can all be overseen by the Digital State. Of course, the overwhelming priority is to end the war. From a humanitarian perspective, at this point, nothing could be more important. Trump will almost certainly be credited if his apparent diplomacy succeeds and this will surely be perceived as more evidence of his great leadership by his supporters. We are supposed to believe that the Ukraine government’s stalling over Trump’s deal for US corporations’ access to Ukrainian rare earth deposits is the reason why the US has reportedly threatened to cut off Ukraine’s Starlink connectivity. The privatisation of a state like Ukraine couldn’t be more dangerous for its people. Musk was quick to point out that he could personally end Ukraine’s war effort, claiming the Ukrainian military’s “entire front line would collapse if I turned it off.” He later added this is something he would not do. Though obviously, given the Dogecoin debacle, Musk’s team fully comprehend the impact his comments have. In truth, there is a vast network of international investors looking at a post-war Ukraine with avarice. The rare earth deal is a sideshow to keep the public bemused. The whole nation state of Ukraine is ripe for the picking and the transition to a US satellite gov-corp Technate is already well underway. As previously noted, one of Peter Thiel’s long-term ambitions has been to create “a new world currency.” Fortuitously, one of Trump’s first executive orders was aimed at strengthening US leadership in digital financial technology. In it, he promised his voter base that he would prohibit “the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC [Central Bank Digital Currency] within the jurisdiction of the United States.” But there is a caveat: The order “shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.” As we know, legislative “laws” are subject to change at any time. Trump included in this EO a US government commitment to promote and protect “the sovereignty of the United States dollar, including through actions to promote the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide.” [Emphasis added.] As extensively reported in the four-part investigative series on the cryptocurrency industry published last November by Unlimited Hangout writers Whitney Webb and Mark Goodwin, rather than averting the societal risks associated with CBDC, Trump’s January 23rd executive order arguably portends something far worse. As Webb and Goodwin pointed out: [T]he policy of the Federal Reserve since last year has made it clear that they favor “private stablecoin issuance rather than official CBDC issuance.” With stablecoins being just as programmable and surveillable as CBDCs, and some stablecoin issuers like Tether already allied with U.S. intelligence and security agencies, the current stablecoin bill is poised to pave the way for the U.S.’ de facto CBDC and to ensure that Wall Street and well-established titans of digital finance like PayPal have the advantage. In particular, Thiel, PayPal, Facebook (now Meta), and US financial regulators have, for some time, been preparing for “a new world currency.” In order to understand the process they have been setting up, we first need to consider how this public-private partnership has apparently shaped the financial regulatory framework in the US. Thiel emphasised the “new world currency” idea in his aforementioned 2009 article, “The Education of a Libertarian” (the piece, you may remember, that influenced Nick Land’s conceptualisation of the Dark Enlightenment). In that piece, he wrote: [T]he founding vision of PayPal centered on the creation of a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution — the end of monetary sovereignty, as it were. In the 2000s, companies like Facebook create the space for new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states. By starting a new Internet business, an entrepreneur may create a new world. The hope of the Internet is that these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order. Peter Thiel sat on the Meta (Facebook) board of directors until 2022, when he left to reportedly “focus on political endeavours.” Upon his departure, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered his personal gratitude to Thiel for “teaching me so many lessons about business, economics, and the world.” In 2019, under Thiel’s evident influence, Facebook announced its intention to launch a stablecoin payment system called Libra, which it soon renamed Diem. The project was co-headed by David A. Marcus, who moved to Facebook from PayPal in 2014, and by Morgan Beller, who migrated from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Libra appears to have failed. But, as Whitney Webb and Mark Goodwin explain, that interpretation depends upon what one views the purpose of Libra (Diem) to have actually been. With an estimated two billion-plus Facebook users worldwide, if Libra had succeeded, it would have represented the potential “end of monetary sovereignty” as far as central banks were concerned. Apparently, the mere announcement of Libra’s proposition sent financial regulators into an tailspin. The unregulated issuance of “money” couldn’t be allowed to happen! Hence, Zuckerberg had to be seen being quizzed by pretty much the entire global financial and political “elite.” In May 2019, Thiel protégé Sam Altman wrote a blog post in which he said: Although I don’t think the US government can stop cryptocurrency, I do think it could create the winner — let’s call it “USDC” for US Digital Currency — and fix some challenges that governments currently face with cryptocurrency. I think the first superpower government to do something like this will have an enviable position in the future of the world, and some power over a worldwide currency. In August 2019, at the G7 central bankers symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the main topic of discussion was what the Bank of England’s then-Governor Mark Carney called a growing “destabilising asymmetry at the heart of the IMFS” [International Monetary and Financial System]. Carney told the gathered bankers and financiers that the “world economy was being reordered.” He said that the US dollar remained “important” in the short term but that “the game” must change to suit a “multipolar world.” Therefore, “the global reserve currency”—the US dollar (USD) — needed to transform into some sort of “Synthetic Hegemonic Currency” (SHC). Carney added: While the likelihood of a multipolar IMFS might seem distant at present, technological developments provide the potential for such a world to emerge. Such a platform would be based on the virtual rather than the physical. [. . .] Technology has the potential to disrupt the network externalities that prevent the incumbent global reserve currency [the USD] from being displaced. [. . .] The most high-profile of these has been Libra—a new payments infrastructure based on an international stablecoin fully backed by reserve assets in a basket of currencies including the US dollar, the euro, and sterling. [. . .] The Bank of England and other regulators have been clear [. . .] the terms of engagement for any new systemic private payments system must be in force well in advance of any launch. As a consequence, it is an open question whether such a new Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) would be best provided by the public sector, perhaps through a network of central bank digital currencies. [. . .] Even if the initial variants of the idea prove wanting, the concept is intriguing. It is worth considering how an SHC in the IMFS could support better global outcomes, given the scale of the challenges of the current IMFS and the risks in transition to a new hegemonic reserve currency like the Renminbi. So, here is Carney saying that the Libra stablecoin raised the “intriguing” possibility of creating a new SHC “backed by reserve assets” but that Libra itself was “wanting” due to the lack of clear “terms of engagement.” However, if the requisite regulatory “terms of engagement” were “in force well in advance of any launch,” Carney raised the potential to create an SHC using Libra-like stablecoins. This, he proposed, could stave off challenges from new possible hegemonic reserve currency alternatives, such as China’s Renminbi, and create a USD SHC suitable for a “multipolar IMFS.” A month after Jackson Hole, in September 2019, Zuckerberg met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss “future internet regulation.” He was also invited to the White House for a “surprise” meeting. Then, in October, Zuckerberg testified before the House Financial Services Committee about the aforementioned Libra (Diem) and was invited again to the White House — this time for dinner and this time accompanied by then Facebook board member Peter Thiel. The Trump administration didn’t think it necessary to disclose what was discussed, according to an NBC News report. Immediately thereafter, Zuckerberg’s Libra project began to shift away from a stablecoin based on “a basket of currencies,” and by 2020 it was more closely aligned with the USD. The Financial Times reported in late November 2021 that Libra would initially launch as “a single coin backed one-for-one by the dollar.” Webb and Goodwin speculate, with good reason, that the whole point of Facebook’s purportedly aggressive pursuit of Libra (Diem) was not so much about the stablecoin itself but rather about creating a threat that would appear to warrant regulatory change. It appears the team behind Libra always anticipated the failure of Libra and the resultant formation of a regulatory framework for a potential USD Synthetic Hegemonic Currency. Going back to July 2019, two months before the Jackson Hole symposium, Facebook stated in an SEC filing: Libra has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. [. . .] These laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may delay or impede the launch of the Libra currency. [. . .] As such, there can be no assurance that Libra or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely manner, or at all. The fact that Facebook (now Meta) knew Libra might fail and was counting on new regulations that would open new digital financial markets could cause careful observers to conclude that Zuckerberg’s Libra project was intended to be an embodiment of “creative destruction.” While the Libra (Diem) stablecoin didn’t make it, the stablecoin market as a whole has done quite well, if one measures by market capitalization. The leading stablecoins are Tether’s USDT ($140 billion), Circle’s USDC ($44 billion), and the Ethereum blockchain-based “decentralised” DAI ($3 billion). Then we have FD121 Ltd.’s FDUSD ($1.8 billion) and USDD ($750 million), initially issued on the TRON blockchain. PayPal stablecoin PYUSD, issued by the Paxos Trust Company and currently at $480 million market cap, stands apart because Paxos is a fully regulated US custodian. What’s more, PYUSD is perhaps the most firmly 1:1 USD-pegged stablecoin, backed as it is with a mix of USD deposits, short-term US Treasurys, and cash equivalents. When the Nixon administration closed the gold window in 1971, ending the monetary system formulated at Bretton Woods in 1944, the USD became fully disassociated from any real intrinsic value (gold), though fractional reserve banking had already practically relinquished the dollar-and-gold association. The subsequent fiat currency monetary system has led to an enormous expansion of the money supply and ballooning of global debt. Those inevitabilities ultimately caused what Carney described as the “destabilising asymmetry at the heart of the IMFS.” Carney recognised that the world’s leading holders of US debt were Japan and China. Both countries have been accelerating the process of dumping US Treasury securities (government bonds). Their bond market moves further threaten the dominance of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Now Trump has come to the White House with a fiscal policy package promising low domestic taxes and higher international trade tariffs at the very time that his country’s “exorbitant privilege” — the US economic advantage gained by funding its own deficit by issuing the reserve currency every other nation needs to buy — is receding. US public spending is fuelled by borrowing — by issuing government bonds. The traditional monetary view would suggest that the only option available to the US is to massively inflate the money supply — again! But, with its staggering $36 trillion national debt, and with other national governments increasingly unwilling to buy that debt (creating a lower demand), US borrowing costs seem set to rise and exacerbate the mounting debt problem. Bluntly put, the US dollar and the US economy would appear to be screwed. Unless, of course, the US can find some other outlet to absorb its debt. If it can, there’s no reason why the monetary Ponzi scheme can’t carry on. Obviously, it will continue to have a terrible impact on people around the world, especially the poorest — including the poorest Americans. But when have rapacious oligarchs ever cared about social deprivation? The total supply of stablecoins has now eclipsed $200 billion. In the US, Tether is currently the third-largest buyer of US 3-month Treasuries and the 16th-largest purchaser of US government bonds globally. Because they absorb US debt, stablecoins are seen as the key to stabilising US interest rates. The proposed Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act has led some to suggest that it might become a regulatory requirement for USD-denominated digital tokens (stablecoins) to back their coins with nothing but US Treasury bills. If so, under Paxos’ custody, PYUSD is already well-placed to take advantage. The bitcoin (BTC) hard cap, embedded in its code, ensures that no more that 21 million BTC can ever be “mined” (that is, issued). Every four years “halving” occurs, thereby theoretically reducing bitcoin issuance. This is the polar opposite of the fiat monetary system, in which the money supply can, realistically, only expand. The resulting inflation persistently devalues fiat currency. Bitcoin, however, is inherently deflationary. It is a tempting store of value for oligarchs who have treated the fiat currency system as if it were their own fiefdom to control and have run it into the ground. Currently the top 21 holders of bitcoin collectively possess 2.3 million BTC, representing around 11% of the total bitcoin supply. At today’s prices, that is the equivalent of $236 billion in BTC holdings. The presumably pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, author (or authors) of the original bitcoin white paper and possessor of perhaps as much as 1.1 million BTC, is officially the 19th wealthiest individual on the planet, worth around $91 billion. He may not be an individual but a collection of bitcoin founders. Some believe the name was made up by intelligence officials who could be behind the creation of bitcoin. MicroStrategy, which provides business intelligence and mobile software services and whose leading shareholders are Capital Group, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, and BlackRock, is the second-largest holder of bitcoin after Nakamoto. The third largest are the combined governments of the US and the UK, which reportedly hold $19 billion and $6 billion of bitcoin, respectively. Block.one — backed by Thiel — is the fourth largest, with more than $15 billion. The fifth-largest holder is Tether, owner of the USDT stablecoin, which has $8 billion and is the world’s largest trader of cryptocurrency. Tether has committed to investing 15% of its annual profits in bitcoin. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, grilled last March by Yahoo Finance, called BTC “the most valuable asset in the world” and “the endgame for anybody that wants to own the greatest property in the 21st century.” And, according to a blurb last October by Forbes senior contributor Billy Bambrough, who has the magazine’s bitcoin and blockchain beat, “Saylor has revealed [MicroStrategy’s] endgame [. . .] to become a bitcoin investment bank—and to buy up to $150 billion of bitcoin.” MicroStrategy investors are presumably eager to see that bid succeed. They’re aware, as is Saylor, that being bullish on bitcoin further stimulates demand for BTC and brings “the endgame” closer. BlackRock apparently agrees. The multinational investment company has seen its global asset portfolio increase to approximately $11 trillion, thanks in no small measure to its pivot toward digital currencies. Hitherto cool on cryptocurrencies, as other large investment houses have been, BlackRock now considers bitcoin in particular to be a digital asset. “We believe,” said CEO Larry Fink last October, that “bitcoin is [an] asset class in itself, an alternative to other commodities like gold.” Also, BlackRock is now among those advocating digitizing the dollar. Trump’s executive order establishing the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets has tasked that group with developing “a Federal regulatory framework governing digital assets, including stablecoins, and evaluating the creation of a strategic national digital assets stockpile.” Simultaneously, the trajectory toward setting bitcoin as the “new gold alternative” is well underway. Notably, the Swiss government has already started the formal process of amending Article 99 of the Swiss Federal Constitution to allow the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to hold BTC reserves. “On-ramps” are payment services that allow users to exchange fiat currency for digital assets like stablecoins. “Off-ramp” services allow users to convert digital assets back into fiat currencies. Using stablecoins, pegged 1:1 to the USD, greatly simplifies the process if you want dollars. That said, in a “multipolar IMFS,” Chinese and Japanese customers, for example, might not want USDs. Advances in decentralized finance technology (DeFi) are homogenizing global currencies. An effective SHC, with the USD set to dominate, is rapidly approaching. Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) facilitates cross-border payment in USDC. This is fine if you want to off-ramp into fiat USDs, but if you want Euros, you still need to deal with the USD-Euro exchange rate (market price). This additional exchange reduces speed and increases the cost of the transaction (gas fees), thereby limiting scalability to non-USD customers. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as Uniswap, make use of Automated Market Maker (AMM) DeFi. This better enables cross-border transactions between stablecoins backed by different fiat currencies. Cross-chain interoperability protocols facilitate communication and data-sharing between different blockchains. Combined with AMM advances, cross-border stablecoin transactions are consistently becoming faster and cheaper. Circle’s EURC is a Euro-backed stablecoin fully compliant with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). In 2024, researchers from Warwick Business School on-ramped in USD (USDC) and off-ramped in Euros (EURC) using Circle’s AMM. The researchers reported: Given that EURC is pegged to the Euro and USDC to the US dollar, trading in the EURC/USDC market should closely track developments in the traditional EUR/USD market. Indeed, we found that the blockchain market operates efficiently, with EURC/USDC prices staying within 20 basis points — or 0.2 percentage points — of traditional EUR/USD market prices. Furthermore, blockchain prices responded to macroeconomic information, such as interest rate announcements from the US Federal Reserve. The USD-backed stablecoins have primacy, and a USD-denominated SHC seems by far the most likely outcome. That said, some experts, such as former Binance.US CEO and 1Money founder Brian Shroder, predict a multicurrency stablecoin future. In a recent interview with CoinTelegraph, Shroder said, “We envision a global network powered by stablecoins representing all major currencies.” Equally, if interoperability protocols and AMM DeFi development continue to accelerate, such a multicurrency system is still likely to protect the USD. Those pushing USD dominance, such as the Thiel-led consortium behind the Global Dollar Network’s USDG stablecoin, with its proposed cross-chain interoperability, evidently have the edge. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) runs The Taskforce on Cross-border Payments Interoperability and Extension (PIE Taskforce). The committee was formed in response to the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments (established in 2020 with the final stage three report published in 2023 — hereafter referred to as the G20 Roadmap), which, the BIS notes, seeks to enhance “cross-border payments’ speed and transparency, while increasing access to cross-border payment services and reducing their costs.” The G20 — short for Group of 20 — is an international forum comprised of 19 member states (including the US, the UK, Russia, China, and India) plus the European Union (EU) and the African Union (AU). Formed in 1999, it is structured as a multipolar global forum of five internal groups with the aim of coordinating economic policy. The finance ministers and central bank governors of the respective G20 member states and of the EU and AU dominate G20 deliberations. An important contributor to the G20-and-BIS-aligned CPMI-PIE taskforce is Coinbase, which was accelerated into existence by Y-Combinator (see Part 1). Coinbase responded to the recent PIE consultation by making the point that all the G20 Roadmap targets could be met by properly regulated stablecoins. Coinbase observed that “a mixed-payments ecosystem” that supports “traditional bank rails and wholesale payments” can benefit from stablecoin adoption. The global digital ID network is being created from a range of “interoperable” but “vendor-agnostic” digital ID products. There won’t be just one global digital ID card or biometric ID product—such as a single facial recognition system. Instead, all such products and systems will export data using an agreed-upon machine-readable format. In the case of digital ID products and systems, they will comply with ISO/IEC 19794 Series and ISO/IEC 19785 biometric data interchange formats. Thus, it is entirely possible that a single global database, perhaps the World Bank’s ID4D or some similar global solution, could collect data from all the interoperable vendor-agnostic digital ID products and systems worldwide. The ID4D project is supporting the introduction of global interoperability standards that will be “capable of facilitating transactions in the digital age.” The International Organization for Standardization, abbreviated as ISO (not IOS), has an international standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions. This standard, called “ISO 20022,” is explained as: [. . .] a global messaging standard designed to improve communication between financial institutions through structured, machine-readable messages. [. . .] ISO 20022 facilities interoperability and efficiency across payment systems, securities markets, and other financial domains. Its rich data fields and extensibility make it a cornerstone for modernizing global financial infrastructure. It goes without saying that the BIS — specifically its Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) — is eager to embrace the ISO’s “payments data harmonisation,” which it announced last month. As noted by CentralBank.com, “A key factor in achieving more efficient cross-border payments is the use of the same data standards by all countries, and the ISO 20022.” ISO 20022-compliant stablecoins and underlying blockchains are emerging, according to a December 2024 article in CryptoNews.com. This innovation is being propelled by the multipolar G20 Roadmap and raises the potential of establishing a global “unified ledger” — or “shared ledger” — that effectively oversees every digital financial transaction on earth. In 2024, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, recognizable by its acronym, SWIFT, reported: The concept of a new, universal shared ledger for digital payments and assets is gaining interest as a way of transforming how transactions are recorded and settled. [. . .] In its Annual Economic Report 2023, the BIS presented its blueprint for a future monetary system, envisaging a new type of financial market infrastructure—a “unified ledger”—which could “capture the full benefits of tokenisation.” [. . .] [T]he shared ledger model could potentially help to improve the cost, speed, predictability and accessibility of cross-border payments — thereby supporting the G20 roadmap. [. . .] [A]n ISO 20022-based messaging layer will enhance the shared ledger proposition. A Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) is being constructed, but, like its global digital ID counterpart, it is very unlikely to be one stablecoin or one digital asset or token. Rather, as Coinbase developers put it, the SHC will be a “mixed-payments ecosystem.” The SHC is going to be an interoperable network of “vendor-agnostic” digital tokens. Stablecoins are accelerating the SHC’s development. Interoperability, enabled by machine-readable data harmonisation, will revolutionise business-to-business (B2B) transactions. The race is on to seize control of the “new world” of regulated stablecoins. Peter Thiel and his protégés, working in partnership with Musk and others, have established a global network of tech and tech-finance companies that have been key drivers in creating a “new world currency.” That we find ourselves where we are today is no accident. In 2023, Tether’s new CEO, Paolo Ardoino, was under investigation by the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs for potential sanction-busting financial activity. He submitted a letter to the committee in which he reported yet more evidence of the close relationship between leading players in the financial technology (FinTech) development community and the US defence-and-intelligence complex. Ardoino wrote: On December 1, 2023, we launched a wallet-freezing policy designed to significantly enhance the tools available for law enforcement agencies seeking to combat illicit use of stablecoins. [. . .] Tether recently onboarded the United States Secret Service into our platform and is in the process of doing the same with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These strategic relationships reinforce our commitment to supporting law enforcement. [. . .] We have assisted in freezing, as of the date of this letter, approximately 326 wallets totaling approximately USDT 435 Million for the Department of Justice, US Secret Service, and FBI. [. . .] We look forward to maintaining a close working relationship with law enforcement, policymakers, and regulators in shaping a secure, compliant, and resilient future for digital currencies. During the Canadian trucker protests against pandemic mandates in early 2022, commercial banks and payment providers facilitated the Canadian government’s demand to freeze protesters’ financial assets and disable supporters’ ability to donate to fundraising campaigns for the truckers. Similarly, the UK government is currently forming legislation that would allow authorities to access citizens’ bank accounts and seize control of their finances — under the guise of combatting fraud. In both of these examples of the public-private abuse of claimed authority, two mechanisms were and are needed to enforce tyranny: agreement (that is, the banks and payment providers’ willingness to collaborate) and legislation (either existing or new). But in a world of solely digital money, neither policy debates nor the passing of legislation are strictly necessary. Total surveillance of our use of money and the ability to programme our spending is innate to the “new world currency” —USD SHC. From humanity’s perspective, no matter where we reside, the most alarming aspect of digital currencies — stablecoins, retail CBDC, or otherwise — is their surveillance capabilities and, in particular, their programmability feature. Trump’s new executive order on digital finance suggests that instead of elected officials programming our money, this task should be handed over to multistakeholder partnerships. To understand why programmability is a risk to all of us, consider the words of Bo Li, the former Deputy Governor of the Bank of China and the current Deputy Managing Director of the IMF. In October 2022, Bo Li said: CBDC can allow government agencies and private sector players to program — to create smart contracts — to allow targeted policy functions. For example, welfare payments; for example, consumption coupons; for example, food stamps. By programming CBDC, [. . .] money can be precisely targeted [to] what kind of [things] people can own, and [the kinds of ways] this money can be utilised. Digital “money” can be programmed to automatically bar us from donating to the “wrong” cause or from transacting with certain “undesirable”individuals. Every transaction we make and all funds we receive will be recorded on the corresponding “ledger” (likely to be a blockchain) from which our financial activity will be monitored, analysed, and inspected. Such a system obviates the need for legislation to snoop into our bank accounts. China’s digital states — WeChat pay, and the similarly popular Alipay — are fully integrated with China’s e-CNY retail central bank digital currency (r-CBDC). China’s stakeholder capitalist approach to controlling its “customers” payments is not dissimilar to that currently being pursued in Ukraine—using its e-Hyrvnia r-CBDC—and a similar system is proposed by the Russian public-private state. The head of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, Anatoly Aksakov, told the news outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta that the battle against cybercrime and financial fraud meant that the Russian retail CBDC — the digital ruble — would allow accounts to be blocked, depending on “certain rules.” Payment restrictions could be applied, transactions inspected and control measures taken “if necessary,” he said. Also adopting the stakeholder capitalism model, Aksakov said Russia’s “major telecom operators, cybersecurity experts and key IT companies,” alongside the commercial banks, would partner with the Russian government to put together these “new measures.” Looking to the future, he suggested “joint ventures” could include the “American banks,” adding that “Visa or Mastercard” could assist with the rollout of the digital ruble control measures. Like Bo Li, Anatolov also emphasised the social engineering potential of the digital ruble: Payments in the digital ruble can be linked to smart contracts, where the transfer or remuneration to the contractor is regulated by a computer program, not a person. [. . .] We are now focusing on using the digital ruble to control the targeted spending of the [fiscal] budget. [. . .] Should we convert maternity capital or child benefit into the digital ruble and make it so that they cannot be spent on alcohol and cigarettes? In my opinion this is a justified measure and such restrictions are necessary. The US is evidently taking a different path towards its proposed digital state, preferring cryptocurrencies and stablecoins for programmability. But irrespective of whether your government and its partners opt for the retail CBDC or the approved stablecoin route, the outcome is a digital surveillance and control system. Stablecoins are certainly no less programmable than CBDCs. Global outsourcing digital employment agency Rise observed: The programmability of stablecoins through smart contracts opens avenues for innovations such as machine-to-machine payments in IoT applications. [. . .] The future of stablecoin payments is bright, with ongoing innovations and increasing adoption promising to transform how we conduct financial transactions. These technological innovations portend much more than simply transforming “how we conduct financial transactions.” In its totality, interoperable, AI-controlled digital technology threatens to change every aspect of our lives. If it does, we should not lose sight of the fact that AI is programmed by motivated human beings who hold ideological beliefs. The Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Bodies (IoB); advances in machine-to-machine (M2M) payments — with AI algorithms automatically deducting digital money from our digital wallets absent any human interaction –– and an interconnected network of smart homes on smart grids paints a dystopian future few of us wish to contemplate. Unfortunately, the enabling gov-corp Technates are being built. The digital currency powered smart home concept has already arrived. This is achieved by linking IoT powered homes to digital wallets overseen by surveillance of the smart grid to which they are attached. Howard Lutnick’s—Trump’s pick for secretary of commerce — investment in Satellogic, via Endeavour, places him and his partners in prime position to capitalise on what the WEF calls the “trillion dollar opportunity” presented by the Earth Observation industry (EO). Orbiting satellite networks harvest data from digital devices and the subsequent AI analyses of the gathered EO data is set to revolutionise pretty much every industrial sector. Now in office, Lutnick can be confident in his assertion that Satellogic and its investors, including Tether, are “uniquely positioned to dominate the Earth Observation industry.” Just as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins in particular, are providing space for expansion of US debt, so to they are enabling accelerated investment in the development of the emerging “digital states.” Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, such as that being developed by Musk’s Neuralink, is bringing us closer to becoming “technoplastic beings.” It comes as no surprise that Peter Thiel is a Neuralink investor. Thiel also invests in Musk’s BCI competitors — Blackrock Neurotech is one. Again, Tether is also an investment partner of Blackrock Neurotech. There is evidently technological competition. On the one hand we have Musk’s Space X, Neuralink and X-pay, on the other we have Sattelogic, Blackrock Neurotech and Tether. But as we can see from Thiel’s investment strategy, it is the transhumanist and neurowarfare potential of BCI technology that excites technopopulist oligarchs. Competition stimulates development until the winning monopoly establishes itself. The programmable nature of the so-called “digital money,” combined with smart devices on smart grids, enabling precise monitoring of our energy use means that, de facto, “Energy Certificates” are being rolled out. Trump’s digital finance executive order does not nullify the threat posed by CBDCs. It simply diverts public attention away from the immense threat posed by programmable digital currency in general. Programmable, privately issued stablecoins are intended to avert the looming US debt crisis by absorbing US debt in cryptocurrencies. But the evident additional hope is that this tactic will give the US a head start in the race toward Technocracy. When Technocracy was designed in the 1930s, the scale of the surveillance and control system it proposed was soon discarded as unworkable. The idea of creating a bureaucracy capable of monitoring the energy use of every citizen and every business across a continent, using the technology of that day, was a fantastical proposition. Measuring a citizen’s or business’ energy usage via any kind of manageable monetary system, with expenditures controlled by linking the currency to identity, was simply not feasible. But today, not only is Technocracy finally technologically possible, the infrastructure for the rollout of Technocracy is ,as a result, being actively constructed. Technologically, such a dystopia is well within the realm of possibility. Do you imagine that the oligarchs behind the construction of the necessary infrastructure would never implement this digital panopticon? If so, perhaps it is time to ask yourself why they are building it. Is it simply because people like Elon Musk want us to live “lives of abundance”? To be clear: programmable money combined with digital ID is likely to enable oligarchs, via public-private partnership, to oversee “the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism”—that is, Technocracy. It will potentially give them total control of the distribution of “goods and services to the entire population.” In short, technological innovation has made a Technate eminently possible. The newly not-elected prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, is among the few, in the current crop of politicians, who is closely and directly connected to the globalist oligarchy. In a interview with Juno News, given shortly before he became prime minister, Mark Carney argued for the alleged benefits of said global oligarchy: I know how the world works, I know how to get things done, I’m connected. [. . .] People will charge me with being elitist or a globalist, to use that term, which is, well, that’s exactly, it happens to be exactly what we need. Carney’s proposed Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) is intended to position the West in preparation for the emerging multipolar world order. It is obvious, therefore, that multipolarity poses no threat to globalist oligarchs. The so-called “global elite” have always been quite open about their ambitions, but Carney’s words suggest that they feel extra-emboldened at the moment. There is nothing new about their concept of a world split into more manageable “regions” or “poles,” but we do seem to be approaching the end of an inexorable path toward it. We do not have to take that path. It is not yet set in stone. Carney has openly told us that he and his globalist cronies have not haphazardly stumbled into his proposed SHC, nor have they randomly meandered into the clutches of a multipolar world order or its new IMFS. Conscious, deliberate decisions have been made, and specific steps have been taken, to bring about this state of affairs. There are people who insist that the push toward multipolarity is being led by the BRICS+ nations — in particular, the Russian and Chinese governments. President Putin and Paramount Leader Xi Jinping have been prominent advocates of multipolarity, for sure. Speaking in October 2024 in the lead-up to the 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, Xi explained the multipolar vision. He said it is about fostering “inclusive economic globalization.” This can be done, he noted, by building “solidarity and cooperation” between countries. The BRICS (now BRICS+) project forms a bloc, or “pole,” of nation-states. It has already started to redesign globalism. As pointed out by former Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff, who now chairs the New Development Bank (NDB) at the heart of the BRICS+ project, “measured by GDP, the BRICS countries have already surpassed the G7 in importance.” In truth, a multipolar world order has always been the penultimate destination prior to establishing full-blown, centralised global governance. The evidence supporting this conclusion is abundant. Renowned American historian, professor, and author Carroll Quigley meticulously catalogued the activities of the British/American oligarch network that was inspired by the imperial vision of the early-20th century Rhodes-Milner Group (also known as the Round Table Group). In a 1974 interview with Washington Post reporter Rudy Maxa, Quigley spoke about the “three-power world” that the network envisaged prior to WWII. The idea was that a transatlantic bloc and a united European bloc and an Eastern Soviet bloc would dominate a global “balance of power” structure. Following a 1956 Special Studies Project directed by Henry Kissinger at the request of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a 500-plus-page document titled Prospect for America: The Rockefeller Panel Reports emerged (its copyright spans 1958–1961). The five reports in it aimed to define the problems and opportunities the US faced in the late 1950s, clarify national objectives, and develop a framework on which national policies could be based. The United Nations had already been established in 1945 (the UN headquarters was built on land donated by the Rockefellers), but, according to some of the panel report researchers, this international organisation hadn’t delivered on its goals. So, these researchers returned to the original prospect outlined by the Rhodes-Milner Group and suggested “a world divided into smaller units” [page 26] that would “consist of regional institutions under an international body of growing authority” [page 26]: The most natural multination arrangements are frequently regional. [. . .] Fully developed, they imply a joint accord on monetary and exchange arrangements, a common discipline on fiscal matters, and a free movement of capital and labor. [. . . ] We believe that this regional approach has world-wide validity. [. . .] What is needed immediately is a determination to move in the direction they imply. Regional arrangements are no longer a matter of choice. They are imposed by the requirements of technology, science, and economics. Our course is to contribute to this process by constructive action [pages 188–190]. In October 1968, the Rockefellers supported the foundation of a globalist international policy think tank — the Club of Rome — to implement the “regional arrangements” that they had declared seven years earlier to be “no longer a matter of choice.” The 1973 third symposium of the WEF is considered by the WEF to have been an important moment in its history. At this event, Club of Rome co-founder Aurelio Peccei outlined the Club’s concept of the “sustainability of global economic growth” which, WEF delegates were told, required society to reconcile “economic development and environmental constraints.” Consequently, with this in mind, the WEF adopted “Klaus Schwab’s stakeholder concept.” In same year, September 1973, the Club of Rome wrote a confidential report titled “Regionalized and Adaptive Model of the Global World System.” It proposed that the world be divided into ten “Kingdoms”—comparable to blocs, or poles. Though presented simply as an analytical computer model, the Club of Rome added a vision statement to its report: Our efforts in the immediate future will be concentrated on further use of the already developed [Kingdoms] model. [. . .] Implementation of the regional models in different parts of the world and their connection via a satellite communication network [will be] for the purpose of joint assessment of the long-term global future by teams from the various regions [Kingdoms or “poles”]. Implementation of the vision for the future outlined by leaders from an underdeveloped region in order to assess with the model existing obstacles and the means whereby the [multi-Kingdom or multipolar] vision might become a reality. More recently, World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab co-wrote, with Thierry Malleret, COVID-19: The Great Reset. One point they made in their book is that global supply chains are fragmenting due to global existential crises. They pinned the blame on a lack of cohesive global governance and offered a solution: The most likely outcome along the globalization–no globalization continuum lies in an in-between solution: regionalization. The success of the European Union as a free trade area or the new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in Asia (a proposed free trade agreement among the 10 countries that compose ASEAN) are important illustrative cases of how regionalization may well become a new watered-down version of globalization. [. . .] In short, deglobalization in the form of greater regionalization was already happening. COVID-19 will just accelerate this global divergence as North America, Europe and Asia focus increasingly on regional self-sufficiency rather than on the distant and intricate global supply chains that formerly epitomized the essence of globalization [page 79]. Shortly before the 2025 Munich Security Conference, Trump’s pick for Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave an interview to Megyn Kelly where he said: [. . .] it’s not normal for the world to simply have a unipolar power. [. . .] That was an anomaly. It was a product of the end of the Cold War, but eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet. [. . .] [F]oreign policy has always required us to work in the national interest, sometimes in cooperation with people who we wouldn’t invite over for dinner or people who we wouldn’t necessarily ever want to be led by. And so that’s a balance, but it’s the sort of pragmatic and mature balance we have to have in foreign policy. Casting the multipolar world order as a confrontation between great powers but also a “pragmatic and mature balance,” Rubio’s comments were congruent with the view of the globalist think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)—which has consistently promoted multipolarity. The CFR believes the international rules-based order (the unipolar model) is “disintegrating at an accelerating pace.” CFR fellow Thomas E. Graham sees five potential regional poles in a multipolar global governance system consisting of the US, China, India, Russia, and Europe. The CFR line of thinking is that the US can contribute to multipolarity through foreign policy that seeks to constrain China as a great power; nurture India as a power, preserve Russian power and promote European power. Europe is considered the greatest challenge by the CFR because, despite its economic and possible military might, it “lacks political cohesion.” Therefore, in January 2025 the CFR argued for a new US foreign policy mindset “to encourage Europe to assume the responsibilities of a great power [. . .], one that has the hard power needed to deal with most security contingencies in its immediate neighborhood.” In March 2025, the Trump administration’s very public press conference spat with the visiting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was immediately followed by the US supposedly withholding military aid to Ukraine. This was met with seeming condemnation from the US’ European partners who responded by publicly announcing an €800 billion ($841.5 billion) “ReArm Europe” plan. This gives further impetus to the EU’s long-held desire for European military unification. It seems that Trump’s order not to supply US arms to Ukraine doesn’t apply to Thiel-backed enterprises like Anduril. While Trump was telling American and European voters that the US would not supply arms, Anduril was finalising a deal with the UK government to send their Altius 600m and Altius 700m attack drones to Ukraine. It is hard to say if the press conference between Trump (the former reality TV personality) and Zelenskyy (the former actor and TV comedian) was entirely staged or not. Obviously, both presidents were, at the very least, briefed prior to their quite extraordinary public row. What is not in doubt is that the trajectory of the global policy response is precisely as modelled and suggested by the think-tanks. Elon Musk’s ‘X’ social media platform is, at the time of writing, heavily promoting Trump as the global peace maker who just wants to stop the slaughter in Ukraine. Consequently, the public debate swirling across the entire western media and social media landscape is polarising opinion between those who want peace and those who argue this is short-sighted appeasement and Ukraine must keep fighting to stave off “Putin’s aggression.” Meanwhile, the globalist plans for a multipolar world order are surging ahead regardless of which of those two, pre-determined options is championed by the US or any other government. Political leaders, influential financiers, and representatives of policy think tanks across the West have evidently been planning for some time, even enthusiastically endorsing, construction of a regionalised multipolar world order. Their fundamentally globalist project is the latest iteration of the oligarchs’ persistent dream: global governance under their exclusive control. The Munich Security Conference (MSC) is ostensibly a transatlantic forum where hi-ranking so-called “thought leaders” engage in a “marketplace of ideas.” The self-appointed glitterati discuss, plan and agree security and defence policy trajectories. The theme of MSC 2025 was “Multipolarization.” In the executive summary for the Munich Security Report 2025 we are told that “multipolarization is a fact.” Again, presenting us with the idea that things just happen organically: there is no design. We are given to understand that those who are positive about multipolarity see “opportunities for more inclusive global governance and greater constraints on Washington.” Whereas, those who are more pessimistic believe it “increases the risk of disorder.” The report notes the international enthusiasm for the United Nations 2024 Pact for the Future, replete with its Global Digital Compact and a Declaration on Future Generations. Following the UN’s “quiet revolution,” the Pact is grounded in stakeholder capitalism’s public-private partnerships and “draws on the energy and expertise of governments, civil society and other key partners.” The UN Pact promises more public-private global censorship, centralised world economic and financial control partnerships (global taxation), and firmer mechanisms for global governance partnerships to seize control of nation states as deemed necessary. The MSC thought leaders conclude “for this cooperation [UN Pact] to materialize, the world could well use some ‘depolarization’.” The evident plan is for the global order to undergo a process of creative destruction to deterritorialize it in its current form and reterritorialize it as a more efficient multipolar global governance structure. To this end the MSC report notes: The next four years will show whether a more selectively engaged US fuels or contains global disorder. As other actors will (have to) step up to fill the gap, the multipolarization of the international system could accelerate. Despite US policy decisions supposedly being designed to confront and oppose China, again, as a result of the same US policy decisions, China has shown it is ready to “fill the gap.” In his MSC speech the head of China’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission — China’s foreign minister — H.E. Wang Yi said: [. . .] we should work for an equal and orderly multipolar world. [. . .] China will surely be a factor of certainty in this multipolar system, and strive to be a steadfast constructive force in a changing world. [. . .] The U.N. is at the core of practicing multilateralism and advancing global governance. [. . .] We have firmly upheld the authority and stature of the U.N. J.D. Vance address to the MSC has been reported as harsh criticism of European censorship of its citizen’s and its media, especially with reference to the censorship of US commentators. Within his criticisms, Vance also advocated construction of a European “pole”: [. . .] the Trump administration is very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, and we also believe that it’s important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense. [. . .] [W]e think it’s an important part of being in a shared alliance together that the Europeans step up while America focuses on areas of the world that are in great danger. The extremely rapid response to the US foreign policy shift toward Ukraine has stimulated EU military unification and rearmament. This is entirely in keeping with the strategies and plans laid out by globalist policy think-tanks. Perhaps random events collide and every decision is nothing more than a reaction, but the weight of evidence thoroughly contradicts mere “coincidence theory.” We are supposed to believe that US isolationism is the pessimistic response to multipolarity while the more positive multilateral approach is closer aligned to the essence of the UN’s Pact for the Future. Either way, both pessimistic isolationism and positive multilateralism seem likely to accelerate multipolar global governance. Despite the different approaches, the geopolitical outcomes are seemingly indivisible. Both portend a regionalised world order bureaucracy and this has always been the planned administrative reorganisation of the planet prior to imposing firm global governance and, ultimately, global government. The Trump administration is blatantly declaring its isolationism. Trump, has publicly withdrawn from the World Health Organisation, the Paris Agreement, and the US pact with the OECD to work on a Global Tax Deal. He has imposed international trade tariffs and his toughening of US border security is apparently one of the primary reasons he was re-elected. A lot of what Trump and his staff say is rhetoric and horse-trading. A lot of what Trump and his staff say is rhetoric and horse-trading. OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann has already said Trump’s posturing was interpreted as “concerns raised.” Cormann also said the OECD would “keep working with the U.S. and all countries at the table to support international cooperation that promotes certainty, avoids double taxation, and protects tax bases.” Trump may be haggling for a stronger negotiating position, and we should certainly take his grand statements with a pinch of salt. That said, if we put all this together, what we see is a distinct narrative shift toward polarisation. It is important to stress that we’re witnessing a full-on propaganda offensive. Nevertheless, we are supposed to believe that there are real geopolitical tensions between the EU and the US, not just in relation to Ukraine, but in relation to Greenland. The European Council President António Costa said Denmark had the EU’s “full support” in the Danish government’s alleged confrontation with the US government. Trump has also made aggressive gestures toward BRICS+, warning that tariffs will rain down if the group dumps the USD. Meanwhile, one of he BRICS+ leading nations Russia has said that Trump’s “withdrawal” from the WHO risks “dangerous consequences.” Alexei Kurinney, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Health, said that “from the point of view of protecting exclusively the interests of the United States, this is an isolationist step.” In response to seeming US isolationism, the Chinese government has also criticised the US withdrawals from the WHO and from the Paris Agreement. As we’ve just highlighted, China has offered itself as a reliable global partner to these two entities. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said: China is concerned about the US announcement to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. [. . .] Climate change is a common challenge that all of humanity must face. [. . .] The role of the World Health Organization should only be strengthened, not weakened. The stage is clearly set for the final push toward the multipolar world order. But, strange as it may seem, this very push toward multipolarity is bringing the nations closer to a single global political, economic, and (perhaps most notably) financial and monetary “union.” In other words, multipolarity, as it is presented to us, appears to be a monumental psychological operation (psyop). There have been many attempts over the years to form a North American Union (NAU), which would be composed of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. This geopolitical goal received a boost in 1994 with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but the plan stalled after receiving strong resistance by the populace of all three countries. On and off, the US government has made numerous attempts to pry Greenland away from Denmark — more often than not citing US defence needs. Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Its inhabitants are therefore citizens of Denmark and, by extension, of the European Union. In 1951, the US and Danish governments signed the Defense of Greenland Treaty, which ostensibly appeased US national security concerns. The US maintains the Pituffik Space Base — formerly known as Thule Air Base — on the island of Greenland. Greenland has never been mentioned with respect to any proposed versions of either a North American Union or a free trade agreement. The prospect of building the Praxis gov-corp Technate on Greenland has evidently reignited enthusiasm. The original American technocrats, however, did include Greenland, along with Caribbean island states and Central American states — as far south as the northernmost territory of South America’s Columbia and Venezuela — in their proposed model of a North American Technate. Prior to this year’s inauguration, Trump outlined his dreams of establishing what can only be described as a plan almost geographically identical to Technocracy Inc.’s original North American Technate. In a series of off-the-wall-sounding statements — not unusual for him — Trump indicated that he wanted to add Greenland, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama to a NAU of Mexico, the US, and Canada. He even threatened the use of force, both economic and military, to construct a geopolitical map that is exactly mirrors the aforementioned North American Technate. There is no realistic prospect, in any geopolitical sense, of this imaginary North American Technate actually being formed. But, as we have already discussed, the Dark Enlightenment and Technocracy portend a kind of geopolitics more reminiscent of the system of city states ruled by the Venetian bankers. The Venetian city state was perhaps the most powerful seasteading project the world has ever known. Trumps seemingly weird ideas about seizing control of Gaza and Greenland, as if they can simply be acquired as sovereign states, and where the sovereignty of the people living there is considered “with derision,” is the epitome of the Dark Enlightenment thinking. Forced displacement of the “unthinking demos” is meaningless if you fervently believe “the system must be first.” The North American Technate map that Trump appeared to deliberately outline first appeared on the cover of the Technocracy Study Course. Yet even the original technocrats didn’t explain how all these nation-states would fall in line with their unhinged ideas. Ironically, the technological advances that have today made the prospect of a Technate feasible have also rendered the concept of a geographical Technate moot. By its nature, global communication technology globalises. The technocrats’ notion of a geographically bounded political Technate has largely been subsumed by the globalist oligarchs’ rollout of global governance architecture and technology. The Club of Rome’s Ten Kingdom model was precisely that: a model. While it is obvious there has been a global effort to make that model a functioning reality, it is clear that the gov-corp Technates under construction will first and foremost be economic and financial administrative zones rather than physical or geopolitical nations as we understand them. The technology used to construct each digital state is common to all. Gov-corp realms may be distinct, with, for example, Amazon dominating its sov-corp realm in the West and the Alibaba-Group dominating its sov-corp realm the East, but the “patchwork of realms” will be global. The decentralisation toward the digital city state is the network enabling centralised control. The formation of regionalised poles looks more like bureaucratic reorganisation in preparation for a simplified global governance administration of realms. Nonetheless, the symbology of Trump’s otherwise bizarre imperial statements seems relatively easy to interpret. Trump and/or his close advisers want to make it clear that Technocracy and the Dark enlightenment are the ideas driving the administration. I suspect Trump will say whatever he is told to say, within reason, on this subject or any other. In my opinion, posturing as a would-be emperor probably appeals to his ego. Personally, I doubt Trump even understands what a gov-corp Technate is, but he may. Whatever the case, the communicated signal could not be made more obvious: The neoreactionary technocrats are in control. Thiel and Musk are not the leading architects of the project to establish the global gov-corp Technate. But they are firm believers and, as made men, have been positioned to lead the US in that direction. Ultimately, the digital transformation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution renders the very concept of the nation-state superfluous. The technocrats and accelerationist neoreactionaries know this. Oligarchs have never had an affinity for one nation more than for any other. The system they seek ignores nation-states completely. If their plan succeeds, the only borders that will still have any relevance to them will be those delineating the “Kingdoms” or “poles” of a much-simplified multipolar global governance structure overseeing a network of realms. Once the mycelium-like global financial network is thriving and once seamless cross-border transactions are instantaneous — enabled by a digital SHC fit for a multipolar world — then geographical political borders will cease to have any economic or monetary meaning. As Peter Thiel observed in a 2001 PayPal all-hands meeting: The ability to move money fluidly and the erosion of the nation-state are closely related. The global system of gov-corp Technates that is emerging represents the most oppressive, totalitarian system of absolute behavioural control ever devised. There will be no need for government policy when entire populations — comprised of millions of individual human beings who were born to think for themselves — can be mentally hijacked and literally programmed by corporate behemoths. But of all the psyops foisted upon us, the greatest among them is the millennia-long propaganda campaign to make us believe we are powerless. This is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the “representative democracy” charade. Recognising the staggering audacity of the globalists’ plans and the enormous resources they presently have under their command is not to be “blackpilled.” On the contrary, it is the first step toward liberation. In order to resist the maniacs, we first have to understand what they’re doing and how and why they’re doing it. After that, the only hurdle we must surmount is that of putting all of our own solutions into effect. Our solutions do not have to reimagine the world, we just have to reimagine our tiny portion of it. You don’t need to worry about energy costs if you are energy self sufficient—or as close to it as you can be. You don’t need to be too preoccupied with food prices if you grow it yourself or barter goods and services with those that do, and you don’t need to be overly concerned with exchange rates if you choose your own medium of exchange and trade with other like-minded people in your own community. International financial institutions do not control “money.” Oligarch investors do not control technological development. Governments do not control populations. Only deception, coercion and the use of force ensures these false perceptions. Deception works by bombarding people with propaganda and psyops. Coercion and manipulation are designed to convince us to accept that which we can — and must — decisively reject. Force will almost certainly be used if we do, but there are also eight billion of us. There are better alternatives to top-down oligarch control. Despite the hopes of Musk and Thiel and their ilk, gov-corp Technates are not inevitable. We need only peaceably decline to obey their demented edicts, quit subscribing to their insane schemes, and build something better.

[You may also click here for additional information] Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: An AI stock picker that beat the S&P 500 last year is dumping tech stocks — but holding on to these Magnificent 7 firms

Beating the S&P 500's 23% gain in 2024 was no easy feat, but an AI-backed ETF did just that. Qraft Technologies' AI-Enhanced US Large Cap Momentum ETF (AMOM) finished the year up 38%, thanks to big bets on growth stock winners such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR). But this year's volatile market has led the fund — which uses machine learning models to analyze price trends in the market — to do some severe rebalancing in March, reducing its tech exposure in a big way. AMOM runs on a machine-learning methodology called clustering, which sorts data into similar groups. The algorithm examines the price momentum of large-cap US stocks and rebalances every month, Qraft's ETF lead Justin Tam told Business Insider. "In simple terms, it means that we're looking at previous momentum to see which one is the best predictor of next month," Tam said. A tech-heavy concentration hasn't done the portfolio any favors so far in 2025, as it's down 16% year-to-date. "Going into March, it's gone really bearish on tech," Tam said of the fund. The AI model has reduced its exposure from the tech sector from over 40% last year to just 26% now. Instead of retaining its tech-heavy allocation, the algorithm has diversified more into financials and communications services, picking up companies like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS). The AI fund hasn't completely exited or reduced all of its Big Tech holdings in March, though. In fact, three of its four largest holdings are Magnificent Seven stocks: Nvidia (9.41%), Meta Platforms (6.95%), and Tesla (5.19%). Even though Nvidia beat Wall Street expectations with its earnings report in February of this year, its stock has taken a beating from macroeconomic volatility and technological developments in the AI space. But Tam remains confident in the stock. "We do see a lot of signs for optimism in terms of the long-term growth for Nvidia and the AI trade in general, seeing as the data center revenue has stayed steady, which means that the mega-caps are still investing heavily in AI development," Tam said. As for Tesla, the stock has seen a 48% decline since its mid-December peak, leaving investors uneasy. However, the fund is still holding on, with a 6% allocation to the electric carmaker. "We've seen it pick names that we couldn't make sense of and have it pay off quite a lot," Tam said of the fund's AI algorithm. AI isn't alone in betting on Tesla — the company has supporters on Wall Street, too. Morgan Stanley is overweight on the stock and has classified the company as a top US auto stock pick. The bank isn't too worried about Tesla's decreased sales. "Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics," Adam Jones, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note earlier this month.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Ross Gerber sees no upside to Tesla stock. Here are the trades he's making instead.

Ross Gerber, known as a longtime backer of Tesla, sees no upside in the stock after its latest wipeout. So, where is he seeing opportunity instead? In a recent interview with BI, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management broke down some of his recent market moves amid the ongoing stock correction. Gerber, who is a long-term investor, was hunting for value on Monday when the Nasdaq Composite plunged 4% in its worst day since the 2022 bear market. "I actually bought a little Nvidia yesterday," Gerber said, referencing the Monday sell-off. He also purchased shares of JPMorgan and Meta Platforms during the decline. For Nvidia, it's all about valuation. The AI stock sold off as much as 30% from its January peak amid tariff headwinds and fears of lower-than-expected profit margins. But Gerber highlighted that the stock is trading way too cheap given its elevated growth rate. "You could actually buy Nvidia at 20x earnings and their expected earnings are expected to go up 75% this year and they're buying back stock," Gerber remarked. Bank stocks are also cheap, Gerber said, specifically highlighting JPMorgan as a name he's buying "Banks will have a pretty good year with less regulation, and banks are cheap," Gerber said. JPMorgan is the largest bank in America and currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.2x, a 45% discount to the S&P 500's valuation multiple. Other stocks Gerber had a positive view on included GE Vernova, a renewable energy spin-off from General Electric, TKO Group, which owns UFC and WWE, and Disney. But perhaps the most surprising trade made by Gerber recently was selling the bulk of his bitcoin and using some of the proceeds to buy gold. Gerber said that after years of trading bitcoin, he's learned his lesson about its high volatility and was eager to take profits after the postelection surge. "For my fund, we raised our allocation to 4% and then we made good money on it, so we were up big. But I've learned my lesson over the years trading bitcoin, it's just like I gotta take my money," Gerber said. Regarding gold, Gerber said the uncertainty around the Trump administration should be a tailwind for the risk-off metal. "People buy gold, other countries will buy gold, Europe will buy gold, and just the idea that when you have volatility, there's really only one asset that is meant to really offset that," Gerber said. "It used to be Treasurys and gold, but Treasurys don't actually perform that way as much anymore. I would argue there are substantial risks in Treasurys with this government, so the truth is gold is a really good place if things go crazy," he added. Gold hit a record high of $3,000 an ounce on Friday. The precious metal is up 13% year-to-date.

Captioned Bray v. Rocket Lab USA, Inc., No. 25-cv-01733 (C.D. Cal.), the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit charges Rocket Lab and certain of Rocket Lab’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

CASE ALLEGATIONS: Rocket Lab is a space company that provides launch services and space systems solutions for the space and defense industries. The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (ii) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (iii) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (iv) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner. The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” that alleged, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” On this news, the price of Rocket Lab stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint.
