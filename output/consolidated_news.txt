Title: Harvard Pours $443,000,000 Into Bitcoin As SEC Filing Reveals Massive BlackRock IBIT Purchase

Harvard just poured a major amount of cash into the leading crypto asset, Bitcoin. A new 13F filing with the SEC shows the university’s endowment has boosted its stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to 6,813,612 shares, worth about $443 million as of September 30th. This marks a 257% increase from Q2’s 1.91 million shares, worth $116 million. IBIT now tops Harvard’s US equity holdings, surpassing Microsoft at $323 million and Amazon at $235 million. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas says the move represents a seal of approval for Bitcoin ETFs. “It’s super rare/difficult to get an endowment to bite on an ETF- esp a Harvard or Yale, it’s as good a validation as an ETF can get. That said, half a billion is a mere 1% of total endowment. Big enough to rank 16th among IBIT holders tho.” IBIT now has $81 billion in assets, capturing 35% of all spot Bitcoin ETF inflows.

Title: Bored with index funds? Here are tips for buying individual stocks.

You heard from a friend who bought some stock in Nvidia or Amazon or Apple when it was cheap, and now those shares are worth five or six figures. Those are inspiring stories. But how much can you safely invest in individual stocks? Financial planners advise armchair investors and retirement savers that the smartest move is usually to buy shares of index funds, the kind that track the performance of broad stock indexes or the entire market. Single stocks tend to be much more volatile. But millions of investors buy shares of individual stock, and lots of them have success stories. Is there a place for individual stocks in your retirement portfolio? If so, how much is too much? We asked several investment experts. Ordinary Americans are passionate about investing in individual stocks. A recent survey by the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth found that 54% of low- and moderate-income Americans (those earning $30,000-$80,000 a year) invest in capital markets, and that new investors favor single stocks over mutual funds and ETFs. Investors may watch YouTube and TikTok videos from influencers who claim to have can’t-miss stock picks. They troll the internet for recommendations from The Motley Fool and Morningstar. Then, they sit back and wait for a stock to take off. “There’s a certain element of fun to this,” said Zachary Rayfield, head of goals-based investing research at Vanguard. Ready to buy some individual stocks? Here are a few tips. If you invest in index funds or target-date retirement funds, your investment will probably track the market as a whole. Stock indexes do well in some years, poorly in others, but they are far less mercurial than individual stocks. With single stocks, you’re likely to see big swings, and not always up. If you’re just starting out, experts say, it’s wise to invest only a small share of your portfolio in individual stocks. That’s especially true if you’re investing with your retirement savings. “I think everyone’s retirement should be built on a foundation of index funds,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior retirement adviser at The Motley Fool. “And then you can gradually move into individual stocks,” committing “maybe 5%” of your portfolio. “And then you might find that you absolutely love it, and you can gradually increase that percentage.” However much money you invest in single stocks, investment experts say, try to avoid owning too much of one stock. “A simple rule of thumb is, do not let any one position in your portfolio account for more than 5 to 10% of the overall value of your portfolio,” said Caleb Silver, editor-in-chief of the financial journalism site Investopedia. Overconcentration can happen by accident. Let’s say you bought some shares of Nvidia a few years ago, and you watched them multiply tenfold in value. Today, those shares might make up a large share of your holdings. “Many of our members have 30% of their portfolio in Nvidia,” said Brokamp, whose site has recommended the stock for years. The problem with individual stocks is that “you’re vulnerable to steep declines of your portfolio if one of them goes down significantly,” Silver said. That’s less of a problem if the stock represents 5% of your portfolio, more concerning if it’s 30%. “Individual stocks can be a great way to complement a well-diversified portfolio, but it's important to ensure that no single security overshadows your overall mix,” said Ryan Viktorin, vice president and financial consultant at Fidelity Investments. Diversification, in investment parlance, means holding different kinds of assets. You can diversify by holding stocks in different sectors, large and small companies, American and foreign markets, and by holding things that aren’t stocks, like bonds and money market funds. If you’re devoting only 5% or 10% of your portfolio to single stocks, you don’t necessarily have to worry about diversifying those stocks. To Silver of Investopedia, “it’s better to concentrate on 5 to 10 stocks that you believe in, that have a track record,” and build sizeable holdings in those companies. “If you have invested in any of the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 over the past five years and you have built positions in those companies, you have outperformed the stock market,” Silver said. Case in point: Nvidia. Brokamp of Motley Fool suggests a broader approach. “You should own at least 25 stocks, and they should be diversified,” representing different types of companies, he said. Silver’s approach gives you larger stakes in fewer companies. Brokamp’s gives you more diversification, but you get a smaller stake in each stock. One axiom of investing dictates that actively managed funds often underperform the market as a whole. Simply put: It’s hard to beat the market by picking stocks yourself. And that rule surely applies to amateur stock pickers. “If you do this yourself, you’re becoming an active manager,” said Rayfield of Vanguard. “And a lot of active managers don’t outperform the broader market.” Savvy investors sell off diminished stocks at a loss, then use the loss to offset gains on other investments at tax time, a technique called tax-loss harvesting. Paring down underperforming stocks can leave an investor with an overly rosy view of their success. “If we’re selling the losers, sometimes we get a little high on our horse about what our capabilities are,” said Colin Day, a certified financial planner in St. Louis. “We forget the losers. We only remember the winners.” If you invest in a significant number of single stocks, Brokamp said, expect them to drift in different directions, some rising, some falling. The returns won’t resemble the path of a broad index fund, which captures the collective movement of many stocks. “Many of your individual stocks will be duds,” Brokamp said. “It’s the handful of successes that will drive your return.”

Title: Give a Nazi an Inch… And Other Important Lessons From Weimar, Germany

On January 23, 1930, there was a heated debate in the parliament of the regional state of Thuringia about the formation of a new right-­wing government including one of Hitler’s most ardent followers and a co-­putschist of 1923, Wilhelm Frick, as minister of the interior and public education. The debate began with the former state premier and SPD parliamentary group leader, August Frölich, criticizing the fact that the president of the parliament had taken down the democratic black, red, and gold flag from the building. Was this intended to demonstrate, he asked, “that the colors of the Third Reich under Hitler and Frick should take the place of the national colors?” In Frick, the speaker continued, “a high traitor”—­who had already broken his oath to the constitution as a Bavarian civil servant and who had never made a secret of his opposition to the parliamentary-­democratic system—­“has been appointed a minister in charge of the [regional] constitution.” The fact that Weimar of all places—­the Thuringian capital, in which Germany had adopted its democratic constitution—­served as a springboard to elevate the National Socialists to an important position of power was not a coincidence. Frölich recalled that Frick had pleaded in the Reichstag for amnesty to be given to Ernst Werner Techow, who had been involved in Rathenau’s murder, and had demanded impunity for the Erzberger assassins, Schulz and Tillessen. He reminded the DVP, which wanted to join the right-­wing government, that not long ago, in December 1929, Frick had vilified the late Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann as a paid foreign agent for accepting the Nobel Peace Prize. Repeatedly interrupted by the National Socialists, Frölich concluded his speech with the words: “The election of Mr. Frick makes today a day of political and cultural shame for Thuringia.” That afternoon DVP parliamentary group leader Georg Witzmann tried to justify his party’s stance. Despite considerable reservations, he said, his party had decided to join the government in the spirit of cooperating with all parties “who have the goodwill to serve our country with their work.” Frick had promised to swear an oath to the constitution and also declared that he would drop his accusations of corruption against Stresemann. A firewall on the political right was out of the question for the Thuringian DVP. On the contrary, Witzmann said, the National Socialists were “ideologically and politically closer” to the DVP than the Social Democrats were. In the end, the government was confirmed by 28 votes to 22 from the SPD, KPD, and DDP. Frick became the first National Socialist minister of a regional German government. The fact that Weimar of all places—­the Thuringian capital, in which Germany had adopted its democratic constitution—­served as a springboard to elevate the National Socialists to an important position of power was not a coincidence. After the interlude of the Thuringian united-­front leftist government of the SPD and KPD in the fall of 1923, which ended with the Reich intervening there and in Saxony, the Right had begun to gain strength. The “Thuringian Order League”—­a conglomeration of the DNVP, DVP, and Thuringian Rural League—­emerged as the strongest force in the state elections on February 10, 1924. However, with thirty-­five of seventy-­two state parliamentary seats, it fell short of a majority and therefore had to rely on being tolerant of the Popular-­Ethnic Social Bloc, a successor organization to the then-­banned Nazi Party, which surprised everyone by winning 9.3 percent of the vote and seven parliamentary seats. In the city of Weimar itself, it had even received almost twice as many votes, with 18.6 percent. One of the new government’s first measures was to cut funding for Walter Gropius’s unpopular Bauhaus in Weimar. In response, the director and the “masters,” as the instructors were known, declared their contracts with the state of Thuringia null and void. The world-­famous architecture and art school found a new home in Dessau, the capital of the regional state of Anhalt. In contrast to previous quarrels within the far-­right ethnic nationalist movement, the Nazi Party presented a new unity, tightly focused on the “Führer” as the undisputed integrating leader. It was the minister of the interior in this conservative–­extreme right government who in February 1925, after the reestablishment of the Nazi Party, lifted a nationwide ban on Hitler speaking publicly. Gradually, Thuringia replaced Bavaria as the primary stomping ground for the Far Right. “Nowhere in Germany did Hitler, the Nazis, the racist antisemites, the military associations, and extreme nationalists find a better place for their activities,” historian Karsten Rudolph has concluded. In March 1925, Hitler gave his first speeches in Weimar at several packed events. Further appearances followed in October 1925. When in the city, the party leader preferred to stay at the Hotel Elephant, the traditional hotel on the market square, which rolled out the red carpet early on. The hospitality he received was one reason that, after the ban on him speaking was rescinded, Hitler decided to convene the NSDAP’s first Reich Party Conference in early July 1926 in Weimar. In contrast to previous quarrels within the far-­right ethnic nationalist movement, the Nazi Party presented a new unity, tightly focused on the “Führer” as the undisputed integrating leader. On the afternoon of July 4, Hitler was allowed to speak at the Deutsches Nationaltheater—­the same venue where Friedrich Ebert had opened the National Assembly on February 6, 1919, and where the National Constituent Assembly had met. “Where Ebert once sat, today Adolf Hitler sits and stands,” boasted the gauleiter, or Nazi regional leader, Arthur Dinter, at a “general roll call” of the SA (Sturmabteilung) and SS. “This is the beginning of a new era.” In September 1927, Hitler dismissed Dinter, who was also the author of the antisemitic bestseller Die Sünde wider das Blut (The sin against blood), from his post because his sectarian idea of restoring the “pure doctrine of salvation” was upsetting people in the party leader’s circles. As his replacement, Hitler appointed the former managing director Fritz Sauckel, an unconditional true believer who would enjoy a long career. It was also in the Weimar Nazi Party administration that an inconspicuous functionary began a career as a cashier and accountant, which would see him become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich. His name was Martin Bormann. Likewise, the young Baldur von Schirach, a son of the last grand-­ducal theater director, also found his way to Hitler in Weimar. He wrote verses of homage to the Führer, who would later, in October 1931, appoint him Reich Youth Leader of the Nazi Party. Along with the racist literary historian and avowed antisemite Adolf Bartels and his pupil Hans Severus Ziegler, deputy gauleiter since 1925, it was Schirach who gave Hitler access to conservative, upper-­middle-­class circles in the city. “I love Weimar,” Hitler proclaimed in 1928. “I need Weimar like I need Bayreuth. And the day will come when I’ll give this city and its theater a lot more support. I still have big plans for Weimar and Bayreuth.” Although the Nazis won only six seats in the regional parliament, they were still in a key position. The Nazis took 11.3 percent of the vote in the Thuringian state elections on December 8, 1929. This was more than three times as much as in the regional elections in February 1927 (3.5 percent). In Weimar, they got no less than 23.8 percent. Their success wasn’t accidental. Under Sauckel’s leadership, the party had built up a powerful machine and had aggressively campaigned and stirred up unrest in small rural Thuringian communities. Its success came primarily at the expense of the mainstream parties—­a sign of how voter behavior was shifting and a harbinger of the coming landslide in the Reichstag elections of September 14, 1930. The Berliner Tageblatt was thus very wrong when it dismissed the result as “a fad surrounded by carnival hype that has to be tolerated.” Although the Nazis won only six seats in the regional parliament, they were still in a key position. As in 1924, the mainstream parties of the center and right lacked a majority. Their twenty-­three seats (Rural Association: nine; Business Party: six; DVP: five; DNVP: two; DDP: one) were outweighed by the twenty-­four seats for the SPD (eighteen) and the KPD (six). Since they had ruled out a coalition with the Social Democrats, they needed the support of the six National Socialist MPs to form a government. This time around, Hitler did not want merely to tolerate a coalition. On the contrary, from the very outset, he wanted to be part of the government. Hitler was unusually frank about his motives in a letter, dated February 2, 1930, to a supporter of the Nazi movement living overseas, in which he noted a “great turnaround” in the public perception of Nazism. It was “astonishing how the knee-­jerk, arrogant, snobbish, or stupid rejection of the party of just a few years ago has given way to expectations and hope.” However, he added, such hope would be disappointed if they were to remain in the opposition out of principle. But in return for the party’s participating in coalition negotiations, Hitler demanded two key posts, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of National Education. “The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for the entire administration, the personnel department, that is, the appointment and dismissal of all civil servants and the police. The Ministry of Public Education is responsible for the entire school system, from elementary schools to the University of Jena, as well as the theater system. Whoever is in possession of these two ministries and uses his power ruthlessly and persistently can achieve extraordinary things.” Hitler was thus interested not only in participating in government but in taking over the executive from within. “We will pass the first test of our mettle,” predicted Berlin gauleiter and later Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels on January 8, 1930. Hitler added that “only a National Socialist through and through with both great expertise and unconditional National Socialist convictions” could be considered as a candidate to take over the dual ministry. Fresh elections were the last thing the mainstream parties wanted, since they were sure to further strengthen the Nazi Party. Hitler believed he had found the right person in Frick, an early party supporter, the former head of the political division in the Munich police headquarters, and the acting chairman of the Nazi parliamentary group in the Reichstag, calling him “an energetic, bold, and responsible civil servant of extraordinary ability and a fanatical National Socialist!” Initially, the DVP rejected the ministerial appointment of someone who had taken part in the 1923 putsch and been convicted of high treason. “So I went to Weimar myself,” Hitler reported in the letter on February 2, “and succinctly assured the gentlemen in no uncertain terms that either Dr. Frick would become our minister, or fresh elections would be held.” Fresh elections were the last thing the mainstream parties wanted, since they were sure to further strengthen the Nazi Party. Hitler gave his prospective mainstream parties a deadline of three days, from January 10 to 13. Otherwise, he would have a motion introduced to dissolve the regional parliament. But the DVP still had its scruples. Hitler was in a strong bargaining position, however, and he furthered his cause with a speech to leading representatives of Thuringia’s business and industry associations on January 10, which made a huge impression. “In the evening, Hitler spoke to a closed circle,” a very satisfied Goebbels noted. “In front of 150 bigwigs, reeking of respectability. Hitler spoke fabulously. I’ve rarely heard him that good.” Business circles were also ramping up pressure on the DVP, and when the ultimatum expired, the party caved in. On January 23, 1930, the coalition government was confirmed in office. “Frick is now a minister in Weimar,” Goebbels recorded in his diary. “It was a difficult birth.” Frick’s party comrade Wilhelm Marschler was appointed state councillor, a position that gave him a vote in the cabinet. There was no lack of warning voices in the DVP. “It hurts my soul to see you in such company,” shouted DVP Reichstag deputy Siegfried von Kardorff to the delegates from Thuringia at the party’s conference in Mannheim in March 1930. But the fact that the DVP was doing deals with the Nazis at all showed how far the party had drifted to the right under Stresemann’s successor, Ernst Scholz. Making common cause with the National Socialists at regional level while being part of a grand coalition with the Social Democrats at Reich level was a complete contradiction. In that respect, the Thuringian experiment already foreshadowed the imminent demise of Hermann Müller’s government. Hitler demanded, “In the same vein, we will purge the teaching staff of Marxist-­democratic elements just as we will adapt the curriculum to our National Socialist beliefs and ideas.” Minister Frick did not disappoint expectations. At the third reading of the laws to enact the Young Plan in the Reichstag on March 12, 1930, he took a seat on the benches of the state representatives and made a statement of vigorous protest immediately before the final vote, railing against the “Enslavement Act,” the adoption of which would bring “the greatest national misfortune and end the independence of Germany’s regional states.” The Thuringian Ministry of State had not authorized him to make this statement. Although the DVP parliamentary group leader, Witzmann, disapproved of his unilateral action a few days later, Frick faced no consequences. Hitler had set his party colleague two tasks. As Thuringian minister of the interior, Frick was to “carry out a slow purge of the administrative and civil service from all red revolutionary elements.” There was “a great deal to do,” Hitler said, especially in policing. And as minister of national education, he was to push ahead with the “nationalization of the school system.” Hitler demanded, “In the same vein, we will purge the teaching staff of Marxist-­democratic elements just as we will adapt the curriculum to our National Socialist beliefs and ideas.” Frick set to work with great energy to remake Thuringia in this sense. In his inaugural speech to the civil servants in his two ministries, he made it clear that a “new spirit” now applied in Weimar, and that it would be fundamentally different from the “treacherous November spirit” of the German republic. On March 18, 1930, he introduced to the state parliament the draft of an enabling act intended to largely free the state government from parliamentary control for six months. The law was passed by a simple majority (28 votes to 25) on March 29. Under the guise of reforming and streamlining the administration, civil servants loyal to the republic were dismissed and replaced by followers of the NSDAP. The Reich government, however, did not stand idly by as Frick went about doing what he did. On March 18, 1930, the Social Democratic Minister of the Interior Carl Severing informed the Thuringian government that he had received news “giving rise to justified doubts as to whether the conditions for the granting of a Reich subsidy for police purposes” were still fulfilled. Thuringian State Premier Erwin Baum from the Rural League “solemnly appealed” to the Reich not to block the funds. The Nazi battle cry “Germany awaken” was intended to instill nationalism in schoolchildren. Although the new minister of the interior, Joseph Wirth of the Center Party, who had been in office since March 30, 1930, reached an agreement with the Thuringian state government in April to lift the ban on the Reich subsidy, no agreement was reached on the fundamental question of whether National Socialists should be allowed to join the police force. Frick created a fait accompli by filling the offices of the police directorates of Weimar and Gera with his allies. When Wirth then had police funds blocked again in June 1930, Baum filed a complaint with the State Court in Leipzig. The conflict between Thuringia and the Reich was settled in December 1930, when the former guaranteed the “nonpolitical conduct of individual civil servants without fail while on duty” and the latter agreed to lift the freeze on police subsidies. Frick was unperturbed by all the objections from Berlin and continued his policy of “cleansing” the civil service. Goebbels, who visited him in Weimar at the beginning of June 1930, was impressed: “He is in good spirits, has the courage of his convictions, provokes people, and behaves insolently toward the bigwigs in Berlin. A true German minister indeed.” Civil servants who were members of or close to the SPD were hit particularly hard by the staff cuts the state of Thuringia also had to make due to the precarious financial situation. Frick appointed three of his party comrades to the Ministry of Education, including the deputy gauleiter Hans Severus Ziegler, as “expert advisers.” They acted as a kind of shadow government, with access to personnel files, which they used to tar-­brush undesirables among the teaching ranks. Suspicion and denunciation became pervasive in the Thuringian administration. Parallel to his administrative and personnel purges, Frick set about to radically change the country’s cultural policy. On April 16, 1930, school prayers were reintroduced by a decree in the official gazette of the Ministry of National Education. The reason given was that “forces alien to the species and people” had long been trying to “destroy the spiritual, moral, and religious foundations of our German thinking and feeling in order to uproot the German people and thus make it easier to control us,” the decree stated. The German people could resist these pernicious influences only “if they kept the religious and moral driving forces of their nature pure and passed them on to the next generations of youth.” Three of the suggested prayers were clearly directed against the democratic constitutional order of the Weimar Republic, which was viewed as anathema to the spirit of ethnic jingoism. The second of these rhyming prayers went: Father, in your almighty hand Stand our people and fatherland You were our ancestors’ honor and strength You are our constant weapon and defense Therefore free us from betrayal and deceit Make us strong for the liberating deed Give us the Savior’s heroic bravery Let honor and freedom be our highest commodity! Let our vow and watchword be: Germany, awaken! Lord, make us free! May God make it so! The Nazi battle cry “Germany awaken” was intended to instill nationalism in schoolchildren. Frick left no doubt as to who was meant by the “forces alien to the species and people” in the state parliament in May 1930. The “prayers for freedom,” he explained, were intended to serve as a “defense against the fraud” that had been “committed against the German people by Marxism and the Jews.” The Nazis’ coalition partners offered little opposition to the mandatory bastardized school prayers, and protests from the Thuringian Teachers’ Association and the Protestant regional church were also limited. Conversely, the coalition parties shot down a motion by the SPD parliamentary group to rescind the decree. Frick did, however, lose a lawsuit filed with the Leipzig State Court. In its ruling of July 11, 1930, three particularly offensive prayers were rejected because they impinged on the “sensibilities of dissenters” and thus violated Article 148, paragraph 2, of the Reich Constitution. Before that, in February 1930, Frick had issued an injunction against Erich Maria Remarque’s famous anti-­war novel All Quiet on the Western Front, which had been published in spring 1929 and quickly become a bestseller. School boards in Thuringia were instructed to report which schools had purchased the title and which teachers had used the book in class. Further inclusion of the book in reading lists was prohibited. These regulations were in line with the views of the German Fighting League for German Culture, which had been founded in August 1927 under the leadership of the Nazi Party’s chief ideologue, Alfred Rosenberg. At its Whitsunday conference in Weimar in 1930, held under Frick’s patronage, the league demanded that the “German will to self-­defense must be hardened.” Nazi cultural watchdogs considered Remarque’s bestseller capable of impairing that “will.” The same strictures also applied to the film version of the novel. The Nazi Party, led by Goebbels as the gauleiter of the German capital, railed against the film, which premiered in Berlin in December 1930, and on December 11, the Supreme Film Board gave in to SA intimidation and banned it. “The Nazi street fighter is dictating the government’s actions,” crowed Hitler’s propaganda expert. Frick’s next serious intervention in cultural life came at the beginning of April 1930 with the decree “Against Negro Culture and for German Ethnic Identity.” In its preamble, it claimed that for years, “foreign racial influences,” capable of “undermining the moral fortitude of the German people,” had been “increasingly asserting themselves in almost all cultural areas.” It was therefore “in the interest of the preservation and strengthening of the German ethnic identity” that everything “glorifying Negroism” should be seen as “signs of decay” to be “prevented as much as possible.” The authorities were to apply the “strictest standards” and punish all theater companies that could not be regarded as “morally or artistically reliable.” This decree provided the basis for numerous bans. For example, the performance of Friedrich Wolf’s abortion drama, Cyanide, which Erwin Piscator’s Berliner Ensemble wanted to stage in Gera and Jena, was prohibited. Plays by the expressionists Ernst Toller and Walter Hasenclever also disappeared from the repertoire of state theaters. On May 22, 1930, SPD member of parliament Max Greil, a former minister of popular education, excoriated Frick in front of the Thuringian state parliament, castigating him for trying to politicize all areas of cultural life “along the lines of National Socialist Party beliefs.” Frick’s “proclamation against Negro culture,” Greil argued, was actually directed against Jews, and he demanded that Frick publicly acknowledge this fact. Contrasting Nazi cultural policy with the “classical spirit of cosmopolitanism in the sense of Goethe,” Greil said, “It is the spirit of nationalist narrow-­mindedness; it is the spirit of chauvinist warmongering.” There was hardly any resistance in Weimar to this “storming of paintings,” as it became known. In his infamous decree, Frick had announced that he had appointed the architect Paul Schultze-­Naumburg as the new director of the Vereinigte Kunstlehranstalten (College of Architecture, Fine Arts, and Crafts) in Weimar and that it was to be developed into a “center of German culture.” Schultze-­Naumburg, whom Frick had also hired as an “art consultant,” had made a name for himself as a vehement opponent of the Bauhaus and advocate of a “racially sound” German culture. His house in Saaleck near Bad Kösen, located below the castle ruins, was a popular meeting place for extreme right-­wing nationalist circles. In June 1930, Goebbels was a guest there. He was accompanied by Frick and Walther Darré, later the Nazi food minister. “The Schultze house is beautifully situated above the Saale River, wonderfully blended into the landscape, a true gem,” noted Goebbels in his diary. “I have never seen such a stylish house.” While in the town, the Berlin gauleiter did not neglect to visit the graves of Fischer and Kern, the men who had murdered Walther Rathenau. In his speech inaugurating the newly designed Vereinigte Kunstlehranstalten on November 10, 1930, Schultze-­Naumburg raged against modern art, which, he claimed, consisted “only of obscure, tortured, and distorted images and the visualization of mental and physical inferiority.” He was united with Germany’s youth, he added, in the goal of “chasing all those corrupters of and traitors to the people out of the German house, in which they have no place.” Deeds followed these words. That October, Schultze-­Naumburg had wall frescoes by Bauhaus master Oskar Schlemmer painted over in the Van de Velde building. In early November, at Frick’s behest, seventy works by modern artists, including paintings and drawings by Otto Dix, Lyonel Feininger, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee, were removed from the exhibition rooms of the Weimar Palace Museum. Frick justified this preview of the Nazis’ infamous 1937 campaign against “degenerate art” by claiming that the ostracized works had “nothing in common with Nordic-­German nature” and only “depicted eastern and other inferior subhumanity.” There was hardly any resistance in Weimar to this “storming of paintings,” as it became known. But the liberal Berlin press, including the Berliner Tageblatt, branded it for what it was: “a scandal in a cultured nation.” But even this scandal was surpassed by Frick’s most audacious coup: the appointment of the racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther as a professor at the University of Jena. In doing so, Frick was acting on Hitler’s expectations in a letter of February 2, 1930, in which the Nazi leader had envisaged the “establishment of a chair for racial issues and racial studies” in Jena as the “first step” in the desired “intellectual upheaval.” Hitler himself had suggested Günther, the author of a “racial primer of the German people,” for the position. When the university rector, church historian Karl Heussi, opposed Frick’s request, the students’ association, already dominated by National Socialist sympathizers, rebelled. Frick praised the Jena student body for having shown “more understanding for the need to create the conditions necessary for Germany’s renewal” than the professors. The only concession made to the university’s teaching staff was that the original title—­Chair of Human Civilization—­was changed to Chair of Social Anthropology. Hitler personally attended Günther’s inaugural lecture, on November 15, 1930, which was entitled “The Causes of the Racial Decline of the German People Since the Migration of Peoples.” On April 1, 1931, Frick’s time in government in Thuringia came to an abrupt end, after the DVP joined a motion of no confidence proposed by the Social Democrats and Communists. Yet it was not Frick’s actions as a minister that caused the coalition to break up, but rather the insulting remarks made by Gauleiter Sauckel in an editorial in the party newspaper Der Nationalsozialist (The National Socialist). After Frick resigned in the run-­up to the Reich presidential election in spring of 1932, it became known that he had secretly attempted to obtain German citizenship for Hitler. In it, Sauckel had belittled representatives of the DVP as “foolish old men, traitors, and swindlers,” who “in their bottomless impudence were playing a sacrilegious game with the fate of our people.” This proved too much even for a party that had endured months of Frick’s provocations. Amid considerable press attention, Hitler had traveled to Weimar the day before the vote to try to change the DVP’s mind, but his trip was in vain. In the parliamentary debate preceding the no-­confidence motion on April 1, Philipp Kallenbach of the DDP described the results of Frick’s fourteen months in government as “downright disastrous.” Kallenbach said: “Peace in our state has been destroyed. The driving force behind these administrative measures is the desire to stir up people and create a spectacle, even to encourage hatred and take one-­sided actions against broad segments of the population. To a great extent in the short time in question, all areas of public life have been politicized in the interests of the Nazi Party. To advance those ends, personnel policy has been ruthless, with allies being permitted to feed at the trough more openly and self-­evidently than ever before.” After Frick resigned in the run-­up to the Reich presidential election in spring of 1932, it became known that he had secretly attempted to obtain German citizenship for Hitler. The affair caused a sensation. A parliamentary inquiry, chaired by SPD politician Hermann Brill, was formed in Weimar to investigate, and Hitler and Frick were summoned as witnesses. The picture that emerged started in the summer of 1930. With State Premier Baum away on vacation, Frick had sought to lay the groundwork for Hitler’s naturalization by appointing him gendarmerie commissioner in the town of Hildburghausen, while at the same time releasing him from all duties as a civil servant. Two ministry officials were ordered to initiate the necessary formalities under “strictest official secrecy.” The grotesque story of Frick’s attempted naturalization of Hitler quickly became the talk of the town. At a regional Nazi meeting in Gera on July 12, 1930, Frick presented Hitler with the certificate of appointment, and he confirmed receipt with his signature. Afterward, however, the Nazi leader apparently had second thoughts, worrying that the title of gendarmerie commissioner might make him look ridiculous. In any case, he tore up the document a few days later in Munich. Before the committee of inquiry, he testified that he had not wanted to accept the appointment in the first place. The grotesque story of Frick’s attempted naturalization of Hitler quickly became the talk of the town. “Lots of hounding in the press,” an annoyed Goebbels noted. “Crazy caricatures.” The affair was mocked as a “presumptuous masquerade” and a “prank.” But an editorial in the liberal Vossische Zeitung drew attention to the deadly serious underlying meaning. With his “unsuccessful push” to make Hitler a German, Frick had once again proved that the National Socialists were unwilling to abide by the law. “It would be good if the true character of this party were finally recognized outside Bavaria, where people have experienced it up close,” the paper wrote. In Thuringia, no one heeded the warning. In the state elections in late July 1932, the NSDAP emerged as the strongest party, with 42.5 percent of the vote, and Sauckel became state premier. Looking back, the Social Democratic politician, journalist, and later member of the anti-­Nazi resistance Hermann Brill described the “Frick era” in Thuringia as “one of the most important vanguard skirmishes in the great battle between democracy and dictatorship.” Indeed, during his time in office, Frick delivered a foretaste of what could be expected if the National Socialists came to power nationally. For fourteen months, Thuringia served as a laboratory in which they could try out measures they were to implement on a larger scale at Reich level three years later. In a personal letter dated April 2, 1931, Hitler thanked Frick for “placing Thuringia at the center of Germany’s national, political, and economic redevelopment.” The Nazi leader added, “We all firmly believe in the hour that will once again, this time forever, call you to serve our people in a responsible position.” And Frick was in fact rewarded with the post of Reich minister of the interior—­one of the most powerful positions in the land—­in the “cabinet of national concentration” formed on January 30, 1933, under Germany’s new chancellor, Hitler. __________________________________ Excerpted from Fateful Hours: The Collapse of the Weimar Republic.

Title: The new business deals, Zelensky, the…sea bass and the Pax Americana, how the M.M. treats Samaras, Metlen’s new acquisition and the sale of Iktinos

Hello, some thoughts on today’s anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising. Usually, all over the world, after a few years have passed from a historic event for a country, the state, the protagonists—if they are still alive—and society honor that very event with ceremonies of remembrance and respect, some tributes, but generally with peaceful demonstrations of collective memory. In Greece, 52 years later, the day of the uprising of students and other citizens against the Junta becomes an occasion to smash and wreck Athens, to destroy with paint the…martyr-like (in every sense) façade of the Polytechnic and, by the end of the day, to burn…a few shops in the center of Athens with Molotov cocktails, right in front of the eyes of thousands of stunned tourists who are still enjoying—mid-November—the blessed Greek weather. If this is what we want half a century later, let us reflect on it. But I think that the overwhelming majority of people do not want this, without it meaning that they do not honor the people who rose up then against the Junta and who either risked or lost their lives. Business and Pax Americana Beyond that, everything we have seen for the past 15 days happening in Athens regarding the geopolitical and business agreements with the USA was completed yesterday with the arrival of Zelensky, who came to sign that Ukraine will procure—via Greece—American LNG. As for the rest of what he is asking, mainly in weapons and such, I don’t think he will get it, and I think the most substantial meeting he had here yesterday was with Ambassador Guilfoyle regarding the agreement, and not only that, since of course he is very interested in the direct and effective access she has to the President of the United States. In any case, let me repeat that for the last three weeks the “American factor” has been steadily here, building deals and business agreements, and is not in Turkey, with whatever that implies. But mainly, what interests everyone is the security of the country against Turkey, which, of course, is primarily ensured by the Americans. That “I am here” which Guilfoyle said recently at the Greece Talks conference last Friday, when she was asked about the Eastern threat, is currently linked with the “Vertical Corridor,” which not only passes through Greece but is the entry gate for American natural gas into Europe. Sea bass and LNG I should tell you that the atmosphere yesterday at the Maximos Mansion was very warm, while K.M. had also planned to host Zelensky and the Ukrainian delegation. After the statements and the signing of the gas agreement, there was a lunch for the two delegations, with a menu of sea bass with greens and bouillabaisse, and I hear that Zelensky didn’t drink wine. Now, I don’t know whether he liked the sea bass, but the agreement for the supply of gas was certainly crucial for him, as winter in Ukraine is baring its teeth. This agreement was essentially the follow-up to the agreement announced at P-TEC for the AKTOR–DEPA partnership for LNG transport, and it will go into operation at the end of December. Immediate profits from LNG for AKTOR Taking the opportunity from what we said earlier, let me add an important business tip. As announced, DEPA Commercial and Naftogaz of Ukraine yesterday signed a Declaration of Intent for the supply of natural gas to the Ukrainian market for the winter period, from December 2025 to March 2026. The agreement stipulates that the transport of LNG from the USA will be carried out via “Route 1,” which has been allocated to the Transmission System Operators (TSOs). If we “translate” the announcement in business terms, it means that the interstate agreement will be executed via Atlantic-See LNG Trade (of Venture Global, AKTOR, and DEPA). Consequently, the trade of American LNG starts immediately, from mid-December, and not in 2030—something that means that AKTOR’s 60% subsidiary will already begin to produce results for its balance sheet from early 2026, since the results of Atlantic-See LNG are consolidated into those of AKTOR. In other words, the AKTOR group begins to record profits from the new activity much earlier. Kimberly and the drones As for energy matters and Greece’s decision to play the card of this agreement, do not overlook the role of Kimberly Guilfoyle, who has come to Greece with a clear agenda, which she described last Friday at Greece Talks. Let me add, parenthetically, that her interview generated a lot of discussion and she herself was satisfied because she conveyed clear messages. Beyond that, this time there was little discussion about weapons in the foreground, but something is moving in the background. For example, I do not consider it coincidental that the Chief of the Hellenic National Defense General Staff, Choupis, was present yesterday at noon at the Maximos Mansion, as he participated in the extended meeting of the delegations. The Ukrainians are definitely asking for weapons that we cannot provide, such as Patriots. But we do have some “decommissioned” Russian weapons that have not been supported for some years now. I hear that the Ukrainians have begun to put on the table the provision of Ukrainian drones to our country in return, but an agreement is still a way off. The interview on ERT Before departing for Singapore on Wednesday (he will return on Saturday), K.M. is expected, as I hear, to give an in-depth, wide-ranging interview. It will be on the morning show of ERTNews (Papachlimintzos–Douka), his first appearance on public television since the launch of the new news channel. Whether it will be Tuesday or Wednesday will likely be “locked in” today. Stamatis and Mitsotakis Yesterday, after a hard battle with cancer, Dimitris Stamatis passed away—a modest, serious, and always conciliatory politician, a close friend of Antonis Samaras. I was struck by the excerpt in Mitsotakis’ condolence statement: “…when we served together in the government under Antonis Samaras.” A similar statement was made by Skertsos, referring to his presence in the 2012–14 government: “…when we kept the country together during the difficult years under the guidance of A. Samaras and E. Venizelos.” I have the impression that the entire New Democracy party, from K.M. down to the rank-and-file members, will view Samaras in a completely opposite way from how he views them—and especially the Prime Minister. Pavlos Marinakis Pavlos Marinakis’ bill regarding ERT, the media it regulates, their long-standing pending issues, and also the rule of law, passed triumphantly through Parliament’s competent committees on Friday, and all the relevant sector bodies spoke highly of it—even those… politically opposed. Tsapanidou from SYRIZA, as well as almost the rest of the opposition, were against it, proving why these people are “elsewhere” and generally unable to understand that blanket refusal leads nowhere. METLEN submits an offer, PPC goes to London for the business plan Moving on to market news—which today I assume will shift into a different pattern after the Fitch upgrade and the news from Euronext. The week begins with significant business developments from major groups and smaller listed companies. First of all, today METLEN submits its financial offer for the acquisition of the aluminum plant in Dunkirk. If the bet pays off, the profile of the metallurgy sector for METLEN will change, with the group adding to the sector (based on last year’s results) an annual EBITDA of about €300 million and net profits of €150 million. The baton is passed on Wednesday to PPC, which is presenting in London the business plan that is said to involve investments of over €10 billion for the period 2026–2028. The focus is on whether PPC’s announcements will confirm the recent market rumors of a roughly €1 billion capital increase at €14 per share, combined with interest from BlackRock in acquiring a significant stake. Preliminary agreement between IKTINOS and a fund Since I mentioned smaller listed companies earlier, let me add that the management of IKTINOS is taking steps to leverage its assets with the goal of freeing the listed company from debt. In this context, according to information, IKTINOS is said to have reached a preliminary agreement with a foreign fund for the 2,500-acre property it owns in the Faneromeni bay in Sitia, Crete. Developments are expected immediately. National Insurance acquisition by December 5 The acquisition of 100% of National Insurance by Piraeus Bank is in its final stretch, as the Bank of Greece has granted approval and next week approval is also expected from the SSM. By December 5, based on the dates given by the authorities, the acquisition will have been completed, and the second essential chapter begins for the insurance company but also for the banks (Piraeus Bank and National Bank) in terms of bancassurance. I’m no prophet, but something tells me that this chapter will not be exhausted “from one moment to the next,” as we say. It will require a lot of groundwork both from Piraeus Bank and from the National Bank. It is a structural change that reshapes long-standing relationships with many technical and legal issues, and some time will be needed before it wraps up. Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) in the arms of Euronext Now regarding HELEX, which we mentioned above: last Thursday and especially Friday, individual small shareholders of HELEX showed that they are convinced by the Public Offer of Stéphane Boujnah and handed over their shares to brokerage firms, which in turn mobilized even more because of the special 0.4% commission they had on the transaction. Today at 2 p.m. the process formally closes, with the acceptance rate—according to market information—expected to exceed 55% and move toward 60%. Success is considered a given, but the column reserves judgment on the exact percentage. What is certain is that the strategy paid off: institutional investors—Greek and foreign funds that already held Euronext shares—hurried to exchange. For them, the transition was a simple administrative move without tax implications. Individuals acted on Thursday and Friday. The fact is that after the results are announced the day after tomorrow, November 19, the Athens Stock Exchange enters the pan-European network. On November 24, HELEX shares will be traded simultaneously in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon, and Paris. The next chapter is the squeeze-out: Euronext will seek 90% or more so as to integrate HELEX into the group. Byte: heading for EBITDA over €10 million in the 9-month period Byte, as IDEAL presented last October during Investor Day, is transforming into the parent company for its IT investments, with subsidiaries Adacom and Bluestream. According to information, the picture of the 9-month results follows a trajectory similar to that of the first half. If we compare these figures, then we expect revenue above €75 million and EBITDA above €10 million. I hear that the company’s executives are very pleased because the gross profit margin is increasing by more than 7 points and the EBITDA margin is stabilizing at 15%, over 4% higher than last year. They also say that the contribution of projects carried out by the companies abroad is significant and represents a new pillar for future growth. IDEAL’s results on Thursday, 20/11, will likely confirm management’s expectations as presented in October. The next step is to see whether the strong results will be reflected in the share price and whether IT sector valuations will help IDEAL. Swiss-franc loans: institutionally yes… technically maybe The Ministry of National Economy and Finance is working full-time on the institutional framework for the restructuring of Swiss-franc loans, listening to the banks but clearly keeping its focus on the borrowers. The legislative framework is expected to be ready by the end of the year. However, its implementation may require a longer time. The technical aspect of implementation is not the simplest. It is therefore very likely that the platform of the out-of-court settlement mechanism will be used for the Swiss-franc loan restructurings. The adjustments required to allow both vulnerable and non-vulnerable borrowers to enter are technically complex and may require some time. Even if a new application is developed to serve this purpose, it too will need time. Giannis Mytilineos’ new companies “Sea Front Bliss I” and “Sea Front Bliss II” are the names of the two new companies founded last Friday, November 14, and are owned by businessman Giannis Mytilineos. The purpose of the two companies, headquartered in Varibombi, is—among other things—the buying and selling and management of real estate and, in particular, the construction of buildings either for own use or for exploitation in any way, or for resale, located anywhere in Greece or abroad. Also, the construction, leasing, subleasing, renovation, repair, expansion, maintenance, exploitation, management and general utilization of all kinds of properties, urban or otherwise, owned by the company or third parties; the establishment, construction, operation, management and exploitation of all types of hotels and tourist units, housing complexes, sports facilities, etc. The initial share capital totals €3,300,000, specifically €2,200,000 for “Sea Front Bliss I” and €1,100,000 for “Sea Front Bliss II,” divided into shares with a nominal value of €100 each. The sole shareholder is the Cypriot company Nioval Ltd, whose sole shareholder is Giannis Mytilineos, who, as is well known, in addition to his other activities (shipping, etc.) also owns the emblematic Tatoi Club. The management of the two newly established companies includes Anastasia Mouchlidi as Chairwoman and CEO, Elisavet Paraskeopoulou, and Mytilineos’ two daughters, Amalia and Ioli, as members. They are the same individuals, in the same roles, who staff Tatoi Residences, the company founded last March. The book of Odysseas Athanasiou On November 25, the book “Why They Succeeded – 6 States from the Shadows to the Top,” written by Lamda Development CEO Odysseas Athanasiou, is expected to be released. The head of LAMDA, who has been at the helm of the group since the late 2000s, will speak at the launch event about his book, for which he offers an initial idea of its subject, stating that it is “a personal search regarding how small countries without natural resources or power managed to rise to the top. It is not a book about economics or politics. It is a book about how the right choices and faith in people can change a country’s future.” The presentation will take place on Tuesday, 2/12/25, at the National Gallery, and speaking about Athanasiou’s writing project will be the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Yiannis Stournaras, and EKPA professor Maria Efthymiou. A Thessalonian at the World Bank The information comes from reliable sources, although for now there is no official announcement. Antonis Kamaras, a scholar from Thessaloniki with a rich academic and professional background, will be Greece’s representative at the World Bank. It is a position held from 2013 to 2021 by Christos Papoutsis (former minister and European Commissioner under PASOK), and from early 2021 by a woman for the first time, economist Eleni Panagiotarea (daughter of journalist Anna Panagiotarea). For the past year, the position had remained vacant. Now it is being taken up by Antonis Kamaras, who studied at Connecticut College and the London School of Economics and has worked professionally as a consultant at the National Bank of Greece and the Municipality of Thessaloniki. He is a researcher at ELIAMEP and a founding member of the Greek Diaspora Project at SEESOX (Oxford). The…crazy regulation that favors high-speed ships over conventional ones A puzzle remains regarding how ferry routes are scheduled. Today two different rules apply: conventional ships must operate all year round, while high-speed vessels can operate for at least four months. However, the market picture has changed radically: 12 years ago there were just 13 high-speed vessels; today there are 34. This has two consequences:a) Huge fluctuations in prices. On routes with competition, ticket prices can fall to €0.60/mile, while as soon as competition disappears they rise to €3.25/mile.b) Conventional ships, which are obliged to operate in winter, are financially squeezed in summer by the high-speed vessels and struggle to make the year viable. The Competition Commission notes that if this asymmetry continues, there is a risk that winter routes will be reduced, something that would harm the cohesion of the islands. Silent Chinese wave at the Port of Piraeus The US and China may have temporarily buried the hatchet in their business-trade war, but each continues to keep a close eye on the other. The news that the Americans are planning a strategic investment to create an alternative commercial corridor to counter COSCO and the Port of Piraeus—by promoting Elefsina—did not go unnoticed in Beijing. At Greece’s main port, a plan has long been sitting in the drawers: the construction of a fourth pier, in the space between the car terminal and Pier I. This project is not part of COSCO’s mandatory commitments. Piraeus, due to the large volumes it handles, is running out of vital space, approaching its ceiling of 5.5 million TEUs. A fourth pier would give the Chinese operators the ability to increase container throughput by at least one million TEUs. However, without the authorities’ green light, the Chinese cannot move forward, so they are keeping a wait-and-see stance, monitoring developments. “There’s a certain silence,” people from the port told me. Greek shipping at full throttle Greek shipping groups continue to sweep both the shipyards and the secondhand market. On the newbuilding front, Thenamaris (Nikolas Martinou), StealthGas (Harry Vafias), Venergy (Byron Vasileiadis), and Akrotiri Tankers (Marielena Prokopiou & Konstantinos Lampsias) led the way with fresh tanker orders, investing in modern, scrubber-fitted vessels—an indication that the major players are looking long-term and betting on cleaner, more efficient shipping. Meanwhile, Costamare and Latsco remain active in containerships, strengthening their presence in East Asian shipyards. In the secondhand market, Greek activity was visible on both the buying and selling sides, especially in dry bulk. Aegean Bulk stood out by selling the Supramax Anemos (2011), while another Greek group acquired the Isolda D (Handysize, 2011). Overall, over the last twelve months Greek shipowners have signed 43 new tanker orders, 6 bulk carrier orders, and conducted 41 tanker acquisitions and 98 bulker purchases in the resale market. Greece thus comfortably maintains its global lead in S&P activity. Trek enters the Athens Exchange Alternative Market Today marks the start of trading for Trek Development on the ASE Alternative Market. The Papapolyzos family company is active in infrastructure project development and construction, with a focus on energy, environment, water management, and Smart City applications. After 30 years of operations, the company is moving to its next phase, planning an investment program of €4.6 million, financed by €1.9 million from the listing and €2.7 million from internal funds and projected profits for 2025–2027. About 30% of the plan concerns organic growth—primarily staffing and upgrading the operations of its Munich subsidiary—while 70% will go toward acquiring specialized companies in Greece and the EU. Four stocks looking for new highs The Titan share has been unstoppable for the past five sessions, rallying from €40 to nearly €44 and inching closer to its record of €45.8. The driver is the cement group’s four-year plan, involving investments up to €4 billion and EBITDA of €1 billion by 2029. Also on the table is the acquisition of the French company Vracs De L’Estuaire, with Titan in exclusive talks. Analysts reinforce the positive mood: Citi has set a target price of €56.1, S&P upgraded Titan’s rating to BB+, and Fitch raised its outlook to positive. Motor Oil exceeded €28 intraday over the last two sessions, closing just below that mark. With six consecutive gains, the stock would hit a new all-time high with an additional 2.2% rise. It’s a remarkable comeback for a share that had dropped below €20 seven months ago, with the interim dividend of €0.35 providing momentum. Viohalco remains in the spotlight, hitting a new high and approaching €10. Its subsidiary ElvalHalcor is following suit, extending its multi-year high and aiming to reach €3.5 for the first time since November 2007. A new era for EY Greece, in a historic Thessaloniki landmark The historic Matarasso–Altshech building—one of Thessaloniki’s most iconic Art Deco structures—will now house EY Greece’s administrative base in the city. Designed in the 1930s by architect Moshe Kazis, and once home to the Athens Stock Exchange’s local branch, the building has been transformed into a modern, flexible, and inclusive workspace while preserving its original identity. The renovation respected the building’s historic architecture, retaining signature elements of the era while adapting the space to the needs of a modern international consulting organization. The new facilities will host teams serving clients across sectors from finance to technology. On 22–23 November, the public will be able to take a look inside as part of EY’s Open House. A flood of money in the markets The terms are Money Supply M2 and M3, referring to the total money circulating in an economy at a given moment. Globally, this money stock reached $142 trillion in September 2025—an all-time record that reveals a fundamental shift in the world economy. The +9.1% increase in 2025 alone represents around $12 trillion. Over the past 25 years (since 2000), global money supply has grown at an average 7% CAGR, with only brief pauses during the 2008 crisis and the 2020 pandemic. After each crisis, the rebound was rapid and monetary expansion even stronger. Central banks face a dilemma: interest rate hikes since 2022 should have restricted liquidity, yet money supply continues to expand. The 2025 depreciation of the US dollar is the hidden key: as money loses value, investors are forced to shift into assets that protect against inflation. Capital seeks refuge from devaluation—and investing becomes not a choice, but a survival necessity for capital. Explore related questions

Title: Bitcoin: November 2025 turns historic – For all the wrong reasons

Analyzing why Bitcoin is at risk of the biggest ETF outflows ever. Bitcoin is facing its second-biggest ETF outflows since its launch, and could set a new record. It was unlikely that the price of Bitcoin could reverse the losses incurred in November if it ends in red. Bitcoin [BTC] slipped below the $100,000 mark and continued to trade below it as Bitcoin ETFs and quarterly returns followed the drain. In the meantime, the entire crypto market rose slightly by less than a percent while the Fear & Greed Index hit 17, dipping to extreme fear levels. Currently, the market seems to be heading towards its worst-ever month in terms of BTC ETF outflows and quarterly returns. As per data from SosoValue, Bitcoin ETFs were seeing the second-biggest outflow in 2025, which was at $2.33 billion while the month was still midway. Similar outflows through the remaining weeks would see November hit a new record. This year’s February had the biggest ETF outflows, which almost hit $4 billion. However, given that Bitcoin has now entered a discount zone after falling below $100K, the outflows could potentially reverse. Source: SosoValue The outflows have stemmed from the overall weakness seen in the market, with BTC’s price also facing a similar fate. Particularly, BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Fidelity led outflows in the past 24 hours, as per CoinGlass data. BlackRock saw more than 4.65K BTC in outflows, contributing to more than 94% of the total 4.94K BTC on the day. Bitcoin continued to struggle in terms of quarterly returns, as did Ethereum [ETH], which reflected a general market weakness. Since 2018, when BTC lost more than 42% in the last quarter, this year’s quarter has come the closest. However, this quarter’s loss still represents about a third of that of 2018. Other years were 2022 and 2019, which lost about 14.75% and 13.54%, respectively, as per CoinGlass data. Source: CoinGlass Ethereum was also seeing its worst returns since 2019. The returns were a reflection of the lost confidence among traders in the crypto sector. Historical data indicated that every red November was followed by a similar December, making it unlikely for BTC to reverse this sentiment. The pattern was evident in 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022, which were red in the last two months of the year. On the charts, BTC price slipped below a 15-month trendline support, as per Trader Tardigrade’s analysis on X (formerly Twitter). This further stressed the weakness of Bitcoin and its products, like ETFs. Reclaiming the support level would be very bullish for BTC, while the reverse would extend losses. The next area of interest on the downside is around $80K, while on the upside, it is sitting at $126K. Source: Trader Tardigrade Notably, only a change in crypto market sentiment would change the current downtrend in price action, returns, and BTC ETF flows. November was headed to be the biggest with outflows if the current trend stayed. However, given that prices had been declining for over a month and were at significant discounts, there was still potential for a rebound.

Title: Ireland reminded naysayers they haven’t gone away with dismantling of Australia
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/11/17/ireland-reminded-people-they-havent-gone-away-with-dismantling-of-australia/

Oh ye of little faith. For three weeks, on and off the record, coaches and players alike had been telling us they had a performance like this in the making. And on a squally Saturday night in a packed Aviva, so a record win over Australia came to pass. This was a well-timed reminder to themselves, the world of punditry and the supporters that Ireland remain a very good side. “That’s a given for me,” maintained Andy Farrell, who was critical of the previous two displays but never lost faith in his team’s ability. “We’re a very good side. There’s no doubt about that. You could put in all sorts of reasons of why the first performance or the second performance or whatever, but that’s never been in doubt, in my mind anyway.” Breaking free, in some respects from their own shackles, Ireland shot out of the blocks and then finished with a flourish, the replacements contributing to a true squad effort. They bookended the game with a Mack Hansen hat-trick in the first half-hour and another three tries in an expressive and clinical last 10 minutes. “Sometimes you prepare really well and it doesn’t transfer,” reflected Farrell. “We had an unbelievable warm-up out there today and I was going, ‘wow, if Carlsberg could do warm-ups, that would be it. But that doesn’t transfer either sometimes. I’ve seen unbelievably rubbish warm-ups and seen teams play well. So, it’s nice that we prepare well and we’ve got a performance on the back of it.” There was also the palpable ripple effects of the international football team’s memorable night last Thursday. “Yeah, it was class,” said Jack Conan of Ireland’s 2-0 win over Portugal – and this was before Sunday’s extraordinary events in Budapest. “A few of the lads went who weren’t involved and everyone’s kind of jealous that they went and a lot of us didn’t go, but it was on in the team room and we were loving it. “You looked at Thursday night and the atmosphere here and it was class. You know, Aaron Rowe singing Amhrán na bhFiann, which was brilliant and the lads would know him quite well. We were loving that and even just the performance and the doggedness of how the lads played on Thursday night was unreal,” added Conan. “We loved it and yeah, we talked about riding that wave of momentum.” The same can be said of the coming week and surfing an even bigger wave in the light of the Republic of Ireland’s dramatic 3-2 win in Budapest, as Farrell’s team prepare to welcome the all-conquering, multi-faceted South Africa. After their ominous 14-man win over France in Paris, Rassie Erasmus rested most of his frontliners for Saturday’s imperious 32-14 win over Italy in Turin, again achieved despite playing the majority of the game with 14 men. They arrive as the world’s number one side and back-to-back world champions. “Yeah, it’s great,” said Farrell of a perfectly scripted finale to the Autumn Nations Series and at an ideal kick-off time, 5.40pm, next Saturday. “It’s a fantastic place to be, isn’t it? The best in the world, everyone’s talking about them and the type of rugby that they’re playing. A rich vein of form and rightly so. They’ve played some brilliant stuff. “It’s a fantastic way to finish off our autumn. The last game at the Aviva. We’ll certainly enjoy this win, but the lads will be back on task and they’ll know what it means to everyone in Irish rugby as well, so we’ll look forward to that.” Yet again, all Farrell’s selection hunches were vindicated, not least Hansen at full-back. He completed only the second first-half hat-trick of tries by an Irish player in Test history. The first to do it was Eugene Davy in 1930, in a 14-11 win over Scotland at Murrayfield. [ ‘The worst team in Wallabies history’: Australian media show displeasure at Ireland defeatOpens in new window ] “Well, he gets rugby,” said Farrell of Hansen. “He can make a difference within the game. And also he’s got a good feel in the backfield. He understands the depth perception and all of that. He’s obviously very good in the air and in conditions like that, it’s always going to help any team. “He’s always been very good in the air. His skillset lends it to being that. He’s been brought up playing 10, 15 and wing. That’s why he’s such a nice player to watch.” It helped that the lineout delivered a perfect 10 and the Paddy McCarthy-infused scrum was potent, with Dan Sheehan and Caelan Doris delivering big games in a strong Irish pack. The confidence to stay positive, to keep trying things even after the inevitable mistakes on such a greasy surface and on such a wet and windy night, in many ways emanated from the calmness and inventiveness of Sam Prendergast. Here, in tandem with Jamison Gibson-Park, who seems somehow to be playing at 100 miles an hour while in cruise control, Prendergast was the orchestrator in chief of the Irish game. As well as his easy-on-the-eye control and array of passes, he and Gibson-Park terrorised the Wallabies back three, and particularly Max Jorgensen, with their aerial bombardment and variety of kicks. The reconfigured backrow, with Doris at seven for the first 50 minutes, perhaps had one eye on the Springboks. The same may also be said for playing Gibson-Park at fullback for the last 10 minutes in considering a 6-2 bench split. Gibson-Park applied the coup de grace with a cross-kick for Robbie Henshaw to score Ireland’s sixth try with the last play. “He’s going to start at seven next week,” quipped Farrell. “He was playing touch rugby and just enjoying himself. He’s just enjoying himself. He’s tough, strong as well. What a player.” While the unlucky Stuart McCloskey suffered a recurrence of the groin issues which forced him off in Chicago, Farrell expects to have Josh van der Flier and Garry Ringrose back in the mix. In a positive way, he has a number of selection considerations. Scoring sequence – 6 mins: Hansen try, S Prendergast con 7-0; 11: Hansen try, S Prendergast con 14-0; 18: Ikitau try, O’Connor con 14-7; 28: Hansen try 19-14; 40: McReight try, O’Connor con 19-14; Half-time 19-14; 57: Prendergast dg 22-14; 63: Crowley pen 25-14; 70: Doris try, Crowley con 32-14; 74: Pollard try 32-19; 78: Baird try, Crowley con 39-19; 81: Henshaw try, Crowley con 46-19 IRELAND: M Hansen; T O’Brien, R Henshaw, S McCloskey, J Lowe; S Prendergast, J Gibson-Park; P McCarthy, D Sheehan, T Furlong, J Ryan, T Beirne, R Baird, C Doris (capt), J Conan.

Title: Scrum-ptious style: three Leinster rugby players show their flair for fashion

We know how they look – and perform – on the pitch. But how do they tackle looking glamorous off the pitch? Here, three Leinster rugby players – Eimear Corri Fallon, Vicky Elmes Kinlan and Hannah Wilson – show their flair dressing up and share their style secrets. Vicky Elmes Kinlan, from Rathnew, Co Wicklow, started playing rugby at the age of 12, encouraged by her father, Mick. She now represents Wicklow RFC at club level, and has played for Ireland on both the Sevens and 15s teams. “I am very basic when it comes to style and know what suits my body type, so I stick to what I know. I am more muscly on my upper half and dress to suit that,” she says. “I love pants, long skirts worn with smaller tops. I buy online while also checking out the sales. “I tend to prefer neutral colours and don’t like pattern. I would never have tried on this dress, but it pushed me out of my comfort zone, and I now like it. I usually wear something more fitted, but I like its flowy silhouette. I never really wear dresses, even to dinner dances, where most girls wear floor length, though I did wear a blue one to my debs. “I love gold jewellery. I like the way people express themselves in how they dress.” White ruffle dress, Rixo, €373; metallic shoes, Dune, €80; earrings, Astrid & Miyu, €115 Wilson, a promising young backline talent for Leinster Women’s Rugby, started playing at the age of five in Kildare. She plays club rugby with Old Belvedere and earned selection for the Ireland U-20 women’s squad in 2024. “I have never worn a skirt until now, as I just don’t feel comfortable in them – I tend to wear jeans, dressy trousers and a jumper with trainers. I buy a lot from All Saints, but I also have a black two-piece from Reiss. I don’t like showing my bruised legs all the way up when I don’t have to wear training outfits. “I’m not a big shopper, but I like to buy when there is a purpose. I have a big build, so I have to try everything on before I buy. I stick to neutrals – black, beige, grey with a bit of denim. “I get my hair colour done every four months. I feel more pressure of people watching me on rather than off the pitch, and always have my tan when I know there will be pictures because I am so pale. I also wear braids – six! – in my hair. It’s sore getting them, but they are better than a ponytail that gets messed up in a scrum. “I love silver jewellery and used to wear seven rings on my fingers along with bracelets – I have one Cartier ring, which I got for my 18th, and a Tiffany silver ring I got for my 21st. “What I love about rugby is the feeling of success and having a purpose to get up in the morning. And of course, the friendship.” Coat, Maje, €386; linen waistcoat, Rixo, €80; linen midi skirt, Rixo, €230; gold heeled sandals, €248 From Laois and a former player with Portlaoise RFC, Eimear Corri Fallon announced her retirement from international rugby earlier this month to focus on her career as a doctor (she studied sports science at Dublin City University and medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland), but will still represent Leinster Rugby Women and Blackrock College RFC at club level. “I started playing at 23. Athletics was my background. Medicine came into my head when I was studying sports science, and the health module made me realise my interest in the human body and physiology. “I’ve loved fashion since I was a child, and I’m a shopaholic. Scrubs and rugby kit are not so glamorous, but you don’t have a choice. I like to express myself through clothes, and I love bright colours so there are no pastels in my wardrobe but big blues or pinks. My style is casual – city-wear jeans and a lot of blazers, but when I am going out, I go all out with make-up hair, sequins and satin skirts. I love skorts because I am quite tall, which I wear with long or knee-length boots – they are a game changer. I would never wear pastels nor midi dresses, and cargo pants don’t suit me. “I’d describe my style as bright, fun and elegant chic. I buy in Kildare Village, Sandra, Maje and Self Portrait, and I love buying make-up as well. I work in Naas hospital as a doctor in A&E five days a week and on call at weekends, so it’s a bright pair of royal blue scrubs. “I would not usually go for a full co-ordinating suit like this one – it’s such a statement piece – but would wear one piece with something else. So my style is primarily casual. Footwear tends to be low block heels.” Cropped jacket, Maje, €295; trousers, Maje, €195; heels, Dune, €85 All clothes and accessories from Kildare Village, a partner of Leinster Rugby, shot on location in Drew Studios in Dublin.

Title: Google union organizer on AI job impact, working conditions
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/podcast/Google-union-organizer-on-AI-job-impact-working-conditions
Time Published: 2025-11-17T05:00:00Z

AI advocates typically respond to concerns about job loss with reassurances that AI will ultimately create more jobs. They also assert that if AI displaces jobs, organizations will upskill workers for new, more valuable jobs or train them enough on AI to remain employable in the AI-driven workplace of the future. That case faced setbacks in the past two months as evidence mounted that AI is already destroying jobs. Amazon announced it was laying off 14,000 corporate workers so it can be more nimble. The cuts weren't portrayed as directly resulting from AI, but in June, CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon's workforce would shrink as the company embraces AI. Target and UPS announced similar layoffs. But the reductions most explicitly caused by AI were at software vendors, including Salesforce, which said in September it would cut 4,000 customer support jobs. Earlier in the year, CEO Marc Benioff said AI was already doing nearly half the work in the department. The loudest voices on AI's impact on jobs tend to be executives at vendors that make AI software or their biggest customers. Skeptics are harder to find. In this episode of Enterprise Apps Unpacked, Shannon Wait, a senior organizer at the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU), discusses the issue from the tech worker's point of view. Her job has mostly involved advocating for the rights of the workers who labor behind the scenes to make AI possible, which she details in the podcast. She also explains how those same workers are increasingly worried about losing their jobs to automation through AI. "When people think about AI, they think innovation and curing cancer," Wait said. "We're going to move America into a new age and try to beat China in this race. Those are the talking points, when in reality the talking points should be the layoffs and job losses. We're streamlining shopping through ChatGPT instead of curing cancer." Wait made international news in 2021 when the AWU, part of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), filed an unfair labor practices action on her behalf against Alphabet, Google's parent company, and Modis, the contractor that had employed her since 2019 at a Google data center in South Carolina. Wait noticed the pay and advancement opportunities of contractors weren't comparable to those of Google employees at the same facility. Nor were the working conditions. The contract workers' jobs involved difficult physical labor, such as swapping out server hard drives and heavy batteries in hot data centers that could hit 85 degrees. After a series of unmet promises, minimal responses to complaints about unfit conditions and other disappointments from her employer, Wait accidentally broke her company-issued water bottle and was refused a replacement. It was the last straw. She complained and was escorted out of the building. So she immediately invited coworkers to join the AWU but was suspended with pay. The union action succeeded, Google and Modis settled, and Wait was back at work within two weeks. Her victory garnered widespread press coverage. The BBC posted an article on its website titled "The woman who took on Google and won." Google, which the workers had accused of discouraging unionization, signed a document saying employees had the right to discuss pay and working conditions. Since then, Wait has been a full-time advocate for the union. Much of her work has focused on the plight of raters, whose job is to evaluate the quality as well as the accuracy of webpages and search results to help improve Google's algorithms and AI. In a recent survey, some raters said they know they're training new AI that is meant to replace them. Some have been subjected to automatic suspension by "robo-bosses" for not meeting certain quotas and must go through a long process with a human to get reinstated. "You would think that these companies would want the people working on AI to have feedback on how to do better and be given clear metrics on how to make these tools safer and easier to use," Wait said. "Instead, you're just an outlier -- you're suspended -- hope you get re-onboarded at some point in the future. I just don't think that's a good way to do business in any part of the world." Wait volunteers as policy advisor for the TechEquity collaborative, which partnered this year with the AWU-CWA to publish a report titled "Ghost workers in the AI machine: U.S. data workers speak out about big tech's exploitation," which surveyed raters and other workers in behind-the-scenes roles at AI providers. Other topics discussed in the podcast include the following: David Essex is an industry editor who covers enterprise applications, emerging technology and market trends, and creates in-depth content for several TechTarget websites.

CEA Anantha Nageswaran: India’s equity markets have grown impressively, but initial public offerings have increasingly become exit vehicles for early investors rather than mechanisms for raising long-term capital.

Loyal Equipments stock traded flat on the BSE at Rs 207.65 Natural Gas Futures may correct to ₹370; consider buying on dips for potential gains up to ₹445. Last week’s larger market sell-off, which was triggered by hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials that dampened expectations for a December interest rate cut, caused gold prices to drop 2.5% and silver prices to drop 5.5%. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is citing the shutdown blackout as justification for maintaining unchanged interest rates in December. Naturally, this is in line with the proverb, “Do nothing when you do not know what to do.” Since the beginning of last week, the US dollar’s weakness and rumours that the Fed would resume asset purchases have served as catalysts for gold’s rise, but Thursday and Friday made it abundantly evident that this is no longer the case. Additionally, gold and silver faced pressure from position closing to meet margin calls brought on by declines in equity markets, which fell on Friday after the global selloff sparked by hawkish Fed signals. Market expectations for a 25 basis-point rate cut next month dropped to 42% from 64% earlier this week, down from more than 95% a month ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. The longest U.S. government shutdown ended Thursday, creating a major data gap that left the Fed and traders flying blind ahead of next month’s policy meeting. The U.S. government shutdown lasted 43 days, the longest in history, but the effects will likely be felt for the next few weeks. Some economic data, such as October’s CPI numbers, will be lost forever because that information is collected manually. For economists, this could be a significant issue because economic modelling depends on reliable, consistent data. In the end, inflation is not high enough to stop the Fed — especially as it continues to face pressure from President Donald Trump — from cutting interest rates, and even if the central bank skips the December meeting, rates will be lower in 2026. While there are clear signs that the U.S. labour market is losing significant momentum, even without October’s economic data, inflation is also not accelerating. One Federal Reserve meeting will not affect gold’s long-term fundamental support. There is uncertainty regarding the U.S. economy, tariffs, and the next interest rate move, so any pullback is likely to be short and shallow as the main drivers of gold remain in place.If gold prices sustain above $4150, we are likely to see the uptrend continuing; if prices sustain below $4050, we can see a correction towards the previous low to around $3900. This week’s failed attempt to break above $4200 per ounce has created some short-term bearish sentiment.After reaching crucial resistance over $54, the market is experiencing fresh selling pressure, and silver has started a wild rollercoaster ride. Silver has recovered all of its losses from last month’s severe selloff, which saw prices plummet 16% in only two weeks, over the past seven sessions. Despite the important double top that silver’s price action has formed, market sentiment is still largely bullish. For me to go firmly negative, silver must at least break and close below $50. The neckline must break around $47 for a double top to be confirmed, setting a target of $44. However, a run-up towards $56 may occur if prices defy gravity and surpass $53.50.

Indian rupee faces pressure from weaker Asian currencies but is supported by the central bank, opening flat against the US dollar. Indian government bonds are expected to start the week on a muted note on Monday, with focus remaining on the central bank’s strategy to manage demand-supply dynamics after it resumed bond buying for the first time in six weeks, earlier this month. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note may drift between 6.51% and 6.55%, a trader at a private bank said, after ending at 6.5265% on Friday. Bond yields move inversely to prices. (Reuters) Exceeding most exit poll predictions, the NDA stormed back to power in the Bihar assembly election with a commanding mandate of 202 seats, far higher than 122 it won in the previous election. The recently launched women-centric cash transfer scheme played a major role in improving the voter turnout – especially among women, which reflected in the results as well. The Nitish Kumar-led JDU was a clear winner, snatching 40+ seats from the RJD, while the BJP (the single-largest party in terms of seats won) gained at the cost of the Congress (-13 seats). Although the results of the Bihar election send a clear signal of the political appeal of the BJP and its allies, we believe the JDU with 85 seats is currently in a commanding position at the Centre. Sunday, 16 November 2025: India’s leading petrochemical and fertiliser company Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation (SPIC) announced the appointment of Ms. Sweta Suman, IAS, as a Nominee Director representing Tamilnadu Industrial Development Corporation Limited (TIDCO) on its board. The company, in a regulatory filing, said the appointment is effective from November 13, 2025. Mrs. Sweta Suman, a 2020 batch IAS officer, currently serves as the Executive Director of TIDCO and holds full additional charge as CEO of Chennai Metro Asset Management Limited (CMAML). In a separate filing, the fertiliser maker reported a 74 per cent rise in consolidated net profit to ₹61.22 crore for the September quarter, driven by strong operational performance. The company had posted a net profit of ₹35.17 crore in the year-ago period. Total income during the July-September period increased to ₹842.82 crore from ₹761.22 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, a growth of 11 per cent. Revenue from operations grew nearly 8 per cent to ₹817.29 crore. On a standalone basis, the company reported a 71 per cent increase in net profit at ₹53.1 crore for the quarter, compared with ₹31.01 crore in the year-ago period. “The buoyant quarterly results reflect the company’s continued commitment to serving the Indian farmer community while maintaining operational efficiency. The increase in turnover and significant improvement in profitability compared to the corresponding quarter last year demonstrate disciplined execution and a focus on profitable growth, “ SPIC Chairman Ashwin Muthiah said. Asian markets were mixed, after Japan’s economy contracted for the first time in six quarters due to the US tariff hit. Fading expectations of a US rate cut in December following hawkish comments from key Federal Reserve policymakers also weighed on sentiment. With the domestic earnings season coming to an end, the market moves back to positive updates related to the India-US tariff resolution to rise to record high levels, said two analysts. (Reuters) India’s equity benchmarks are poised to open higher on Monday, with the outlook remaining positive on improving earnings, while fading hopes of an imminent U.S. interest rate cut weighed on global sentiment. The Gift Nifty futures were trading at 26,008 points, as of 7:40 a.m. IST, indicating that the Nifty 50 could open above Friday’s close of 25,910.05. Both Nifty and Sensex rose about 1.6% last week, as improving corporate earnings and a key state election result aided the buying interest. The gains were led by IT and pharmaceutical stocks, as the U.S. government’s reopening lifted hopes for economic clarity. “Sentiment remains strong for the Nifty 50 with the potential to move towards 26,200/26,350 levels in the short term,” said Rupak De, a senior technical analyst at LKP Securities. The Nifty 50 is currently trading 1.4% below the all-time high level of 26,277.37, touched in September 2024. (Reuters) Domestic markets are likely to open on a positive note on Monday, after an emphatic win by the NDA-led government in Bihar assembly elections turned the domestic sentiment positive. Gift Nifty at 26,020 indicates a gap-up opening of about 75-80 points for Nifty. However, global markets are sending a cautious signal. Nifty expected to open 80 points higher, reflecting positive domestic sentiment amid cautious global market conditions.

Despite a softer revenue in H1CFY, the company has strengthened its profitability and sharpened its operating model post-IPO, setting up a more stable base for long-term growth. A key pillar of this strategy is retail expansion. The company plans to scale its footprint from 73 stores to around 120 over the next 24–36 months, supported by better real estate deals and measured store rollout.

Title: Bitcoin fear hits 2025 lows – Yet institutions scoop up $24B: What gives?

The sell-off may be the tail-end of a six-month stealth bear phase. Because the Fear & Greed Index has dropped to 10, its lowest reading of 2025. ETFs added $24 billion this year, even as retail panic triggered $19B in liquidations. Bitcoin [BTC] sentiment has dropped to its lowest level of 2025, but the market isn’t breaking the way many fear. Retail traders are panicking, yet long-term signs remain steady while institutions continue to buy through ETFs. Experts are now saying this sell-off could be the final stretch of a six-month quiet bear phase. Will the market recover? Recent data from Alphractal showed the Crypto Fear & Greed Index falling to 10 at press time. This is the lowest sentiment reading of 2025. Source: Alphractal Such extreme fear has appeared only during market resets or the tail end of prolonged drawdowns. The index has now fallen from the mid-60s to near-zero territory within weeks, similar to the unwinding seen during mid-2021 and mid-2022. Source: Alphractal On top of that, the broader Alpha Crypto Sentiment Gauge shifted from neutral-bullish earlier this quarter to bearish and very bearish signals. That shift kept traders focused on possible capitulation zones. Over $19 billion in liquidations and 1.6 million wiped-out traders created the perfect setup for large players to absorb supply at lower prices. Long-term holders reportedly released 62,000 BTC since October, much of it flowing into ETFs managed by firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. Despite panic-driven selling, ETF balances have grown by $24 billion in 2025. This correction may be a structural transfer rather than a cycle top. Building on the narrative, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley noted in an X post that crypto may already be deep into a six-month bear phase. He argued that the traditional four-year cycle model no longer applied to a market shaped by ETF flows, regulation, and heavyweight institutions. Source: X By contrast, post-ETF dynamics introduced new mechanical buy-and-sell patterns that influenced volatility. Despite the recent drop, Horsley maintained that underlying conditions could support one of the strongest recovery environments yet.

Title: AIL wrap: Terenure coach hails ‘courage and guts’ as derby win nudges them closer to top

Carlos Spencer hailed the character of his team after Terenure moved to within a point of Energia All-Ireland League leaders St Mary’s with a gritty 14-12 win to end their neighbours’ unbeaten record. On a sodden Lakelands Park pitch, which nonetheless held up well, this full-on D6W derby captivated a crowd of about 4,000 from its first minute to a thunderous climax. The prolific Mick O’Gara opened the scoring before Terenure struck through John McKee’s close-range finish after a sweeping move released Caolan Dooley to link with the supporting Griffin Culver. O’Gara then landed three more penalties to inch St Mary’s 12-7 in front before they withheld a siege on the line inside the last 10 minutes. However, Terenure’s furious kick-chase and counter-ruck earned another onslaught from which flanker Oisín McCormack burrowed over and Chris Cosgrave landed another fine conversion. Cue a wave of attacks from distance by St Mary’s, with Conor Dean puling the strings, which led to a 52-metre penalty by O‘Gara with the last kick which had the legs but drifted wide. “It’s a shame that the weather didn’t play its part and give us a nice day. We could probably have played a bit more rugby,” said Spencer. “So, we had to tidy things up a bit and sometimes it became a bit of a scrap. “We missed out on a couple of opportunities and our discipline let us down, but we stayed in the fight and grafted to show true character. I’m very proud of that and when we got our opportunity we took it. We didn’t give in, which was good.” His counterpart, Mark McHugh, expressed similar sentiments. “A typical derby, no quarter given and none asked. We could have nicked it at the end, justly or unjustly I don’t know, but they are a really good team. “They’re going to be there or thereabouts at the end and I really hope we will be as well. Disappointed to lose, but equally delighted with the fight we showed and the courage and the guts, because they are attributes you can’t coach.” Champions Clontarf moved alongside Terenure on 23 points by beating Cork Con 17-3 at Temple Hill in a repeat of last year’s final. Lansdowne are fourth on 20 points after a 36-11 win over neighbours Old Belvedere at Ollie Campbell Park. Max Deegan stole line-outs and imposed himself, as did Charlie Tector. Ballynahinch are fifth, a point further back, after their 24-3 bonus-point win at Nenagh Ormond, while UCD moved out of the bottom two after a handsome bonus-point win over Young Munster. Curiously, the top two entering round six met in each of the top four divisions. Old Wesley remain first in 1B after a 30-16 win at home to Trinity, as do unbeaten Barnhall in 2A after a 28-10 win at Dungannon. The same goes for unbeaten Galwegians after their seven-try 43-21 win away to UL Bohemians. The same match-up took place in the women’s division on the UL 4G, where champions UL Bohs moved above a dogged Galwegians with a 36-24 win.

Title: Firm friends: Finola Kennedy on a remarkable friendship between the founder of the Legion of Mary and former president WT Cosgrave

Time Published: 2025-11-16T19:00:00Z
Full Content:
A remarkable friendship existed between Frank Duff, the founder of the Legion of Mary, and WT Cosgrave who died 60 years ago on November 16th, 1965. Many tributes followed Cosgrave’s death, including an impressive one from then taoiseach Seán Lemass. Understandably the tributes focused on his public life. But there were other, less well known strands. Among these was Cosgrave’s support for the lay Catholic organisation founded by Duff in 1921, and which today numbers four million active members worldwide. Following school in Blackrock College, Duff entered the Civil Service in the Land Commission where he made a significant contribution to the 1923 Land Act before transferring to the Department of Finance. He identified closely with the Civil Service ethos. In a letter written to Seán Ó Faoláin in August 1944, Duff would write, “My cast of mind is mechanical rather than literary. I was a civil servant.” On Saturday July 15th, 1922, in the middle of the Civil War when ministers and officials were living in Government Buildings in Upper Merrion Street, Duff, accompanied by Father Michael Creedon, a priest in Francis Street parish, obtained an interview with WT Cosgrave, then minister for local government and soon to be president. EP McCarron, secretary of the department of local government, was also present and probably facilitated the meeting. Duff and Fr Creedon were seeking accommodation for homeless women whose alternative was prostitution. The Monto area of Dublin, named after Montgomery Street, since named Foley Street, was such a thriving centre for prostitution and for late-night drinking in shebeens that it merited a mention in the Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1903. Cosgrave recalled how “Frank and Fr Creedon came to the ante-chamber of the cabinet room while a meeting was in progress – asking to see me. It was then he told me of efforts of Fr Creedon and himself on behalf of these friendless girls”. Cosgrave listened intently and asked them to come back in the morning for his response. On the following morning, Sunday, Duff and Creedon called to Government Buildings where they were given a letter. The letter, in Cosgrave’s handwriting, informed them that premises at 76 Harcourt Street had been placed at their disposal free of rent and taxes. A previous owner of the house was the builder, Batt O’Connor, a close friend of Michael Collins. You have won the deep respect of all and you have made Ireland respected everywhere. Personally I could not possibly express the extent of my regard for you and for your work In 1926 at a time of great poverty and dire housing conditions in Dublin, Mr Cosgrave’s government made available to Duff the premises of the North Dublin Union for use as a hostel for homeless men. The Morning Star, as the hostel was named, was officially opened in the presence of a small number of guests, including president Cosgrave, on March 25th, 1927. In October 1930, the Regina Coeli, a hostel for homeless women and their children, opened beside the Morning Star. Both hostels, which have remained open without interruption since 1927 and 1930 respectively, are served by voluntary workers who are members of the Legion of Mary. In 1930 when Duff had still failed to obtain a meeting with the Archbishop of Dublin, Archbishop Byrne, regarding recognition for the legion, Duff again approached Cosgrave. On this occasion Cosgrave, recognising difficulties with the archdiocese, arranged a meeting with the papal nuncio, Paschal Robinson, who had arrived in Ireland on January 14th, 1930. A handwritten letter – undated, but clearly written shortly after Robinson arrived in Ireland – from Paul Banim, the president’s secretary, to Duff, said: “You are to be in room 58 Shelbourne Hotel at 5 o’clock sharp. The President has made the appointment you sought. Ring me.” At the time the Nunciature in the Phoenix Park was undergoing renovations and Robinson was staying in the Shelbourne. In the year following the Shelbourne meeting, Cosgrave accompanied Duff to the Nunciature on May 7th, 1931, when a proposed Roman trip was discussed. Two weeks later on May 23rd, Duff, accompanied by Monsignor O’Brien from Liverpool, travelled to Rome. In Rome Duff was received in audience by Pope Pius XI, who said that he wished the legion would spread over the world. Thanks to Cosgrave, Duff was received by the pope many years before he was received by his own archbishop in Dublin. [ Flying columnist – Frank McNally on a lightning visit to LeesideOpens in new window ] Duff never forgot his debt to Cosgrave. When Cosgrave’s government was replaced in 1932, he wrote to Cosgrave, “You have won the deep respect of all and you have made Ireland respected everywhere. Personally I could not possibly express the extent of my regard for you and for your work.” According to his son Liam Cosgrave, “The last letter that WT wrote was to Frank Duff the actual day he got his final attack 15th November 1965. He died on 16th.” At the time Duff was in Rome for the Vatican Council. A Requiem Mass was held in Rome, at which the government was represented by then minister for agriculture and fisheries, Charles Haughey. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Posted on 11/16/2025 10:29:36 AM PST by Mariner Billionaire Peter Thiel’s latest 13F didn’t show off a mere trim, but a full-blown exit from AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA).It comes at a surprising point when Wall Street’s been busy declaring the chipmaker as virtually untouchable.Although Nvidia recently surpassed a $5 trillion valuation, Thiel walked away completely, shrinking his fund’s equity book by roughly two-thirds while building it around three megacap names.That’s far from being a rebalance and more of an emphatic statement.Thiel had previously warned about AI’s hype cycle running far ahead of its real economics, and his Q3 portfolio shakeup aligns with that view.

Title: Paddy McCarthy delighted after vindicating Farrell’s decision to select him against Australia

A first Test in Chicago against the All Blacks, a first Test try a week later against Japan and a first Test start against Australia. Paddy McCarthy has arrived as an Irish international and how. On Saturday night he utterly vindicated the faith placed in him by Andy Farrell and the Irish coaches with a 47-minute showing which all his coaches and team-mates through the ranks had long since envisaged. First and foremost McCarthy – immovable while staying square – had the upper hand on his side of the scrum against Allan Alaalatoa, which was the platform for two of Ireland’s first three tries. He put in a shift defensively with nine tackles, while giving a glimpse of his bull-like carries. “Yeah I was happy,” he said afterwards. “Scrum was good. There were mistakes there that I need to brush up on, but happy enough as it’s international rugby and it’s not going to go perfectly. Happy with how I’m going and thankfully I’m not injured or anything, that’s always good.” Yet again, another Farrell fast-tracking hunch is working out. As with older brother Joe, whom the coach blooded at the age of 21 in the November clash with Australia three years ago, the Ireland coach recognises their raw power. “My brother was telling me there’s very few times where you get a packed-out Aviva, there’s not many moments that it comes around. Even if you have a long career, it’s still very special every time you’re playing in the Aviva.” Talking about his brother’s influence, the young McCarthy said: “He’s massive. Equally, when I’m out and he’s in, I’ll help him in any way I can. We’re great friends, he’s my best friend. It’s nice. “I can’t believe I was playing Australia today. I went over to Australia and I remember watching the first Test and having a pint, just like in a Lions jersey, watching it. I can’t believe playing a guy like James O’Connor, all those guys. There’s some great players in the Australian team so it’s kind of surreal, to be honest. It was cool.” Not out of character, it has to be said, there was also one daft penalty for needless use of a hand on the deck in a ruck under the nose of referee Karl Dickson. Oh Paddy. But it’s the McCarthy edge which Farrell also likes, citing how he left an indelible impression on him when he was part of the under-20s squad which the team trained against three seasons ago and seemingly caused all sorts of carnage. “Some of it’s probably true, some of it’s not that true,” he said with a sheepish grin. “I don’t know. It was funny. I was probably a bit of an idiot in the Under 20s anyway. I was really revved up. I probably toned things down a little bit as I got into the senior environment, just chilled out in a good way. Obviously, still adding to the game, but just focusing on my role a bit more. “It was cool training against the senior squad. It was kind of funny. Obviously, I idolised Johnny [Sexton]. I thought I was being friendly, but I think he took it as me being cheeky or something. He kind of fecked me out a bit, but he was grand. It was cool,” said McCarthy. For all the hope through his Blackrock, Trinity and Irish Under-20s days, McCarthy still hadn’t made a start for Leinster until this season and despite being in the squad, missed out on a first cap against either Georgia or Portugal. He didn’t envisage this. “I wasn’t sure if I’d be playing for Ireland or not. I know when the squad came out, I thought I was in the A squad. When the message came in, it was ‘ANS squad’. I didn’t know it was ‘Autumn Nations’, I thought it was A squad or A national squad,” he revealed. “I was like, I’ll just take what I get and play as much as possible. But I was happy out. I was very happy that the coaches, Fogs, Pauly and Faz, put a lot of confidence in me when I came in; more than I expected. “I didn’t think I would get a start in this window because in the summer, I didn’t even play in the Ireland squad. So, to actually get a start and being told I was going well, in the scrums and things like that, it was nice.” A fourth cap against the Springboks would top off a slightly surreal month, but he remains humble. “Yeah, I’d love that. There is good competition and unfortunately Jack Boyle hasn’t got a run out yet and we’re still young and both learning. I’ll take what I can get and if I get to play again, I’d love it. If not, whatever, I’ll do it with the squad.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: Australia net zero target: Energy companies warn sidelining renewables will raise power bills

Australia’s biggest energy companies have reinforced their support for the government’s 2050 net zero target and warned that failing to embrace renewables will only send power bills higher, contradicting a key Coalition argument as it fights to wind back climate action. Liberal leader Sussan Ley, who formally ditched the Coalition’s support for net zero on Sunday, has revived claims that renewable energy and emissions targets will impose unaffordable costs on households. Most of Australia’s remaining coal-fired power plants are due to close within the next 10 years as they face frequent equipment faults, soaring maintenance costs and intense competition from renewables.Credit: Paul Jones If elected, the Coalition would also dismantle Labor’s interim climate targets, abolish electric vehicle incentives and extend taxpayer funds to keep coal-fired power stations running longer or support the construction of new ones, she said. But in a report to be released on Monday, the chief executives of more than a dozen major electricity suppliers, including AGL, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia, who are all members of the Australian Energy Council, rejected calls to ditch net zero and insisted that shifting to a mostly renewable grid was the best way to keep bills as low as possible. The chief executives emphasised the need for “policy certainty and stability” as Australia neared a critical juncture in the energy transition. While coal-fired power stations still supply more than half of the nation’s electricity needs, most of them are approaching the end of their usable lives and are due to be retired before 2035, meaning they must be urgently replaced regardless of net zero ambitions, they said. ‘In the long run, this approach [renewables] will still be cheaper than continuing to invest in existing or new coal-fired power generation.’ In 2022, AGL brought forward the closure of its Bayswater coal plant in NSW to no later than 2033, while the retirement of the Loy Yang A generator in Victoria was fast-tracked by up to 10 years to 2035. Origin Energy originally intended to retire Eraring, the nation’s largest coal plant, in 2032, but now plans to shut it in 2027. The anti-net zero bloc: Jessica Collins, Angus Taylor, Sarah Henderson, Andrew Hastie and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price arrive with other Liberals for their party room showdown on Wednesday.Credit: Alex Ellinghausen The industry argues the cheapest path for consumers is to invest in replacing ageing coal generators with firmed-up renewable energy, rather than forcing the extensions of ageing and increasingly unreliable plants, which can break down with no notice and cause huge price rises, or building new coal-fired facilities. “The least-cost, lowest-impact pathway is an energy system dominated by renewables and firmed by battery storage, gas and pumped hydro,” the chief executives said. However, the Australian Energy Council stresses that replacing ageing power stations is “not costless”, and will push up people’s electricity bills – at least for a while. Building more wind and solar farms, large-scale storage projects and thousands of kilometres of extra pylons and power lines to stitch together a bigger and more complex grid will all add to costs that need to be passed on to consumers, it said. The report noted that electricity prices had “never been under more pressure” due to heavy investments needed to replace and decarbonise ageing generation assets. It called for a more open and honest dialogue about what the energy transition would cost homes and businesses. “I think it’s the calm before the storm,” one chief executive said. In particular, network costs to maintain and upgrade transmission infrastructure, which account for about a third of a customer’s bill, are expected to increase significantly in the coming years. The CSIRO calculates that a new coal-fired power plant, using modern technology to keep emissions down as much as possible, would produce electricity for between $111 and $178 a megawatt hour – at a midpoint of $145. Power from renewables in a mostly renewable grid, meanwhile, would cost between $116 and $165 a megawatt hour (a midpoint of $141), which also factors in the billions of dollars in additional costs such as paying for batteries, gas and transmission lines. Once built and operating, renewables were among the lowest-cost sources of energy, Australian Energy Council chief executive Louisa Kinnear said. “But we still need to account for the costs of constructing new supply and adopting our existing system to accommodate and firm up low emissions, intermittent sources,” she said. “In the long run, this approach will still be cheaper than continuing to invest in existing or new coal-fired power generation, but we need to ensure the transition is managed carefully.” The push to scrap the commitment to net zero by 2050 and weaken interim climate targets would breach the conditions of the Paris Agreement, which Australia signed up to in 2016. Large investors, who have been pouring billions of dollars into green energy projects across Australia, described the Coalition’s backdown as “material and disappointing”. “However, the fundamentals remain,” said Clean Energy Investor Group chief executive Richie Merzian, who represents funds including US-based BlackRock, France’s Neoen and Australia’s Macquarie Bank. “New generation is required, clean energy is the best path for returns, and the current government is committed to supporting that.” Debby Blakey, chief executive of the $100 billion superannuation giant HESTA, which invests heavily in the energy transition, said bipartisan support for climate targets including net zero was important for investors to know that policies would remain stable. “This is critical given investors commit capital over very long time frames for investments like energy infrastructure,” she said. “Attracting global private capital to invest in Australia’s transition is underpinned by long-term policy certainty.” The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Title: Sublease crisis winding down in latest sign of NYC office recovery

The wind’s gone out of the great sublease balloon that supposedly spelled doom for the city’s office market. Manhattan office sublease availability has fallen to less than in 2019, according to Transwestern — down to just 11.8 million square feet in the third quarter, compared to 12.3 million before the start of the pandemic and a high of 23 million in early 2023. But wait — wasn’t the sublease “glut” going to wreck the progress that was made since COVID-19 ravaged the economy? CoStar News in April 2023 cited a Savills warning that, “Companies putting spaces up for sublease reached an all-time high of 22.4 million square feet in the first quarter,” or 24.6% of all Manhattan office availability at the time. An even gloomier essay posted on The City in May 2023 described Big Apple office market “deterioration” due to “scores” of empty buildings, high interest rates, $16 billion in outstanding debt, sublease volume, and the usual bogeyman of work-from-home. Now, however, Transwestern reports that sublease offerings have fallen to 18% of Manhattan availability. Most spaces still up for grabs were smaller than 25,000 square feet, although a few large blocks remained. “We’ve been keeping an eye on the sublease levels for a few years now, first as they ballooned during the height of the pandemic, and with optimistic expectation as they slowly subsided over the past few quarters,” said Transwestern research manager Corrie Slewett. “It’s a notable milestone that Manhattan’s available sublet space has settled below the pre-pandemic levels,” Slewett added. Recent, large sublease deflations included Paramount Global, which last month yanked 92,5000 square feet from availability at 1515 Broadway. Large absorption deals included Blackrock’s 193,000 square feet from Meta at 50 Hudson Yards; Robinhood’s 125,400 square-foot sublease from MSG at 2 Penn; and Sixth Street Partners’ 103,400 square feet from Pfizer at The Spiral. CBRE global brokerage head Stephen B. Siegel commented, “The market is on fire and the absorption of sublease space is a natural by-product of that. The reduction is attributable both to tenants expanding and others deciding to keep space they previously planned to give up.”

Bitcoin has enjoyed attention as one of the most rewarding stores of value in recent years, with institutional adoption reaching new highs this year. One such landmark Bitcoin acquisition was made by Harvard University, arguably the world’s most prestigious academic institution. Earlier in August, Harvard disclosed an investment portfolio containing $117 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) as of the end of Q2. According to its latest disclosure, the university’s BTC exposure nearly tripled over the last quarter. In its latest 13F filing, Harvard University revealed that it held 6,813,612 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) valued at approximately $443 million as of September 30. This additional acquisition highlights the institution’s expansive capital allocation strategy, which also saw its SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) holdings grow to 661,391 shares (worth approximately $235 million) in 2025 Q3. Notably, Harvard’s current holding of the leading spot BTC ETF represents a 257% increase from the disclosed 1,906,000 shares declared as of June. As of now, BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund is the single largest investment of the university’s reported holdings. While the current IBIT position makes only a small portion of Harvard’s endowment of $57 billion, it is significant enough to make the university the 16th-largest IBIT holder. As inferred earlier, stories of institutional adoption such as this further add credence to Bitcoin’s status as a strategic reserve asset and the growing demand for exchange-traded funds. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X: It’s super rare/difficult to get an endowment to bite on an ETF- esp a Harvard or Yale, it’s as good a validation as an ETF can get. That said, half a billion is a mere 1% of total endowment. Big enough to rank 16th among IBIT holders tho. The US-based Bitcoin ETFs have suffered waning investor demand in recent weeks, with the past week particularly disappointing. According to the latest market data, the exchange-traded funds registered a total net outflow of $1.1 billion in the past week. Leading these withdrawals was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, which is currently on a three-day outflow streak. Data from SoSoValue shows that $463.1 million flowed out of the BTC ETF on Friday, November 14. As of this writing, BlackRock’s IBIT still ranks as the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, with net assets worth roughly $74.98 billion. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

A JUDGE HAS stated it will be alleged that a former sales associate with high end retail brands in Dublin “was caught red handed” with two suitcases containing €620,000 worth of cannabis by the carousel at Shannon airport last week. At Ennis District Court, Judge Alec Gabbett made his comment in the case where Sean Grehan (28) of Stradbrook Park, Blackrock, Dublin appeared in court after being charged with two alleged drugs offences arising from the airport seizure last Wednesday. At the conclusion of a contested bail hearing, Judge Gabbett remanded Grehan in custody with consent to bail on condition that Grehan provide a €20,000 cash surety. Counsel for Grehan, Sorcha Dianamh Ní Néill Fulham BL, told Judge Gabbett that her client “doesn’t have cash at present”. Gardaí objected to bail and Garda Kevin Molloy said that it will be alleged that a passenger from an inbound Boston flight, Sean Grehan, was detected by customs officers to have two 20kg suitcases at Shannon airport last Wednesday containing 31kg of cannabis with an estimated street value of €620,000. Garda Molloy said that it will be alleged that Grehan was due to pass the two suitcases to another person after getting through customs at Shannon airport. Garda Molloy said that gardaí were objecting to bail based on the seriousness of the charge and the strength of evidence against Mr Grehan in the case. Advertisement Garda Molloy said that Grehan by his own admission has incurred a significant drugs debt due to his addiction to cocaine “and admitted that he has taken a serious amount of cocaine over the last number of years”. Garda Molloy said that the suspected cannabis is to be tested at the Forensic Science Ireland (FSI). Judge Gabbett said that it will be alleged that Grehan “was caught red handed at the carousel at Shannon airport with two suit-cases full of drugs”. In response, Ms Ní Néill Fulham said that this would be a matter for evidence. Ms Ní Néill Fulham said that her client is a father of two children, aged seven and five, and has worked as a sales associate for a number of high end retail brands in Dublin. Ms Ní Néill Fulham expressed concern that if Grehan was to be remanded in custody the length of time it is taking FSI to test for drugs currently. In the case, Grehan is charged with at Shannon airport on November 12th having in his possession, cannabis for the purpose of sale or supply contrary to Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. Grehan is also charged with having in his possession cannabis on November 12th at Shannon airport contrary to Section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Judge Gabbett remanded Grehan in custody with consent to bail to appear before Ennis District Court via video link on Wednesday.

Title: Amazon’s LORD OF THE RING MMORPG Reportedly Cancelled After Massive Layoffs

For fans dreaming of returning to Middle-earth in a new, next-gen adventure, the news isn’t good. Amazon’s ambitious Lord of the Rings MMORPG, which had been in development since early 2023, has reportedly been cancelled. The project was meant to bring players back into Tolkien’s world with a fresh, modern spin, but development apparently stopped in October 2025. The report comes from Bloomberg, which revealed that Amazon began cutting roughly 14,000 jobs across the company in late October. Among those affected were many employees from Amazon Games, the publisher behind the long-awaited Lord of the Rings MMO. The cuts hit multiple divisions, but one key detail came from Ashleigh Amrine, a former Senior Gameplay Engineer, who confirmed on LinkedIn that she was among those laid off—and that the Middle-earth project was shelved. Amrine shared a bittersweet note: “Y’all would have loved it.” Amazon Games has been around since 2012, focusing primarily on publishing original titles. That focus seems to be shifting. In a memo released on October 28, 2025, the company cited “significant role reductions” at Amazon Games and outlined plans to concentrate more on its cloud gaming platform, Luna. The service primarily hosts existing titles, meaning fewer in-house game developments like the cancelled Lord of the Rings MMORPG. Despite the major shakeup, Amazon Games will continue work on March of Giants, a new Tomb Raider title, and other “casual and AI-focused games.” Still, losing such a massive and promising project sucks, not just for Amazon’s team, but for fans of Tolkien’s world who’ve been waiting for a new multiplayer experience since The Lord of the Rings Online launched back in 2007. That game, published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, remains beloved but very dated by today’s standards. The cancelled MMO could have been the perfect way to bring players back to a living, breathing Middle-earth with updated visuals, gameplay, and storytelling inspired by The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings novels. The cancellation is a lost opportunity for synergy. With Amazon already heavily invested in Tolkien’s universe through The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the MMORPG could have expanded on that world, offering fans a chance to explore events from before the Third Age—when Sauron’s power still loomed large and the One Ring had yet to be destroyed in Mount Doom. Unfortunately, that vision won’t be realized anytime soon. While there are still plenty of older Lord of the Rings games to revisit, it may be a long wait before another studio takes up the challenge of creating a new MMORPG set in Middle-earth. For now, it’s a somber end to what could have been a truly epic return to one of fantasy’s most iconic worlds.

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted November 16, 2025 by Ben Carlson Michael and I were out in Las Vegas last week to put on a live Animal Spirits at the annual FPA conference. It was a fun trip. We ate some good food, had some fancy cocktails, played some blackjack and talked some artificial intelligence with a few hundred financial advisors. On stage we did a deep dive into what’s going on with the biggest companies in the world and their push for AI supremacy. You can listen to the audio from the podcast here: If you weren’t one of the lucky people in the MGM conference center that day I thought it would be useful to provide some of the slides we covered in our presentation. First up we talked about the shift from investing in intangible to tangible assets by the big tech firms using Meta’s new Hyperion data center as an example: These companies believe AI is worth the investment but this is a risk and a change to their business models. Spending from the hyperscalers continues to go up, up and away: How long will stock market investors allow this? The companies spending money are getting the benefit of the doubt that this will all pay off. I do wonder when the market will want to see a big ROI on this spend. The sheer size of these companies is astounding: The Mag 7 stocks are now as big as the bottom 449 stocks in the S&P 500 combined. It seems we’ve entered the new normal of stock market concentration: At least for now. One of the reasons for this is that fundamentals are matching the stock price gains: Nvidia is now the biggest company in the U.S. stock market but the fundamental growth has exceeded the price growth since the release of ChatGPT. Analysts expect the growth to continue: Is it possible for a $5 trillion company to grow at these insane levels for this long? We shall see. Here’s a real face-blower for you: Apple and Nvidia alone are now worth nearly as much as the health care and consumer staples sectors combined. Here’s another one for you — the market cap of the Mag 7 stocks is now the same size as the energy, materials, consumer staples, health care, financials, utilities and real estate sectors combined. There have been instances of stock market concentration in the past. But we’ve never had corporations this efficient before. If you take this efficiency into account by adjusting valuations for the changes in margins, the market doesn’t appear as expensive as you might think: One of the biggest questions of the AI boom is how much the other companies that aren’t making these investments will benefit. Outside of tech, the margins are much smaller: Will AI improve productivity enough for some of these other companies to increase their margins? That would be something. And finally — the question everyone wants to know — will this end badly for these huge companies? The Mag 7 is no stranger to crashes this decade: When the expectations get out of whack will we see some or all of these stocks crash? And what does a crash look like? A 20% decline is nothing. Meta is down more than 20% from the highs right now: Are we looking at a 40% crash? 50% or more? Would an AI bubble popping offer a wonderful buying opportunity because these companies are still better at what they do than everyone else? Or what if these companies see a payoff sooner than we think and the gigantic crash never comes? I have three words to sum up my conclusion on the matter: I. Don’t. Know. If anyone tells you they know how this will play out they have a horrible case of hubris or just want their investment stance to be proven right. I remain open to a wide range of outcomes on the matter.

Title: AI Companies Are Treating Their Workers Like Human Garbage, Which May Be a Sign of Things to Come for the Rest of Us

By Joe Wilkins Published Nov 16, 2025 9:00 AM EST In today’s economy, tech companies are red hot. In fact, the companies burning cash on AI seem to be some of the only ones having a truly great time, as the corporate rate of profit plummets throughout the US and recession fears loom. Though one economist estimates tech companies accounted for 92 percent of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025, you wouldn’t know it by looking at their staff rosters — which seem to be plummeting at an alarming rate. Amazon, for example, recently laid off 14,000 corporate employees, despite posting billions in profits across numerous lines of business. Across the month of October, tech workers made up the highest number of layoffs in any industry, leading the charge in one of the worst single months for furloughs since 2003. That’s bad news, of course, but it also directly contradicts the AI industry’s promises of — in the words of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — ushering in “a world in which humanity flourishes to a degree that is probably impossible for any of us to fully visualize yet.” Sadly, as Business Insider reports, the bloodbath is far from over. On Tuesday, the AI grading company Mercor — which has massive contracts with corporations like OpenAI and Anthropic — suddenly announced it was shuttering a huge project with Meta, leaving workers scrambling. The Meta Project, called Musen, employed some 5,000 data labelers at its peak, and was previously expected to last until at least 2026, according to BI. “They kept stressing how happy the client was and how it got extended until the end of the year,” one contractor told the publication. “So to then do this major switch up before the holidays took everyone by surprise.” Luckily for those workers, Mercor is offering to hire them back — just not for Musen. Instead, they’ll have the opportunity work on an extremely similar project named “Nova.” The main difference, it seems, is the wage offered: while Musen’s base contract was $21 an hour, Nova’s opens at $16. Two tech workers offered a Nova contract said the offer email explained the difference in pay is due to “steadier task volumes across multimedia content” and “higher hour caps, enabling greater weekly engagement.” In other words, data labelers — who already had a bum deal as stable jobs become temporary contract work — get to work more for less pay. One employee who accepted a contract to work on Nova told BI the work is functionally the same, “but for $5 less an hour.” “It sounds like most of us are in the same boat,” the worker added. “We wanted to boycott this but are not in a financial place to do so. We needed to have the guaranteed income, even if it’s demoralizing.” The whole episode underscores the false promises beneath the AI boom: jobs are being degraded, the number of “freelance workers” is soaring, AI-generated profit is almost nonexistent, and rising tides on Wall Street certainly aren’t raising all boats. If this is how the most powerful companies in the world are treating workers now, why would the AI “utopia,” as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella calls it, be any different? What’s more, if the companies on the cutting edge of a supposed “technological revolution” can’t be expected to take care of their employees, what hope do the rest of us have?

Title: Harvard University boosts its BlackRock Bitcoin ETF investment to $442.8m

About us Copy link The Ivy League has given Bitcoin exchange-traded funds another seal of approval, with Harvard University bolstering the size of its holdings by almost 260%. That’s according to disclosures in a Harvard Management Company filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The Harvard Management Company, launched in 1974, manages Harvard University’s endowment and other financial assets, making stock market investments on the university’s behalf. The filing shows that, as of its latest filing, the company’s holdings in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, were worth $442.8 million. As of September 30, Harvard University owned 6.81 million IBIT shares. The university’s financial managers made their first IBIT investment in the second quarter of FY2025, taking up a $116.7 million position in the BlackRock-run Bitcoin ETF. In August, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst noted that “endowments are the hardest institution to hook,” as “they rarely bite on ETFs.” This trend appears to have been turned on its head. The dollar value of Harvard’s BTC ETF investment dwarfs the combined total of its holdings in the blue-chip tech stocks Meta, NVIDIA, and the Google operator Alphabet. The filing also shows that IBIT is Harvard’s biggest ETF purchase, and its largest single investment in terms of dollar worth. And Harvard is not the only member of the Ivy League buying up Bitcoin ETF shares. SEC data shows that Brown University owns 212,500 IBIT shares, worth $13,007,125 when it filed with the SEC on August 8. The Harvard filing, meanwhile, also shows that the university’s fund managers are turning to gold. They have snapped up 661,391 shares in the gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares. Harvard’s holdings in gold shares are worth $235 million. The rest of Harvard’s portfolio is primarily made up of tech stocks. The university holds significant positions in firms like Microsoft, as well as the chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom. It also holds stocks in the gambling giants Light & Wonder and Flutter Entertainment. Pension funds across the United States have begun buying Bitcoin ETF shares in recent years. But sell-offs have also become increasingly common. Earlier this year, Wisconsin’s Investment Board sold the entirety of its $300 million holdings in the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. This month has also seen some investors liquidate their holdings. On November 8, the CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn noted that Bitcoin ETF flows have “dropped by about $2.3 billion from their peak.” This marks the “largest outflow since May 2025,” he added. May saw investors withdraw a total of $4.8 billion from Bitcoin ETFs. Tim Alper is a news correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email at tdalper@dlnews.com.

By Sept. 30, that same $10,000 IBIT position had reached approximately $25,000, translating to a 150% return in under two years. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. A $10,000 wager on BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) at launch would be worth $19,870 today, nearly double the return of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, and edging past gold’s own stellar run. However, that 98.7% gain masks the bigger picture that, for several months in 2025, IBIT holders were sitting on returns exceeding 150%, watching their initial stake balloon past $25,000 before Bitcoin’s recent stumble below six figures pulled those gains back to earth. The comparison isn’t close when measured over the 22-month window since IBIT’s Jan. 5, 2024, inception. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both delivered respectable returns of 42-43%, an impressive feat given that they posted back-to-back years of 25% or more, a rarity that has occurred only three times since 1871. Gold, driven by geopolitical anxiety and central bank buying, came closest with gains of 92-93%. Yet Bitcoin’s trajectory carved a different path entirely, one defined less by steady compounding than by violent swings that rewarded conviction and punished hesitation. By Sept. 30, that same $10,000 IBIT position had reached approximately $25,000, translating to a 150% return in under two years, according to a BlackRock filing with the SEC. Bitcoin traded near $115,000 per coin by then, IBIT shares hovered around that level, and the narrative shifted from “institutional adoption” to “how high can this go?” The 2.5x milestone represented not just arithmetic success but psychological vindication for allocators who endured skepticism about crypto’s place in portfolios governed by Sharpe ratios and correlation matrices. Then came October, and Bitcoin registered a new all-time high above $126,000, with IBIT shares priced at $71,29, before sliding through its short-term holder cost basis. The movement triggered cascading liquidations across futures markets, and the leverage that amplified the climb accelerated the descent. As of press time, Bitcoin traded at $96,612.79, and IBIT traded at $54.84, making those September highs look like a mirage. The drawdown from peak erased roughly $6,000 in paper value per initial $10,000 invested, a reminder that Bitcoin’s uncorrelated returns cut both ways. The equity indices delivered a textbook performance: the S&P 500 achieved its third consecutive year of double-digit gains, and the Nasdaq 100, propelled by the “Magnificent Seven,” saw earnings growth averaging 21.6% year-over-year. Both suffered manageable drawdowns, traded within established ranges, and validated decades of mean-reversion research. Gold’s 52% year-to-date surge through November 2025 stemmed from macroeconomic dislocation, fueled by tariff uncertainty, Fed pause dynamics, and record central bank purchases, rather than speculative mania. Its correlation to equities stayed negative, fulfilling its portfolio role as designed. IBIT offered none of that predictability, with a 98.7% gain since inception deriving from a single-asset bet on a protocol with no earnings, no dividends, and no intrinsic cash flow to discount. The volatility that allowed a 150% peak also permitted a 25% collapse in weeks. Traditional risk models would categorize that profile as unacceptable, and traditional risk-adjusted returns would penalize the path even as they acknowledged the destination. Yet, the path matters less than the outcome for capital deployed at inception. The investor who bought IBIT on day one and held through the September peak, the November pullback, and every subsequent liquidation cascade still outperformed every major benchmark by a margin wide enough to survive transaction costs, tax drag, and multiple moments of doubt. That investor also experienced standard deviation in returns that would make compliance officers flinch and risk committees demand explanations. IBIT’s performance doesn’t just reflect Bitcoin’s price appreciation, it captures the infrastructure that’s been built around crypto as an asset class instead. Spot ETF approval removed custody risk for institutions allergic to private keys and hardware wallets. BlackRock’s brand provided regulatory air cover. The CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate gave auditors a benchmark they could defend. Together, these developments transformed Bitcoin from “digital gold held by ideologues” into “trackable exposure tradeable through Schwab.” That wrapper mattered when Bitcoin tested six figures. ETF inflows of $1.2 billion exiting in November didn’t represent panic, but rather rebalancing, profit-taking, and tactical repositioning by allocators who could now treat Bitcoin like any other liquid asset. The same pipes that channeled $37 billion into IBIT over its first year also allowed nearly $900 million to exit on a single day on Nov. 13, without breaking the market. Liquidity is the tax that professionals pay for access, and IBIT’s structure efficiently collects that tax. The futures markets told the rest of the story. Open interest swelled to $235 billion by mid-October before contracting as long positions unwound. Funding rates remained subdued even as prices tested support, indicating that traders had de-risked rather than doubled down. Options skew favored puts by 11% in implied volatility, pricing protection against sub-$100K tests that arrived on schedule. The infrastructure didn’t prevent volatility. It simply made volatility tradeable, insurable, and therefore tolerable for capital that demands both. Comparing IBIT to the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 assumes they’re solving for the same mandate, which they’re not. Equity indices provide exposure to aggregate corporate earnings growth, diversified across sectors, with governance structures and disclosure requirements that mitigate downside risk. IBIT offers exposure to a fixed-supply monetary protocol with no recourse, no management team to fire, and no quarterly guidance to parse. The former compounds through dividend reinvestment and multiple expansion, while the latter compounds through network effects and adoption curves that either validate the thesis or don’t. Gold sits closer to the spectrum, with no cash flows, no earnings, valued for its scarcity and institutional acceptance. However, gold’s 5,000-year history as a store of value gives it mean-reversion characteristics that Bitcoin lacks. When gold rallies by 50% in a year, the assumption is that it will revert to its long-term average. When Bitcoin rallies 150%, the assumption is either a paradigm shift or speculative excess, with no consensus on which. That uncertainty is the premium IBIT investors pay for asymmetry. The 98.7% return since inception, the peak in October, and the 25% drawdown since all reflect the fact that Bitcoin’s volatility is an inherent asset characteristic, not a bug to engineer away. The institutions that purchased IBIT were aware of this. The 19-month outperformance against traditional benchmarks compensated them for enduring it. Whether that trade continues to work depends less on Fed policy or ETF flows than on whether enough capital decides that the volatility is worth the option value embedded in a non-sovereign, programmatically scarce bearer asset. For the investor who placed $10,000 into IBIT at launch and now holds $19,870, the answer is already clear. For the one who sold at nearly $25,000 in September, the answer is more precise still. And for the allocator still running Monte Carlo simulations on the role of crypto in a 60/40 portfolio, the question remains open. And this is exactly why the returns appear as they do.

Title: Americans have plenty of excuses for not investing. None of them stand up to this simple piece of advice from Warren Buffett.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than one-third of Americans do not own stocks, and a new BlackRock survey reveals that the holdouts cite a lot of reasons for not being in the market. In its People & Money report published on Thursday, BlackRock listed some of the reasons people who don't invest say they stay on the sidelines. Among the most common are not having enough money, not feeling like they know enough about investing, and being afraid of losses. Those are all fair explanations for not putting your money to work. But there is one simple piece of advice from investing icon Warren Buffett that offers a solution to each one of them: invest in an S&P 500 index fund, a product that tracks the performance of roughly the 500 largest stocks in the US. "Over the years, I've often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I've learned a good deal about human behavior," Buffett said in his 2017 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. "My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index fund." So, let's go through each of the above reasons, starting with the toughest: not having enough money. If you've never done it, investing is something that can feel like you need thousands of dollars saved up to start. In reality, there are some very low-cost entry points. For example, the Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX) trades at around $17 a share. You can also buy fractional shares of funds that trade at a higher price level, but it's more or less all the same in the end. While investing small amounts may seem futile, it's more about getting started and building habits — after a few years, if you keep at it, you'll have built up a chunk of money thanks to both your contributions and compounding returns. Second: not feeling like you know enough about investing. Financial markets can feel daunting, but like anything, once you do it, it gets easier. Plus, the beauty about buying an index fund is that you don't really need to know much about investing. Your money will passively sit in a diversified group of stocks for years. If you really feel that you have questions that need to be addressed, however, you can always visit a physical branch of an advisor like Charles Schwab or Fidelity, said Chris Chen, a certified financial planner and founder of Insight Financial Strategists. "They have people at the counter there who are waiting for them to invest their money and answer their questions, and they're basically free," Chen told Business Insider. Finally: being afraid that you'll lose money. It's what keeps even the most successful investors up at night. But the reality is that, if you have a long-term time horizon and resist the urge to sell at the first sign of trouble, the S&P 500 has historically recovered from its pullbacks. Earlier this year, Yale economist William Goetzmann told Business Insider that investors tend to overestimate the odds of an imminent stock market crash and tend to forget that such crashes don't last. Goetzmann's research shows that when the market plunges after a big period of returns, there's a 99% chance those losses have been recovered five years later. "If you wait five years after this event, you're going to be better off. That's what I'm telling you," he said. Of course, S&P 500 index funds aren't the only products out there. Jason Draho, the head of asset allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, said that he would rather people invest in an all-world index fund — one example would be Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) — as S&P 500 valuations are high and the index is heavily concentrated in a select few stocks. US stocks have outperformed the rest of the world over the last decade and a half. Since the March 2009 market lows, the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF is up 423% while the S&P 500 is up 800%. So far this year, however, the US has underperformed international stocks, and some Wall Street analysts see global markets beating the US in the coming years. There's also something to be said about the visibility of the S&P 500 — it's the benchmark that US investors tend to follow, and you can track its performance on the nightly news. But in the end, it doesn't matter all that much — it's more about getting the ball rolling. "The important part for someone who is just starting is to start," Chen said. Jump to

Title: The Harvard Endowment’s Biggest Public Investment is Now Bitcoin
URL: https://gizmodo.com/the-harvard-endowments-biggest-public-investment-is-now-bitcoin-2000686439
Time Published: 2025-11-16T10:00:00Z

Reading time 3 minutes According to a new SEC filing, the Harvard University endowmentâs largest publicly-traded investment is now in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which is a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) operated by Blackrock. The filing indicates the endowment increased its holdings of IBIT from 1,906,000 shares to 6,813,612 shares since its previous such report.Â At current prices, the value of those IBIT holdings sits at around $364 million. This is already down rather heavily from the roughly $443 million valuation included in the filing, as bitcoinâs price has recently been struggling and now appears stuck under the $100,000 mark. As pointed out by MacroScope on X, another notable, and perhaps related, aspect of this recent filing is the 99% increase in gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares as well. Bitcoin is now Harvard’s largest reportable public investment. Larger than Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and others. See link below for the list.Of course Harvard’s total endowment is much larger and includes private investments that aren’t publicly reported. But yesterday’s BTCâ¦ https://t.co/OsV0XFAb6N In addition to their notable bitcoin and gold holdings, the Harvard University endowment also reported large investments in tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet (Googleâs parent company).Again, it should be noted that this SEC filing only covers the endowmentâs holdings in the public markets. According to a recent report by Reuters, the total size of the Harvard University endowment sits at roughly $57 billion, with only 14% of that being held in public equities. That valuation would indicate the endowmentâs holdings in IBIT represent less than 1% of its overall portfolio. However, itâs definitely possible that the endowment also has bitcoin exposure in some of its privately-held investments.According to Forbes, Harvard has the largest endowment among all universities.Growing Trust in Bitcoin as a Store of Value Of course, Harvard is not going out on a limb on their own in terms of their bitcoin holdings. In terms of university endowments with bitcoin exposure, there have been reports pointing to fellow Ivy leaguers Brown and Yale, in addition to many others.These endowment funds tend to be focused on long-term, fundamental value rather than short-term trades based around temporary hype. And interest in bitcoin from these sorts of funds focused on longer timeframes more generally has continued to develop over time. In addition to university endowments, various state pension funds everywhere from Michigan to Florida also have exposure to bitcoin via spot ETFs or bitcoin treasury company Strategy. Bitcoin exposure can also be found in the sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi, Norway, and other nations. ðºð¸ NEW: 14 US states have reported $632m in $MSTR exposure for Q1, in public retirement and treasury funds.A collective increase of $302m in one quarter. The average increase in holding size was 44%. pic.twitter.com/0PKm1avcPR Nation-states, Fortune 500 companies, central banks, and other large entities are also increasingly viewing bitcoin as a reserve asset in place of U.S. treasuries, gold, or other alternatives. Just this past week, the Czech National Bank announced its first bitcoin purchase for the purpose of evaluating the potential addition of the crypto asset to their international reserves, despite objections from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.Of course, the establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve was also a campaign promise made by now President Donald Trump, but such a reserve has yet to materialize.While those more aligned with Bitcoinâs original cypherpunk ethos are becoming increasingly worried about the extremely prevalent use of third-party bitcoin custodians by the vast majority of these large institutions, this type of adoption does at least still enable the intended removal of trust in terms of the crypto assetâs underlying, unwavering monetary policy. However, there still seems to be plenty of work to be done when it comes to other cypherpunk values, such as the decentralization of payments and financial privacy, as illustrated by the crypto industryâs heavy embrace of stablecoins.

Title: How laid-off Amazon workers are coping with the shock and planning their next career moves

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's been a few weeks since Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, but many laid-off employees are still coming to terms with it. While the original announcement cited a need to be leaner in the age of AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said, "It's about culture." Business Insider spoke with six former Amazon employees who lost their jobs in the latest round of layoffs. One was an anonymous single parent who said they'd just moved to Seattle in June due to the company's return-to-office mandate — only to be laid off. Another, an anonymous former product manager, said he got wind of the layoff timing and set his alarm for 3 a.m. that day to check his email. The unexpected nature of the layoffs — and the tough job market — are among the factors making it harder for some workers to move on. Here is a selection of their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity. Iren Azra Zou: Software engineer, 27, based in New Jersey. Employed at Amazon for roughly one year. I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. When I tried to log in to my work account, I received authorization denied errors. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off. John Paul Martinez: Technical support engineer, 35, based in Orlando. Employed at Amazon for over three years. I received an email at 5 a.m. EST from HR advising that I'd been laid off. James Hwang: IT support engineer, 27, based in Michigan. Employed at Amazon for roughly four years. I got an automated text message from Amazon telling me to check my personal email before clocking in, and then I saw an email from HR. I was home at the time. Joanelle Cobos: Design manager, 37, based in Las Vegas. Employed at Amazon for roughly four years. I was at home getting ready to head to the office, and I happened to notice two text messages from Amazon that looked like spam, asking me to click a link or check my email. Since I didn't trust the texts, I went to my work laptop and signed in, only to be met with a message saying that my account had been disabled. At this point, I was already guessing that my position had been eliminated. Zou: There were rumors the day before that something big was coming. I had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be one of them, even though I was performing well — I had met my goals earlier than expected. This wasn't the first time budget cuts had affected me in my career, and I know how, in these situations, people can become numbers on a spreadsheet. So I was surprised — but also not surprised. Martinez: Extremely surprised, since we were not given any indication of this massive layoff, and we are heading into the holidays. Hwang: Very surprised. I was a high performer who did a lot for our organization, and IT employees had been safe in the last couple of rounds of layoffs. There's a lot of work to do, and we were already low on team members Cobos: Not terribly. I was hired in December 2021, and my tenure had been plagued by whispers of voluntary resignation programs and RIFs, basically once a year. This is also my third layoff since 2019 and my fourth in my career, so I plan my life around the very real possibility of being laid off.

Read more on the topic: Zou: My husband was next to me in bed and awake, so he was the first person I told. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers as we tried to figure out who else had been affected. When I learned that some literal rock stars on my team also got laid off, I was shocked. Martinez: I reached out to my colleague, who worked with me in the same capacity at Amazon, to see if she had also received the email or if this was a joke or a complete misunderstanding. Hwang: My wife and my parents. Cobos: My mother, sisters, and I have a group chat. I sent them a message once I had confirmed everything and read through my announcement letter. They were surprised. Zou: I made it a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, my sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic. I think I built some Legos, talked to friends and coworkers, and read a book. I just gave myself space to process. Martinez: I broke down crying, not understanding what had occurred that morning. I started to think about all the expenses — mortgage, car payment, credit cards, and my father's medical bills. Hwang: I just processed what happened and looked over my résumé. Cobos: I spent that evening at home enjoying myself. The idea of having so much free time ahead of me, even with the need to find new employment, is exciting. Zou: I'm already looking for new opportunities. I'm not rushing, though — I want to find a good fit. I'm leaning toward a smaller company where there's less bureaucracy and more space to contribute and see the impact of my work. Martinez: I have been actively searching for employment. However, due to the massive layoffs at Amazon and other corporations, I am extremely fearful of the competition. Hwang: I have been looking for a new role in cloud support or it system engineering. Cobos: I'm looking into starting my own small business that can potentially provide income while I'm unemployed and additional income once I find new full time employment. I'm not in a rush to jump into another corporate job, even though that's where the best income is. Ideally, I'd like to take a lower-stress, lower-paying job with good health benefits and bridge the financial gap with income from my own business. Zou: You can't help but ask yourself, "Why me?" But eventually you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table. A layoff doesn't erase that, and I'm not going to let it make me question my value. Now, I see the layoff as a turning point. It helped me clarify what I want in my next role: more ownership, clearer growth, and a healthier environment. It's still a difficult experience, but I'm feeling more grounded and optimistic as time goes on. Martinez: My feelings have not changed. I think Amazon has done a poor job of communicating with everyone regarding our benefits, stock options, severance package, and job placement assistance. Hwang: It's been a shock. The current job market has been crazy hard. I already applied to 100 jobs and haven't gotten any interviews yet, so I'm concerned, but I have to keep going. Cobos: My feelings on the layoff haven't changed. I'm not a fan of how it was handled, but I'm honestly excited for the time and opportunity to reexamine what I want to do and explore my options. This layoff has forced me to take time to reflect. Jump to

There was drama in the top of the table clash in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League as Terenure College won the D6W derby against St Mary’s College 14-12 in a tense, tactical affair at Lakelands. Tries from John McKee and Oisín McCormack, both converted by Chris Cosgrave, gave Nure just enough breathing room to survive four Mick O’Gara penalties. Defending champions Clontarf picked up a 17-3 win away to Cork Constitution at Temple Hill in a repeat of last season’s decider. Fionn Gilbert’s brace, one in each half, proved the catalyst, Conor Kelly added two conversions and a penalty. Con’s sole reply came from an Aidan Moynihan penalty deep in the first half. UCD climbed out of the drop zone with a 34-12 bonus-point win over Young Munster in Belfield. A quickfire Evan Moynihan double before half-time set the tone, and second-half tries from Michael O’Reilly, Dan Barron, and Daniel Hurley pushed the Students comfortably clear. Lansdowne surged to a 36-11 victory at Old Belvedere. Andy Marks and Bobby Sheehan both crossed twice, with George Morris adding a fifth try deep into stoppage time. Charlie Tector contributed five conversions and a penalty from the tee. Belvo stayed in sight during the first half through Daragh O’Dwyer’s penalties and an Andre Ryan try, but couldn’t contain Lansdowne in the second half. Ballynahinch impressed again in a 24-3 win away to Nenagh Ormond, scoring twice in each half with Tom McAllister, Aaron Sexton, Bradley Luney and Sam Warwick all crossing for tries In Division 1B, Garryowen produced a strong second-half push to win 29-15 away to City of Armagh, with Fionn Rowsome grabbing a clinical hat-trick. Instonians turned things around late on to defeat Highfield 17-15, while Naas overturned a half-time deficit to beat Blackrock College 32-20. Leaders Old Wesley overcame rivals Trinity 30-16, while UCC got their first win of the season, defeating Queen’s 27-12. There were narrow wins for Banbridge, MU Barnhall, and Corinthians in Division 2A, Ballymena staged a remarkable comeback from 17-0 down at the half to beat Cashel 29–23, while Shannon ground out a valuable 10–7 victory at Greystones. In 2B, Galwegians delivered an empathetic 43-21 win against UL Bohemian in their top of the table clash, Clogher Valley struck twice late on to beat Enniscorthy, while Skerries also struck late against Buccaneers to win 25-23.

Title: Apple is ramping up succession plans for CEO Tim Cook and may tap this hardware exec to take over, report says

Apple’s board of directors and senior executives have been accelerating succession plans for Tim Cook, sources told the Financial Times. After serving as CEO for 14 years, Cook may step down as early as next year, the report said. Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering, 50-year-old John Ternus, is widely seen as the most likely successor, but no final decisions have been made yet, sources told the FT. The engineer joined Apple’s product design team in 2001 and has overseen hardware engineering for most major products the tech company has launched ever since, according to Ternus’ LinkedIn profile. He has also played a prominent role during Apple’s most recent keynotes, introducing products like the new iPhone Air. Ternus had been rumored to be Cook’s potential successor, according to previous reports. The company is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, and an early-year announcement would allow a new leadership team time to settle in before its annual events, the FT said. The succession preparations have been long-planned and are not related to the company’s current performance, which is expecting strong end-of-year sales, people close to Apple told the FT. Apple did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment and declined to provide a comment to the FT. The $4 trillion company is expecting year-on-year revenue growth of 10% to 12% for its holiday quarter ending in December, fueled by the release of the iPhone 17 model in September. Ternus would take the helm of the tech giant at an important time in its evolution. Although Apple has seen sales success with iPhones and new products like Airpods over the past couple of decades, it has struggled to break into AI and keep up with rivals. Instead, Apple has even spending significantly less in AI investments compared to Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Apple has been criticized by analysts this year for not having a clear AI strategy. And despite approving a multibillion-dollar budget to run its own models via the cloud in 2026, it was reported in June that Apple is even considering using models from OpenAI and Anthropic to power its updated version of Siri, rather than using technology the company has built in-house. Its AI-enabled Siri, originally slated for 2025, will be delayed until 2026 or later due to a series of technical challenges, the company announced earlier this year. Apple has also lost a number of senior AI team members since January, many of whom have joined Meta’s AI and Superintelligence Labs during talent poaching wars this year. The exodus of Apple’s AI execs included Ruoming Pang, former head of Apple’s foundation models and core generative AI team, who joined Meta with a compensation package reportedly worth $200 million. The company is also dealing with increased competition from one of its most influential former employees. In May, Sam Altman’s OpenAI acquired startup io for about $6.5 billion, bringing in former Apple chief designer Jony Ive to build AI devices. The 58-year-old designer was instrumental in creating the iPhone, iPod, and iPad. Cook, Apple’s former operations chief, turned 65 this month. He has grown the company’s market capitalization to $4 trillion from $350 billion in 2011, when he took over the CEO role from company co-founder Steve Jobs. Under Cook, Apple became the first publicly traded company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2018—then it became the first company to reach $3 trillion in market cap in 2022. But more recently, its stock price has been lagging behind Big Tech rivals Alphabet, Nvidia, and Microsoft, though Apple is trading close to an all-time high after strong earnings were reported in October. Apple has also dealt with tariff complications as U.S.-China trade tensions have disrupted its supply chain. Cook has previously said he’d prefer an internal candidate to replace him, adding that the company has “very detailed succession plans.” “I really want the person to come from within Apple,” Cook told singer Dua Lipa last year on her podcastAt Your Service.

Title: Former ‘Good Morning America’ Host Joan Lunden on Distrust of the Media and AI Deepfakes: ‘A Really Sad State of Affairs’
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/joan-lunden-ai-deepfake-news-trust-good-morning-america-1236581678/

By Antonio Ferme Joan Lunden, the veteran journalist who co-anchored “Good Morning America” from 1980 to 1997, doesn’t mince her concerns about the current media landscape. “I think it’s a really sad state of affairs that a very big segment of the American population doesn’t know what to believe anymore,” Lunden told Variety earlier this month at 50th anniversary celebration of “GMA.’ “There’s so much fake news, videos, pictures. They don’t know whether it’s really you. That part of it makes me incredibly sad and upset. I don’t know if we can put the toothpaste back in the tube.” Related Stories AFM Earns High Praise for New L.A. Location, but Pricey Film Packages Turn Buyers Off: 'Expectations Haven’t Fully Adjusted to the Realities of the Market' Pathé Hires FilmNation's Ben Browning to Lead Big Expansion in English Language Production (EXCLUSIVE) While “GMA” remains a reliable ratings performer for ABC, more Americans are now getting their news from social media platforms. About half of Americans say they struggle to tell what’s true or not when they get news, according to a recent report from Pew Research Center. That confusion mirrors a broader collapse in trust in both news organizations and social platforms — a decline seen across political parties and age groups. Popular on Variety “I wish somehow we could right that ship,” Lunden said. “But with AI, I think we’re going to see losses of jobs in media, just like we’re seeing them in Amazon and everywhere else.” [Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attributed this year’s extensive layoffs to the company’s increased rollout of ‘generative AI and agents.’] After pausing for a moment, Lunden added, “But you know what? They can’t replace a host sitting there in that chair, saying good morning to you in the morning. There’s nothing that can be said for the chemistry of two people on the air.”Outside of AI-generated deepfakes, Lunden was also quick to acknowledge how she’s benefited from the new technologies ushered in since leaving “GMA” in 1997. She recalls feeling siloed from the audience she once greeted at every sunrise.“The hardest part of leaving was disconnecting from the American audience,” she said. “Because there was no social media, it was truly a disconnect. It kind of freaked me out.” That void was eventually filled when she first logged onto social media and reconnected with her old fans. When Lunden was on air, she had “reams of people [on staff] that did nothing but answer letters,” but the direct connection on social media was on a different level. “Pretty soon I had fifty thousand, sixty thousand followers, and my husband said, ‘You cannot be talking to all those people every day.’” She chuckled, “But boy, I give it a try.” The lively “GMA” celebration at Disney’s New York headquarters united Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos and Michael Strahan with Joan Lunden and fellow veterans Charlie Gibson and Diane Sawyer. The event followed the previous night’s airing of President Trump’s confrontational “60 Minutes” interview, his first since suing CBS over what he described as an altered version of Kamala Harris’ election-season appearance. The timing underscored the increasingly fraught relationship between politics, the press and the billionaire owners now shaping major media companies. “We obviously know that the major networks are little by little all becoming owned by the richest people in the world,” Lunden said. “We don’t want their opinions and their political viewpoints to seep into our business. But I’m a glass half full kind of girl. I really think that the journalism, as an industry, will be able to stand strong. We’ll still be here ten years from now celebrating the 60th anniversary, and you’ll still be able to ask me any question you want.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Time Published: 2025-11-15T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
with intense eagerness since 2012! a channel of the los angeles review of books The 2025 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays ended in elation or devastation, depending on what side of the ball and the 49th parallel you happened to be on. For us–two friends, former colleagues, and Filipino North Americans–the series’ 146 innings across seven games formed a tether of anxious codependency that could have easily toggled over into toxicity and bad blood. Instead, it deepened our mutual love of baseball, a dastardly game of inches (or as Adrian might say, centimeters), fickle momentum, painstaking rituals, and good old fashioned luck. It also reminded us why we each love Los Angeles and Toronto. One is a city besieged by relentless immigration raids against the Latinx fans who love the Dodgers most, putting the city and many of the team’s members at odds with its owner. The other is a city of immigrants from the Global South and elsewhere across the former British empire, held hostage by kleptocrats and landlords, whose sports teams are owned by the very telecommunication monopolies that make everyday life unaffordable. As a way of making sense of it all–the big feelings, the huge hangovers, the agony and the ecstasy, as Howard Cosell used to say–we’ve written an extended chronicle of our remote intimacies through this epic fall classic. It’s a love letter to our teams and our cities, and a glimpse at everything it takes for us, the fans, to help win a World Series. KT: The origins of my Dodgers fandom emerged, as it did for many Angelnxs my age, during peak Fernandomania in the early 1980s. My family immigrated from Manila to Los Angeles in 1983, just as I was about to turn ten-years-old. We landed at LAX in March amidst a catastrophic El Niño that brought a tornado to South Central Los Angeles. The part of me prone to mythologizing would take all the credit for finding my way to the boys in blue, especially Fernando Valenzuela, whose Brown, stocky frame and shaggy hair offered a heroic mirror for my tomboyishness during that era; a fresh-off-the-boat gender trouble that isolated me from the white suburban girls in my Inland Empire subdivision. Because I’d been on the road with my musician parents for the better part of three years, I took Calvert School correspondence courses. Were it not for the tutor my parents hired named Mike Thurman, who suggested I cultivate an interest in baseball to help juice my math lessons and my English writing skills, who knows what would’ve become of me. (My dad loves the Lakers, and prefers basketball to baseball, though he has since evolved into a bigger baseball fan thanks to his kid). My most treasured Dodger relic came to me as a result of Mike’s assignment to write a fan letter to my favorite player asking for an autograph. I picked the great Dominican 3rd baseman and the first Dodger ever to hit 30 homers and steal 20 bases, Pedro Guerrero. Pedro was the hero of the 1981 World Series clinching game 6 against the Yankees, with 5 RBIs and 8 total bases. Cut to forty-two years later and the only Guerrero on everyone’s minds is Toronto’s’ Vladdy, Jr. (no relation to the Dodgers’ Pedro, though he does have a much younger half-brother with the same name who can also ball, according to viral videos on the internet). Vladimir Guerrero, Jr. and the Blue Jays came off the ropes in the ALCS against the Seattle Mariners in 7 games, having been down 0-2 and 3-2, before clinching their World Series berth at home in front of a euphoric Rogers Centre and all of Canada. After cruising through the Wild Card against the Cincinnati Reds, and a taut but efficient NLDS against the favored Phillies, the Dodgers punched their ticket to the World Series with an NLCS sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers, the team with the most wins in the regular season. Needless to say, I was anxious AF as the World Series was about to begin. The Dodgers had been loafing around with a week off: plenty of time to get into their own heads before facing the Blue Jays, who just completed the kind of mojo making comeback that carries teams all the way to a championship. I knew Adrian was excited for the Jays’ first World Series appearance since 1993 (before he was born?), and we were communicating largely through Instagram stories and messages. I wasn’t sure how it would play out for either of us, our hometowns, or our friendship. ADL: So I was alive during the Jays’ last World Series, but I was still a kid in Manila! It would not be until 1998 when my family decided to leave our barangay (neighborhood) forever and make the journey across the Pacific. There was, I think, a future in which we could have moved to the US, and I could have been raised a Dodgers, Cubs, or Yankees fan. But for many reasons (like healthcare), we landed in Toronto one rainy Spring night, and bounced around the city’s immigrant and working-class east end of Scarborough. Now I confess – and anyone who knows me can attest to this – that, in terms of sports, my first love is basketball. My dad, who idolized Larry Bird, was a – puke – Celtics fan, and only once did we begrudgingly overlap, when Kevin Garnett won his championship. Outside of the Vince Carter-Tracy McGrady Raptors, I followed a hodgepodge of players, mostly power forwards like Garnett and Tim Duncan (my favorite basketball player of all time after Jimmy Butler). On the playground, everyone wanted to be an Allen Iverson or Kobe Bryant, as our frequently-sprained ankles attested. If basketball was the reliable main squeeze, baseball was the secret and passionate affair. And I mean secret, literally. My first baseball game was the first time I ever journeyed to downtown Toronto without my parents (with the blessing of a permission slip, of course). In my second and third (and fourth and fifth, ad nauseam) games, I eschewed bureaucratic approval, and commuted down with friends on the putatively free GO Train, which taught me the exquisite art of fare evasion. What began as the thrill of escaping a Very Catholic Household turned into an odyssey of being chased around the double-decker train by inspectors, sprinting off the train and jetting across Union Station, and snagging the cheap seats paid for by the parents of one of our token white friends, and jeering (and honestly, nervously so) at the Montreal Expos’ all-star designated hitter, Vladimir Guerrero…Senior. But it was the height of the Vince Carter Raptors, and I had no one to talk about how the fear that The Impaler struck into my heart, so MLB became something of an uncool thing to follow in those doldrum years. My fandom would have to be nourished elsewhere. On intramural softball, I was a middling third baseman, tolerated for my decent catch, later prized for my notoriously obstructive wide base (I was and remain a big boy). And, just as a piece of Canadiana for this write-up’s inevitably American audience, as kids, a popular game in gym class (which became intramural and local tournaments) was called Soccer Baseball. It wasn’t until this year that I learned that y’all Americans call it something else: Kickball. Then came 2015. Yes, I’m talking about the greatest and most swaggerific Jays team ever assembled before the 2025 season. Yes, I’m talking about icons Tulo and Pillar, and the imperturbable Donaldson. Yes, I’m talking about the invisible parrot perching on Edwin’s Edwing. Yes, I’m talking about Joey Bats. Yes, I’m talking about The Bat Flip. It is hard to overstate the intra-/inter-/trans-galactic convergences that imbued José Bautista’s iconic moment with the raw energy that exploded throughout the city after the repression of many disappointing years. For this Scarborough kid, that seventh inning was (and to me, remains) the greatest moment in Blue Jays history: tied at two apiece, after a 53-minute inning, Josh Donaldson on first and Kevin Pillar on third, Bautista at bat, one ball and one strike, Sam Dyson threw a fastball, and in the roaring din of the crowd – gone. While the American media was up in arms about the impoliteness (lol) of the gesture, we were passing around screenshots of our Dominican king in the group chats. For the kids from the ends, in other words, Canadian niceness was white people shit. Bautista was who we were, and who we wanted to be, at the same time. To this day, I can still recite the call: Bautista with the drive–Deep left field–NO DOUBT ABOUT IT! A couple of years after the 2015 ALDS, my relationship with my Jays would have to become a long distance one. I was about to move to Honolulu (and then to Seattle) on a Fulbright Scholarship. At my going-away party, one of my best friends surprised me with a Bautista jersey to wear on my sojourns. This is, incidentally, the only photo I have of me in Jays gear before this year. I gave the Bautista jersey to my brother, who still lives in Scarborough, and who wore it for the 2025 season. I know it sounds a little both-sides-ist, but by the time the World Series rolled around, and the Prince That Was Promised, Vladdy Jr. led my hometown team to new heights, I was torn. Half a decade (including the entire pandemic) in Los Angeles, along the esteemed artery of Temple Road that sutures Silver Lake, Echo Park, and Rampart Village into a Filipino enclave, and I had learned to become a Dodgers fan. Or more accurately, it was the deep Echo Park-ness of my former colleagues, especially Karen (superfan of all things Dodgers) and Natalia Molina (neighborhood historian and Los Doyers faithful) and Ana Iwataki (Little Tokyo curatorial nerd and consummate Asian American jock), who situated me in space. Being in that neighborhood, especially during 2020, taught me how to fall in love with Los Angeles. I bought my first car (whom I named Hybrid Jesus), took lockdown joyrides up and down the coast, went on my Stupid Mental Health Walks around the lake, and – most importantly – paraded down Echo Park loaded with cases of beer to hand out on the street. It was the year of the Lakers championship, the Dodgers championship, the presidential elections, and I came to adore the anarchic smell of burning rubber from the pickup trucks doing donuts on Sunset. Once the city “opened back up,” it was Dodgers games over spicy fried chicken at Crawfords, and dancing at Short Stop. Nonetheless. I can’t lie: it felt damn amazing to flaunt my Jays gear in New York, heckled by Public Enemy Number One (Yankees fans) and supported by the Charming Disasters (Mets fans). When Springer hit the homer that clinched our first World Series appearance since my former-non-Canadian ass was eleven months old, it was time to go to war. Even if it was against my other former home city. AdL: Man, I was WORRIED about this one. For a casual fan, it was easy to be optimistic. The Jays were locked in and warmed up, the team Loved Each Other, and they were riding the momentum of an epic ALDS on the back of the heroics of George Springer. But there was so much about the writing on the wall that made me uneasy: it would be Springer’s return to a playoff match against the Dodgers, and I feared (rightly) that the bad karma from the 2017 World Series would be Houston’s chief export to the city of Toronto. Not to mention that at the end of the day, the Jays are still A Toronto Sports Team: infamously unlucky. The perpetual underdog, and deservedly so, because for the most part, our teams tend to suck. I watched the game at the lobby bar of an indie theater in Williamsburg, where my partner was running the Brooklyn Horror Film Festival. With much foresight, she asked the theater to project the game onto the wall above the staircase, and I booked it to Union Square to catch the ironically-named L train, which I had hoped was not premonitory for anything. The theater ebbed and flowed with Brooklyn arts types and queer goths, often both at once, and at the bar, it became clear that I was the outlier sports fan when I was yelling at the wall with a Fernet in hand, long after everyone else had shoved their way into the auditorium. My god, did this game have some great story lines. After his meteoric rise from rookie in the minor leagues to playoff darling, my beautiful Pennsylvanian son (no relation) Trey Yesavage started for the Jays in Game 1. It wasn’t the dominant repeat of his surprise start in G6 of the ALCS, but he managed to hold his own for a respectable four innings. The bartender, who knew nothing about baseball, enthusiastically congratulated me, a Filipino dude in my young thirties, for My White American Son’s (no relation) successes midway through the third. Nights like G1 made me nostalgic for Old Twitter. I’d have been lighting it up across the feed on my old account, Swagapino Studies. Bluesky, the liberal suburb of microblogging platforms would have to do. And pleasantly, it turned out that other Skeeters (yes, that’s the unfortunate and legitimate Bluesky slang) had the same hankering, and on that platform, I found a decent dupe for the dopamine hits of a Night On Twitter. So when, at the bottom of the sixth, with bases loaded, my son (no relation) Addison Barger pinch-hit for Davis Schneider (for whom my partner yells GREAT MOUSTACHE whenever he shows up on screen), I knew what to do. Reader, I skeeted. KT: I didn’t like the vibes heading into game one in Toronto, especially because I had to watch in snippets while I was away at a conference in Houston of all places. Like every true Dodgers fan, I still carry the trauma of the 2017 World Series, in which the Houston Astros cheated the Dodgers out of a ring, adding insult to injury by doing it at Dodger Stadium in game 7. For these reasons, George Springer (the hero of the Jay’s G7 victory against Seattle in the ALCS) was my–nay every–Dodgers fan’s enemy number 1. Despite Blake Snell, aka Snellzilla’s (lol) dominance against the Phillies and the Brewers, I wasn’t sure how he’d fare against the Blue Jays’ relentless offense. With me and the Dodgers both on the road, I couldn’t hunker down for my usual obsessive-compulsive regime of superstitious rituals. The anxiety led me to drink way more beer than I intended (3 tallboys of Lone Star before first pitch) at the West Alabama Ice House known for their “ice cold” brew. Ricardo Montez, a Rice alum and Texas native brought me there because he thought I might “appreciate a place devoted to cold beer.” Reader, I am NOT a beer drinker. Not even at the stadium for home games. I do, however, appreciate the misrecognition, and I do love a “San Mig Ice” from the subzero coolers they use in Balikbayan bars in Manila. I appreciated it a bit too much that evening, despite drinking with a group of gays who also avoid beer (bc carbs), and who didn’t give a shit about baseball. I was already in poor form, matching Snell’s own, by the time we got to a celebratory dinner for a friend’s new book around the middle innings, as I vainly tried to resume my rituals, which involved drinking mezcal and soda ONLY WHEN the Dodgers were at bat. You can imagine how impossible it was to keep eyes on the game seated at a fancy dinner with eight other people. I only go to the bathroom when the Dodgers are at bat: one of many, painstaking game-watching rituals. Don’t ask me why (you don’t want to know). I’ve been doing it since 2020.That night, I couldn’t wait for a break because of the aforementioned tallboys, so I got up and went to the bathroom while the Jays were up in the bottom of the 6th. It was at that moment of sloppy “game management” on my part (or at least that’s what my twisted brain told me) that the Jays’ Addison Barger hit a grand slam off Anthony Banda, the lady Dodger fans’ favorite presumed “fuckboi,” who came in for Snell in relief. Barger made it 9-2 and essentially put G1 out of reach for the Dodgers. Many of you are probably aware of the idiom, “beer before hard, you’re in the yard,” meaning if you drink beer before hard liquor, you will (as the other saying goes) never be sicker. That night, beer before hard led to the Jays going yard multiple times. At least that’s what my twisted, superstitious psyche told me. Not even the lucky Dodgers tee tucked under my conference-appropriate button-down was going to save us. It was time to reset all the rituals and pass out back at the hotel, much to the chagrin of my friends and my spouse who witnessed my full descent into despair as I instructed the Uber driver to play TSwift’s “Father Figure” at full volume, while I sang along. KT: This was the first game that Adrian and I let ourselves chat beforehand. I interpreted it then as a magnanimous gesture from someone who felt really good because their team was up 1-0 in the series after a dominant performance. Other “casuals” who were watching the WS for the first time were not so kind to me on other social media platforms, with the Dodgers being the so-called ruiners of baseball for our Daddy Warbucks payroll. My public posture after G1 was that I was “too blessed to be stressed,” but the truth was I was languishing in the kind of depressive hungover state I’d experienced before in my younger days of conferencing, especially when my panel was scheduled at 9am local time as it was the morning of G2. I threw my now unlucky clothes and totems into a dirty laundry bag in my suitcase, and surrendered to the conference, knowing full well that I had another group dinner scheduled while G2 was scheduled to air. I was much more cautious and undertook a regime of rest and rehydration to prepare. Yoshinobu Yamamoto was on the mound that night, and he’d just thrown a complete 9 innings in his last start for the NLCS. Derek Jeter emphatically stated on the pregame show that Yoshi wouldn’t be able to do it again. Since everyone knew–and witnessed in G1–how the Dodgers’ bullpen was absolute ASS (and had been for most of the season), Yoshi’s unlikely capacity to “do 9 innings again” spelled more trouble for Los Doyers in Toronto. Yamamoto had a shaky start and I was worried he was on the path to Snellsville; but he managed to get out of a jam in the first with some heads-up defensive plays behind him. I exhaled and took up a new viewing ritual in the process: I reasoned that we’d make it through clean innings if I didn’t watch while we pitched. This was a convenient ritual to take up just as we arrived at a group dinner at the classic Houston Tex-Mex joint, Ninfa’s Original. Football was on all of Ninfa’s TVs, so I was in no danger of an errant glance a la Lot’s wife. Turns out the game was a pitchers’ duel between Yamamoto and Toronto’s Kevin Gausman, so I missed a lot. At one point, Gausman retired 17 Dodgers in a row as the game was knotted at 1, and it was looking bleak as our offense seemed flaccid once again. By the top of the 7th inning, I stopped hiding my phone and rudely propped it up against my modified lucky drink: mezcal and soda with THREE ORANGE SLICES (representing three clean outs for Yoshi), which was to be sipped only during Dodgers at-bats. It was at that moment that our fresh prince, Will Smith, the Dodgers’ catcher who opened the scoring earlier in G2 with an RBI single, homered for the go-head run putting the Dodgers up 2-1. Shortly thereafter, Max Muncy, “that funky Muncy” (sung to the tune of the Beastie Boys’ “Brass Monkey”) followed up with another solo homer to put the Dodgers up 3-1. The Dodgers went on to score two more in the top of the 8th after an extended Jonas Brothers’ performance of “I Can’t Lose” as part of the Mastercard-sponsored “Stand Up to Cancer” segment featured every year during the World Series. Some Toronto fans complained about how limber the 7th-inning-stretch was, allowing their pitcher to get cold. Of course, I tucked that song away for future use, turning it into an emergency totem. Yamamoto closed out all 9 innings of G2 for a final score of 5-1. Adrian reached out to me that night to call Yoshi’s performance a “master class,” and we traded photos of the “bad Yama Mamma” (sung to the tune of Carl Carlton’s “She’s a Bad Mama Jama…”) striking his own stretch like a “bad bitch,” as Dodgers fans love to say. AdL: Yeah, we got wrecked by Yoshi, or as Karen called him via text, “My Bad Bitch.” It was one thing to know his worth from that fat contract he signed, and it was another thing to witness why mercenaries (including pitchers) are one of the world’s oldest and best paid professions. And don’t get me wrong, I love Kevin Gausman. He earned his keep by shutting down the Dodgers offense early on. But I fear Yoshinobu Yamamoto more. After my brimming (oozing, overflowing, really) confidence after G1, I had to send Karen a text at the end of that game to congratulate her on behalf of her Bad Bitch, and I was certain that she was curled up and happily scrolling like that meme: The real suffering that night, though, was that one of my reliable neighborhood spots, my go-to hookah lounge, which was usually a font of good juju, was completely off. The live stream didn’t work, and I tried logging into my own accounts to find a decent stream, and ended up settling for a free seven-day trial of (yuck) Fox One. The entire time, a British woman kept yapping in my ear, complaining to me about how slow the food was taking five minutes after she ordered, ridiculing me for not being able to set up the stream (while admitting that she’d never worked a Roku her entire life), ranting about how grimy the East Village is, and groaning about how the establishment – a hookah lounge – smells like smoke. Yes, I blame Good King Charles’s loyal subject for this game’s seventh inning. But what’s baseball if not arbitrarily blaming inconveniences and constellational misalignments for your team’s loss? KT: Both the Dodgers and I were back in L.A. for G3 on Monday the 27th. I was feeling good and loose about the next three games, especially after the Dodgers stole one in Toronto, wrenching back the home-field advantage, and turning the series into a potential “best of 5.” I didn’t reach back out to Adrian that day, probably because I was feeling as smug as he did after G1. Plus, I didn’t want to jinx anything by consorting with a rival, especially because I had my whole set-up ready at home: Madre Mezcal Espadin on hand with limes harvested from my backyard, and a giant bottle of Tajin. Snacks were locked and loaded, and I even had a couple of chops defrosting in the fridge to make a wholesome dinner at home after a long day of teaching on campus. I dared to wear the same non-Dodgers clothes I wore for G2 at the Houston conference, and went to campus knowing the game would start just when my spouse and I had to drive home at 5pm. Our house is only 1.4 miles away from Dodger Stadium (I typically walk to games), and we were ensnared in the World Series traffic compounding an already gnarly rush hour down Alvarado into Echo Park. We listened to the first inning and a half on the car radio, and made it home in time to pour a lucky mezcal drink just before former-Blue Jay, Teoscar Hernandez homered to put the Dodgers up by 1 in the bottom of the 2nd. Shohei Ohtani followed with another towering solo shot at the end of the 3rd. Max Scherzer was on the bump for the Jays, and while I harbor less antipathy for him than for Springer, there is no love lost for “dead arm” Scherzer in Los Angeles. He acquired that reputation during his brief stint with the Dodgers in 2021, after he refused to pitch in the NLCS, citing his supposed “dead arm.” Many speculated he was just preserving himself for a monster free agency because his contract was ending. That evening, our foster cats’ “real parents,” Chelsea and Nick Berkofsky began texting us about the game. We ended up with their litter-mate tabbies, Speedy and Amelia, after the Altadena fires consumed their home in early January. The family had to downsize into a studio apartment in Echo Park with their other cat, their dog and their toddler. As bereaved cat parents who lost both of our beautiful littermates Lily and Corky within a calendar year, we offered to help the Berkofskys out with a long-term foster situation for at least two of their brood. The Blue Jays’ catcher, Alejandro Kirk clocked Tyler Glasnow with a three run homer in the top of the 4th, flipping the game upside down as the sports announcers like to say. It was then that Chelsea, a diehard Latina Dodgers fan, and I fully converted our group chat for Speedy and Amelia into a Dodgers anxiety thread. I changed my clothes back into my recently laundered lucky Dodgers shirt (featuring the 2024 World Series championship trophy), and stuck to my neurotic routine of not watching our pitching halves each inning. I also convinced myself that vigorous texting with the cat thread and other friends like Oliver Wang should be added to my many superstitious rituals. It seemed to work, because we’d tied the score again with “ribeye steaks” (i.e. RBIs) from Shohei in the 4th, and Freddie Freeman in the 5th. The Jays pulled ahead 5-4 again in the top of the 7th, and I knew it was time to experiment with an untapped resource: the Jonas Brothers’ “I Can’t Lose.” It worked. Shohei homered for the 2nd time in the bottom of the 7th to tie the game at 5-5. The score stayed stuck that way for another 11 innings. You can see the line of palm trees ringing Dodger stadium’s western slope from our living and dining room windows. With each passing inning and hour, the beleaguered “awwws” echoing from beyond the palms tipped me off around 30 seconds before each play aired that we hadn’t managed to walk it off yet. I also heard the roars of relief when Clayton Kershaw came in from the bullpen and got out of the jam in the top of the 12th. That single, crucial out would constitute his last appearance on the mound in his baseball home. The rest of the game unfolded as a blur of intentional walks to Shohei, a fruit platter delivered to the Blue Jays’ dugout, and guys whose names we never heard of deep in the roster. (L.A. sports teams’ fruit platter game goes HARD, as I learned from being an Angel City Football Club season ticket holder). Adrian and I had to break the tension, risking whatever bad juju might come for either of us as a result of talking to each other DURING a game instead of before or after. Despite the conciliatory tone of his final message, I knew Freddie’s walk-off homer in the bottom of the 18th, with shades of G1 in 2024, must’ve eviscerated Adrian as much as it elated me. It was time to shut up and go to bed. AdL: Already anxiety-struck with the dread of three games in Los Angeles, I came into the game doubly anxious about not being able to finish preparing for class. To ease the pain, I met my boo in downtown Brooklyn to watch the new Chainsaw Man movie, and indeed, animated gore was the perfect prelude (and unfortunate symbology) for the game after. We found a sports bar nearby, and wanting to live up to my reputation as a Devoted Undergraduate Instructor, I resolved to make the bar my office, and accompanied G2 with a side of light-hearted readings on Japanese imperialism across the Pacific. At the top of the ninth, tied at five apiece, I had finished class prep, and hastily wrote out the lesson plan along the margins of the back page, because I had forgotten my notebooks, and for some reason, it felt like bad juju to dig through my bag when, at any moment, the Jays or the Dodgers could win the game by some complete fluke. But the boo had fallen asleep in the bar booth, and I knew it was time to go, because we had to Go To Work the next day, but not before she snapped this live react, somewhere between the top of the tenth and the bottom of the twelfth: In between stretches of subway tunnel, I refreshed my ESPN app frantically, trying to follow along. (Incidentally, we agree that the MLB interface of the app is the best one, far superior to the cluster—- that is the NBA page’s nonsensical statistical spreadsheet.) Up the steps of all five floors of our walkup, I played the live audio off my phone. By the top step, my New York BBL was fully engaged, but my brain was complete mush. The boo suggested (very strongly) that I not stay up too late, because I had to teach both lectures the next day, with meetings and a dissertation prospectus defense in between. Naturally, I did not listen to her, and I lay in bed watching the game on my phone, and occasionally texting Karen, because in the stupor of the sixteenth inning, somewhere between 2 and 2:30am, who else would understand the maniacal delirium than my dear friend across the continent? Alas, when Freddie, my fellow Canadian, murdered his country with a walk-off, I sent that farewell text, and like Stewie from Family Guy, turned over in my blanket, and there was a non-zero chance that I let out a tiny sob. AdL: At this point, my work wardrobe was designed around all my Jays merch. The boo offered to wash my jersey that night, and I almost accepted because it was getting kinda dank, but we reminded ourselves of the preeminent value of ritual, and left it sufficiently grimy. My senior colleague, who was the chair of the dissertation prospectus defense I attended that afternoon, stared his impenetrable stare at my outfit, and I was concerned that he might have been a hostile die-hard Dodgers fan. Then I remembered that he had just come out with a book about suburbanization in his Pennsylvanian hometown. That relief was confirmed after we wrapped up our student’s defense (which was, unsurprisingly, quite stellar), and he asked how I was feeling about the series, and insisted that the Jays were destined to win, because billion-dollar payrolls were bound to crash and burn. “I can’t stand the Dodgers!” he proclaimed, and I gave him a thumbs-up and a forced smile, because like the former theater kid I was, my superstitious ass couldn’t shake the bad vibes from anything other than a break a leg. “Good luck tonight!” My students, fortunately, were also cheering for my home team, but more out of a commitment to anti-Dodgerism (there were, predictably, many Yankees fans who still couldn’t get over how badly we rocked their shit during the ALDS), and less out of support for Toronto. But one of my students, from the potato-rich province of Prince Edward Island, offered generous solidarity as a fellow Canadian passport-holder. I expected that this would tide over the foreboding misfortune that came with the copious well wishes, and I welcomed his cheers wholeheartedly. For some reason, I can’t remember the game, probably because I spent the entire time ranting to the boo about my evening class, which was, admittedly, not my best work. I was trying to teach a brief history of American colonialism in the Philippines, but couldn’t get my head out of how utterly exhausted I was after eighteen innings of head-on-wall-banging baseball. The photo evidence of that day I do have, though, was that, despite all odds, I somehow managed to produce a banger of a whiteboard: Cue the anime guy looking at a butterfly meme: Is this…professor-ing? KT: I can barely remember G4. I was driving home from campus when the game began, feeling hopeful but depleted, knowing Shohei would take the bump after hitting two homers and four extra base hits, and reaching base a grand total of nine times less than 24 hours earlier. I was gobsmacked that Will Smith was catching again after his thighs of steel held it down behind the dish all 18 innings the night before. Adrian and I exchanged pleasantries throughout the day. I sent a laugh/cry emoji to the meme he posted of a fat Blue Jay bird labeled “Alejandro Kirk.” We talked about what positions we played when we were kids (I was a catcher; Adrian played third). The Dodgers opened the scoring early after Mr. Kiktober, Kiké Hernandez hit a sac fly to make it 1-0 in the first. Then Shohei was bested by Vlad in the top of the 3rd: junior dinged a 2-run, 395 foot homer over the left-centerfield wall. Despite some shakiness, Shohei pitched a decent game that kept us competitive at a score of 2-1 heading into the top of the 7th. My liver couldn’t handle the magic mezcal regimen after G2, so I sipped bitters and soda hoping it might still summon some offensive pop from the boys in (Dodger) blue. I cooked another meal using the same spice blend for the chops in G2. All of this was to no avail. The magic was gone. In a fit of desperation I relented to more alcohol, but with less booze-by-volume: Madre “Desert Water” seltzers. I texted furiously with Chelsea, Nick, Oliver and whoever else would listen to me to no avail. I turned on the Joe Bros “I Can’t Lose.” Turns out we can. Another disastrous torrent of Toronto runs against our frail bullpen made it 6-1 entering the final third of the game. We eked out one more run, making the final score 6-2. All my now unlucky clothes were again tossed into the laundry for another hard reboot. I couldn’t even muster up a congratulatory message to Adrian, before trying to “eternal sunshine” the ick that just happened at Dodger Stadium from my mind. Speedy Berkofsky Glowers at Dodger Stadium AdL: I started the day at the dermatologist’s clinic, after an evening of relief over my team’s victory, followed by an anxiety-laden Google search for the symptoms of skin cancer, and a frantic self-inspection, and I grew concerned over a dark spot on my left leg that, by midnight, I was convinced was melanoma. (WebMD really messes you up.) After the doctor’s good news (that mark on my leg was literally just hardened skin that developed from me picking at a mole), I was on the verge of tears, and walked south to Manhattan’s Koreatown to find something good to eat. On 30th Street, I came across a place called Okdongsik, a hole-in-the-wall with room only for bar seats, and their slim menu drew me in. One of the cooks behind the counter motioned me over to the end of the table, first to serve me a bowl of dweji-gomtang (a clear soup with slices of pork atop a pillow of rice porridge), and then to talk shop about the World Series. Fortunately for me, he was sporting a blue and orange Mets hat. He assured me that the Jays would win tonight, because as good as Shohei was, the Dodgers were built for high-variance home runs, and my own team’s terrifying offense – “The Jays play baseball right, and your guys work the count” – was far more sustainable in the long run. Later that evening, the boo and I went on an IKEA run in Red Hook, and I was on a mission to drive her to madness with my incessant name-brand puns (“If the Jays lose the series, what do you think they…LACK?”), and after a quick dinner of Swedish meatballs and gravlax, we took the bus back to downtown Brooklyn to get on the train home. This was a mistake: our bus got stuck behind some asshole van driver who parked his vehicle in the middle of the street – during rush hour – and I was coming down with a bout of motion sickness, exacerbated by the fear that we’d miss a fat chunk of the game. Thankfully, we got home just in time for the middle of the first. We sat down on the couch, and turned on (puke) Fox One, and were treated to a pair of homers, first from Davis “Beautiful Stache” Schneider, and the second from Vladdy Jr. The candles (and other flammable organics) were lit, the barley tea was poured, and we were locked TF in. Stepping up to the mound was my beautiful White American son (no relation), Trey THEE Savage. And as the sports history books will surely write one day, this was to be the apex of his unlikely rise, but no one could have anticipated exactly how historic it’d be: twelve strikeouts with zero walks, the most in a World Series not only by a rookie pitcher, but by any pitcher ever. No one except for me, his proud Filipino dad (no relation), who spent the entire game blessing him with some sage, knew this would happen, so I’d like to think that I had an important role to play: KT: For the first time since the Dodgers returned to L.A, I was home when the game started at 5pm Pacific. I decided to bust out of my routine a little bit, hoping that the slightest rearrangements to the material world might help jumpstart our anemic offense. I re-established my mise-en-place on the kitchen counter: limes from the backyard, Madre Espladin, Tajin. The Los Angeles Athletic Club cocktail tumbler I used to sip my beverages during the Dodgers’ half of each inning was ready for use. I even purchased some new snacks from the Filipino mega-grocery, Island Pacific Market, including garlic-flavored “cornnick” (basically corn nuts with crispy slivers of garlic mixed in), vinegar-and-garlic-flavored chicharron, and a bunch of other stuff chock-full of palm oil that I have no business eating or drinking because of my chronic health conditions. As I was acquiring my bounty at the market, I was struck with the fear that busting out the Pinoy goods might actually backfire and help out Adrian instead of me… It turns out I was right: the game started with Blake Snell tossing two back-to-back meatballs to Schneider and Vladdy to put us down early 0-2. Snellzilla’s mojo from his earlier playoff run was gone. Our stanky (pejorative) bullpen would have to ride again tonight. Meanwhile, it was Trey Yesevage’s night for Toronto. The Jays’ Cinderella story pitched flawlessly, giving up only one home run to (who else), Kiké Hernandez. Otherwise, we whiffed a total of 12 times, and Yesavage set the World Series rookie record for strikeouts. We went down 6-1 with the great Sandy Koufax watching. He was presumably there to see the GOAT, Clayton Kershaw toss his final innings at Dodger Stadium, a scenario that would’ve only been possible if the score line was reversed. Beneath the shadow of another loss, Kersh lingered on the field with his family soaking it all in before the whole team went back to Toronto down 2-3 with their backs against the wall, fighting to live another day. Another team stalwart loitered after everybody was gone in the dugout: Miguel “Miggy” Rojas stared off into an empty stadium looking forlorn. Maybe it was the competitive anguish in his eyes, but I knew then that Miggy–a clubhouse leader beloved by the Dodger faithful, if relatively unknown amongst casual WS watchers–might just be our only hope. KT: Backs against the wall. Do or die. On Halloween no less. I was up early, because I had to bring my wife Sarah in for a routine medical procedure at 6:30am Pacific. All the nurses, docs, anesthesiologists, and other patients were chattering about what might happen in G6 and a potential G7. One doctor even went so far as to say he was considering canceling his birthday dinner reservation at Hippo in Highland Park the following night if game seven came to fruition. A baseball fan’s superstitions, especially when their team is facing elimination, carry the same potency, and demand the same fastidiousness as a religious zealot’s rites. My spouse understood this and was kind enough to let me drag her around town as “the good drugs” wore off to re-stock my ceremonial essentials: Madre Espladin, a particular brand and flavor of potato chip which we ran out of at the end of G3, and a magic item I hadn’t considered to incorporate since Yamamoto’s last victorious start in G2: oranges. Clearly the backyard limes weren’t doing their thing. I also opted for new vestments, and wore my “L.A. Strong” wildlife relief tee. I’m ashamed to admit that most of L.A. had more confidence in Yoshi’s capacity to redeem us than I. Wasn’t he sick of doing all the work for the group project? How fresh could he be after another complete game within less than a week? I prayed to a god I’d long ago alienated that the oranges would work. He and the Jays’ starter Kevin Gausman carried on much as they did during their first head-to-head battle in G2, keeping it scoreless on both sides through three. I observantly replenished my three orange slices each inning and scurried away every time we pitched, keeping track of the game through its ambient sounds from the other room, while refreshing my MLB app nonstop for live updates that were about 30 seconds ahead of the TV feed in the other room. As my therapist and I have discussed, baseball superstitions provide a convenient screen for a person’s obsessive compulsive tendencies. Mine have worsened through each passing postseason, and I can’t help but wonder if the Catholicism I was conditioned to observe with greater reverence hasn’t somehow been reanimated in all the practices I’ve taken up on behalf of Dodger baseball. The boys finally pushed through in the top of the 3rd with RBIs from Will Smith and the sleeping giant, Mookie Betts, who admitted after G5 that he had been “terrible” all series long. With a small lead, Saint Yoshi went back to work, but it wasn’t long before the devil himself, George Springer brought in the Blue Jays’ first run with a single in the bottom of the 3rd. At this point I had to clean out all the oranges accumulating in my L.A. Athletic Club cocktail tumbler, but wondered desperately if I might be cursing us in the process. After getting out of a jam in the 6th, Yoshi left the game for our bullpen to finish, leaving me scant hope for a game seven. I missed the dawgs of last year’s pen, the true MVPs, when we had no starting pitching to speak of other than a less polished Yoshi, and the hot L.A.-born himbeaux, Jack Flaherty, borrowed for a year from the Detroit Tigers. Throughout G6, Miggy Ro’made a couple of spectacular defensive plays at second base, including a barehander to first in the bottom of the 7th to keep the Jays’ rolling offense at bay. Justin “Wrobo” Wrobleski kept things clean from the bullpen and handed it over to Roki Sasaki, the Japanese wunderkind who the Dodgers signed as a rookie starter, but who ended up flourishing in the postseason as a closer. “Bailalo Roki” (as Miggy Ro’ nicknamed him after DJ Roderick’s “Bailalo Rocky”), worked his way out of a jam in the 8th, only to hit Alejandro Kirk by a pitch to send a runner on base in the bottom of the 9th. Kirk was taken out of the game for a swifter pinch runner, Myles Straw. Addison Barger, the same guy who staked Dodger hearts with a pinch hit grand slam in G1 came to the plate and hit a towering fly into center field over Justin Dean’s head. That hit, likely a double or even a triple, would’ve tied the game with no outs, putting Barger in scoring position to win it all for the Jays. As if commanded by the (Dodger) baseball gods, the ball simply dropped dead into the padding of the Rogers Centre outfield. Dean flung his hands up into the air to signal the umps for a dead ball. The home field advantage that was supposed to bring the Blue Jays their first title in thirty-two years pulled some Freaky Friday, Halloween, “Fall of the House of Usher” type shit with the Rogers Centre’s padding. The wedged ball was an automatic ground-rule double, freezing the runners at 2nd and 3rd with no outs, and keeping the score locked at 3-1 Dodgers. Tyler Glasnow, the presumptive starter for a possible G7, came in for young Roki, as all of Los Angeles collectively girded its loins. The next Jays batter, the red hot Ernie Clement, hit an infield pop up on Glasnow’s first pitch securing at least one measly out. Andres Gimenez took his place in the batters box with the Dodgers’ most loathed, George Springer looming on deck. Gimenez flared what looked to be a bloop single towards shallow left field when Mr. Enrique Hernandez, our October trickster, came charging in from nowhere to make the grab, following-through with a swift, targeted throw to Miguel Rojas for a game-ending double play. I saw none of this and only heard it, of course, since I was hunched over anxiously in the other room observing the sequestration demanded by this year’s liturgy for the World Series. In so doing, we were granted another day. Amen to that. AdL: Drake just had to ruin everything, didn’t he? After my beautiful White American Son (no relation) struck Shohei out in G5, Toronto’s National Disgrace decided to troll the greatest baseball player of all time (and I say that with zero irony) with a couple of dumbass Instagram stories. And this, my friends, is when I first had an inkling that we might lose the World Series: Instead of dwelling on the disastrous double play (and the doubly emphatic primal screams) at the end of the game, and instead of talking about the fact that I spent a good chunk of the game explaining the intricacies of the Jays’ and the Dodgers’ shades of blue to an Australian acquaintance, allow me to talk shit about Drake. I’m the kind of kid from Toronto that has an encyclopedic knowledge of the first half of Drake’s discography, but not the second half, when he decided he’d levitate away from the city’s potholed streets and perch himself atop the former tallest freestanding structure in the world. This included his unreleased tracks on YouTube, those urban anthems with the gritty circulatory undercurrent of a mixtape, as well as the features that he scattered to the winds (his early collabs with now-enemies Kendrick Lamar and Rick Ross were notable masterpieces). To put it in local geography: everything before and up to the album on the left (If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late) is music you can listen to while napping on the late night bus to Scarborough after a line-cook shift downtown, or bump windows-down from a late night drive in your 1997 Honda Civic after a break-up with your situationship. Everything from and after the album on the right (Views), after the first three tracks, is down right unlistenable for anyone not a regular at a bottle-service-only club on King Street West (for my Angelenos, this is a street with the manicured aesthetics of the Arts District but the diversity and energy of the Venice Erewhon). This drop-off was unfortunate, because while Drake’s stocks plateaued (as he shifted towards maximizing Spotify streams instead of crafting albums), Toronto sports skyrocketed to their eminent place today. The spring after Drake released If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, the Raptors repeated as Atlantic Conference champions for the first time in team history, and later that fall, the Blue Jays flipped bats and took names all the way to the ALCS. It was with some personal trepidation, then, that when the Raptors were to face (and beat) the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals in 2019, I had to watch Drake take credit (in the Royal We) for momentum that was far greater than he. For a solid year after Mr. Kendrick Lamar vivisected his middle-class Canadian counterpart, I was questioned about my feelings on the Kendrick-Drake “beef” (which was really a slaughter). Toronto’s beloved sports alumni, Angelenos first (like Demar DeRozan, more loved than Drake would ever be in the city) snubbed the metropolis’s most eminent washed rapper. When Drake laid low for a while, and started teasing snippets from his yet-to-be-released album over the summer, the chatter seemed to die down. But by October, when it became clear that the Jays were to go head to head with the Dodgers, I thought: here we go again! All I wanted was for the guy to keep his cursed social media thumbs off the Jays. By G6, it was clear that Aubrey had lost his touch. One might blame it on Kendrick’s clinical dissection of an October Scorpio (I’m a November Scorpio, we don’t claim him), but at the end of the day, like the Rogers Centre’s walls that wedged the ball into themselves, it was Mr. Graham who was his own worst enemy, and the thorn in Toronto’s foot. KT: As I mentioned earlier, part of me (all of me?) never got over G7 in 2017 against the Astros. One of the things I did wrong that day–as if it had anything to do with me–was schedule a huge campus event on the TV show UnReal. That event ended with the saddest stream of texts, and a drive back to Echo Park through an abject eerie silence, when I’d hoped to be dodging fireworks and crowds streaming onto Alvarado Blvd from all corners. Cut to 2025, and my calendar was clear except for a BBQ earlier in the day at my friend and colleague Natalia Molina’s place in South Pasadena. Natalia grew up in Echo Park (her family still lives here), and their Dodgers fandom is beautifully chronicled in several pieces Natalia has written, including one on this year’s series amidst the ICE raids and bifurcated feelings of its fans: a love for the team and the city vs. our vitriol for its primary owner, Mark Walter, who has investments in ICE detention centers. Most of us were wearing Dodgers gear as we supped on the tri-tip Ian, Natlia’s husband, made special for the day. I was made painfully aware of the fact that my wildfire relief “L.A. Strong” tee signified differently in that neighborhood, where so many homes were lost or damaged in January. Los Angeles had been besieged by both fire and ICE in 2025. Would we make it to the other side of all that to experience the balm of a much-needed win? Even though I packed a little tote to bring to Natalia’s in case I wanted to stay and watch the game (with a tub of sliced oranges, Madre Espladin, the lucky potato chips, and a complete outfit change into a Japanese Dodgers tee and Aussie pajama pants that acquired some magic late into G6), I decided I needed to be in the comfort of my own home for whatever chaos might come. I also wasn’t sure I wanted to expose a beloved colleague to the true bonkersness of my game-watching routines. We dashed home and got settled in time to watch “dead arm” Scherzer give up a hit to Shohei which yielded nothing. My G7 traumas were reactivated when Springer clocked a solid single off Shohei, who was starting again on very short rest (just 3 days). Sho somehow got out of the inning not only by striking-out Vlad with a 100 mph fastball across the plate (Vlad clocked a pitch like that for his 2-run homer against Shohei in G3), but by virtue of Will Smith’s head’s up double-play, that took advantage of Springer’s deliciously bad base-running error. Shohei looked sweaty and spent, but he managed mightily through the first two innings without giving up any runs. I was convinced this was contingent on the miracle of Yoshi’s oranges, which I kept in my own G7 lineup. By the bottom of the 3rd, however, he surrendered a three run no-doubter to Bo Bichette, the Blue Jays’ wounded hero (I miss his Jesus hair and beard), whose contract is up at the end of the year. At that point I was still sequestered in the other room, listening to the ambient sounds of Rogers Centre crescendoing with the taste of victory on the tip of their tongues. My body slumped backwards into a “Death of Chatterton” pose. I was studiously avoiding any communication with Adrian or peeping on social media. Instead, I texted anxiously with the Berkfoskys, Rhys Ernst, Oliver Wang and others. I decided a kind of ascetic, sectarian approach to stimulation from the outside world was the only way to approach this most volatile of scenarios. Baseball is a long game, as G3 and this epic tome we’ve written, remind us. By the top of the 4th, the Dodgers managed to take one back. By the bottom of the 4th, the benches and Dodgers’ bullpen cleared as “Wrobo” dinged Gimenez who (I still insist) dangled his hand in the zone on purpose in the previous sequence. After the dust settled with two on and two out in the bottom of the 4th, the Dodgers activated their starting rotation from the bullpen and sent Glasnow in to continue the game, despite having pitched in relief the night before. There was action on the bases every inning. Dead arm Scherer was pulled in the top of the 5th, and by the top of the 6th the Dodgers narrowed it to a 1-run game on a Tommy Edman sac fly. By the bottom of the 6th, the Jays stretched the lead back up to 4-2. Covered in chip crumbs, and reeking of Madre Espladin muddled with freshly squeezed oranges, I realized I hadn’t eaten any dinner. It didn’t matter. I persevered and continued my rituals. At one point I considered busting out the wood rosary I bought at Quiapo cathedral in Manila in 2016. I finally peeked at social media, and I noticed Adrian was also silent. I wondered where he was watching and how he might be doing. I envied the position he and his team were in, with a two run lead and only a handful of outs left to go. For some reason I toggled over into a strange sense of calm. Is this what they mean by “letting go?” Is this the sensation of one’s soul leaving one’s body? Or was it simply my mezcal-ravaged, nutrition-deprived frame, lapsing into a state of homeostatic survival? We reached the top of the 8th with Trey Yesavage in relief for the Jays. The thing I love about game sevens is that teams are forced to empty out their dugouts and bullpens. There’s no hoarding the talent, and the fans are treated to ace starters in relief, and the utility heroes known only to their respective hives coming in to fulfill their specialty roles. Joe Davis and John Smoltz wondered aloud about Yesavage still working when the real Mad Max, aka that Funky Muncy, clobbered a solo home run to bring us within one. I YAWWWWWWPED and sent the foster kitties scurrying into safe spaces under beds and sofas. At this juncture, Sarah was on her way home from a friend’s art opening with a couple of other pals in tow. “Do you need anything?” she asked via text. “We need more oranges,” I replied, forgetting about real food because I was newly feasting on hope. Emmet Sheehan and Blake Snell came through by holding it down on the mound in the bottom half of the 8th, then in the flash of an instant we were down to only two at-bats left in our season at the top of the 9th. Miggy Ro’ was batting in the 9-spot with one out and nobody on. Miggy worked the count to 3-2 against Hoffman. Hoffman threw a hanging slider, and Mr. Miguel Elias Rojas Naidenoff (where did that last name come from anyway?) sent it over the left field wall into the glove of a Jays fan holding a Canadian flag. The most cursed of souvenirs, courtesy of Los Angeles. The game was tied at 4-4. I hate to be THAT guy, but I always knew it would be Miggy Ro’. This was the same Miggy Ro’ who held onto Kiké’s throw at the end of G6 to turn the double play that sent us to G7. This was the same guy whose defensive prowess got us out of multiple jams through G7; the same guy who lingered in the dugout after we pooed the scrooch in G5, contemplating if his career with the Dodgers wouldn’t end with a giant, ignominious “L.” Miguel Rojas is also a Venezuelan player whose family members weren’t granted visas to watch him play, because of the United States’ fucked up immigration policies and travel restrictions. In other words, the man had STAKES, and he did what so many hard-working unsung immigrants do and lifted us off the mat to give us a fighting chance with his most unlikely and unbelievable blast of destiny. With our holy trinity of Shohei, Freddie and Mookie failing to tack on insurance runs, we headed to the bottom of the 9th with Blake Snell still on the mound. Dave Roberts made another key substitution in the home half of the 9th: Our Cuban outfielder, Andy Pages was sent into center field for his rocket arm. Pages also shares Miggy’s predicament insofar as no one from his family other than his wife has been granted a visa to see him play in a Dodgers uniform. The bottom of the 9th felt dangerous AF with the heart of the Blue Jays line-up due: Vladdy, Bo Bichette, and grand slam Addison Barger (the name of Adrian’s future spawn). Vladdy popped out, and Bichette knocked a single to left. With Barger working a walk to put runners on first and second, Snell was pulled from the game. Yoshinobu Yamamoto emerged from the dugout a mere 24 hours or so after he saved our skins with a 96 pitch, 6-inning performance. Yoshi hit Kirk with a pitch to load the bases with only one out. Varsho flared a ball to Miggy Ro’ (of course) who threw a laser to Will Smith at home despite falling backwards. Kiner-Falefa, who represented the World Series winning run, was forced out at home. The call withstood a review showing Will Smith’s foot barely tapping the plate before IKF’s foot crossed the threshold. I was having an out of body experience, and I decided to throw all caution to the wind. I abandoned my sequestration and began to watch in earnest as Sarah returned home with some shrimp fried rice, and our friends Fonz and Sabsi. Yoshi and the Dodgers were not out of the woods yet with two outs and the bases loaded. The Blue Jays’ winning run remained a mere 90 feet away when Ernie Clement came up to bat and hit a soaring fly ball over Kiké’s head. Oh shit. That was it… Then Andy Pages barreled over from out of nowhere. He knocked Kiké out cold and made an unbelievable grab to send game seven to extra innings. It looked like we’d be riding Yoshi’s back the whole way: whether it was into the abyss, or off into the sunset remained to be seen. Miracles kept accruing in extras, not at the hands of our MVP $uper$tars, but through the pluck and hustle of our immigrant utility players like Rojas and Pages. Wobbly and surfeit of shrimp fried rice after 10-innings of lucky mezcal sips, I lit some incensio de Santa Fe I restocked from Stories Bookstore in Echo Park–another ritual I haven’t even bothered to mention–right before Will Smith came up to bat in the top of the 11th against Shane Bieber. With the count at 2-0, Smith (who I’ve affectionately called a “zygote” for his baby-faced, nay, fetal features), went YARD on a two-seam slider from the Biebs. Cue Justin’s “Sorry.” We heard Echo Park roar through our windows. A few fireworks prematurely popped off. We still had to get through the bottom half of the 11th. Vlad, first up, doubled off Yoshi and was sac-bunted over to third, bringing the tying run 90 feet away with only one out. Yoshi walked Barger, leaving runs on the corners with only 1 out. Then Alejandro Kirk came up to bat: the same thiccc Blue Jay Adrian and I spoke sweetly of earlier in the series. I found it hard not to root for him, even as I wanted–needed–our team to cross the threshold into dynastic glory so that Yankees and Giants fans would finally STFU about winning three in a single decade (still not gonna happen, but…) Yoshi’s splitter broke Kirk’s bat. The thiccc Jay grounded into a game and series ending double-play fielded by Mookie Betts. I’m pretty sure my soul fled my body long before that, only called back into this mortal coil when massive fireworks erupted next door and across the city, as car horns announced our back-to-back victory. According to my friends, I made humping gestures at the TV (a la Kiké’s 2024 celebration) and spewed a tirade of joyous profanities into the phone when my World Series text circle FaceTimed to celebrate. Deliriously HYPED w/ my friend Fonz at the end of G7. My hair is long and crazy because I refused to cut it until the end of the series, a la Kiké, Sho and others. Adrian and I didn’t talk until the next day, when I posted a fish-in-a-barrell meme about how Drake’s presence cost the Jays the World Series. I presented my theory about why the Blue Jays couldn’t close it out ,even after coming home with a 3-2 lead. Ironically, the fact that they came from behind to win the ALCS when they were down 3-2 to the Mariners saddled them with a memento mori. They learned teams could come back from the brink of death. Having done it themselves left that kernel of doubt in their minds, that little fracture in their own faith, when faced with the task of closing it out. I’m certain the Blue Jays will be back in the thick of things at the end of next season. I know it’s been said, and most people don’t mean it, but it truly was a heartbreak for anyone to lose this series which unfurled, as the kids say, as CINEMA. Before I, too, ride off into the sunset singing that Yoshinobu Yamamoto “ace anthem,” it bears acknowledgement that this wild up-and-down season was owed to some very bad karma the Dodgers invited by visiting Trump’s White House (against many of the players’ will), and responding terribly to ICE’s siege of Los Angeles before trying to make up for it with an ambiguous million dollar donation to “support immigrant families.” The excessive trust Doc Roberts placed in our raging MAGA reliever, Blake Treinen (who wrote Charlie Kirk’s name on his hat, and who many Twitter/Bluesky Dodgers fans call “BlaQe” for his Q-Anonish proclivities), made the prospect of our repeat victory in 2025 less palatable for everyone but us diehards. Last year, we had several storylines propelling our victory against the Yankees, who may be the only team more loathed than us at this point. In 2024, our wounded warrior Freddie Freeman, whose kid nearly died, sacrificed his ravaged body for our redemption. This year we were the “American” team playing against all of Canada. The fascist USA didn’t deserve a win, even if the brown people of L.A. could surely use one. As it turns out, a dogfluencer named Air Corgi predicted we would win it in 7, and we did. As I said in a sweet exchange of messages with Canadian Jeopardy superchamp, Mattea Roach the morning of November 1: “I’d be sad if my team lost the World Series, but I wouldn’t be mad if the Blue Jays won.” Part of me can’t fathom going through all of this again next year, though I liken our willful forgetting of baseball’s exquisite anguish to what people say about childbirth. Pressure is a privilege, in the immortal words of Billie Jean King, part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Let’s run it back. Illustration by Yunemo Six (@yunemosix) on Bluesky, inspired by the press pool photo I think of as “Yoshi’s Rebirth” AdL: The first of November began with the following New Yorker interaction: a young cashier and I bickered at the GMC while I was picking up Vitamin B12 and D, and when I dared speculate that the Jays might have a real shot at this (which, let’s be real, they were all around the better team). He bellowed, “BUT HAVE YOU HEARD OF SHOHEI OHTANI?” Yes, kid, I hm and judging from his hat, I realized that he was a salty Yankees fan, still incredulous we’d beaten his team. But he did teach me a valuable lesson. The key to loving a baseball team is to drown oneself in delusions of the future. The Yankee variant of this delulu, though, comes down to some good ol’ Appeal To History, my logical fallacy of choice, and that their team would always have a chance at winning because, well, they have the most World Series wins out of any team in history. To spiritually realign myself before G7, I walked north to a bakery that has, begrudgingly, earned my respect. The day, blustery and sunny in equal measure, seemed to demand the soothing balm of a fifteen-dollar fried chicken sandwich from a Frenchman who decided, in defiance of his stern Taiwanese mother-in-law, to specialize in Asian baked goods. They had just launched their cold-weather replacement for their tomato sando, and I include this work of simple genius below, partly to make you jealous and hungry, my kind reader, but also to index what was probably the best part of an otherwise extremely sad day. I’m not gonna rehash my own play-by-play of G7 because, quite frankly, it still sucks to think about. The boo and I were to head to Park Slope to attend a friend’s birthday, vampire themed (broadly construed, but always already queer), and not realizing that the party had monopolized the patio all the way at the back of the bar, we opted to sit at a booth and stream the game on my phone from the (puke) Fox One app. We kept the stream going even when we discovered that the shindig had been going on for a solid hour, and the celebrant was handing out ‘zines and admiring the Sinners-themed vampire costumes, and we kept the stream going in the short two-minute walk across the street to the sports bar, where we would gather with about a hundred fans to watch the seventh game of one of the greatest World Series in history. Up until the end of Trey Yesavage’s inning, I was an absolute riot. But as the Dodgers crawled back up, I set my phone on Do Not Disturb, and I retreated to the corner with unyielding focus on the screen. And when Yoshi walked up to the mound, my fellow Jays faithful (and many allies) noticed my silence and my praying hands, whispering to some god that I stopped believing in when I was eighteen. Not to get too emo, but I saw in Jeff Hoffmann’s face a look of self-disappointment that I knew too well, and when the Dodgers finally won, I tried not to walk up to the Latino man screaming FUCK CANADA all over the silent bar. Even as we caught the Uber home, which we rode silently back into Manhattan, I still wondered if I should have punched the dude in the face with the force of the 49th parallel. This is the closest I’ve ever felt to anything one might call patriotism. Allegedly, as I was informed the next day, we missed a make-out conga line at the party, but neither of us were in the mood to contract mono regardless of whether or not we were celebrating or grieving. And grieve I did. I was inconsolable that night and all the next day, a modicum of the sorrow of my fellow Torontonians must have felt at home, a mere sliver of a sliver of what must have been running through Vladdy’s mind, as he sat in the bullpen after the game alone. I opened my inbox and noticed that my student from Prince Edward Island wrote to me in support during the game, and on Sunday, I wrote him back: At the time of writing, Shane “The Other” Bieber just exercised his player option. I anticipate that other pieces will fall into place, and that the Jays are going to run it back. I hope that, truly, this is their 2014 San Antonio Spurs moment, and they come back with a surgical vengeance and topple the Heatles Dodgers because, as that GNC cashier taught me, these delusions are the ingredients to the most World Series pennants in history. We’ll catch up one day, Yankees, if the planet doesn’t burn first. My dear Echo Park comrade reminds me that a baseball victory is completely arbitrary, and that is the game’s thrill and tragedy. Decades of growing up with losing sports teams were cured by that 2019 Raptors championship, but in that case, it took the efforts of a disgruntled mercenary who ended up moving to the lesser Los Angeles NBA team (for an allegedly illicit deal) after that championship. I wanted this World Series for the Jays because I wanted it for my city, or what always remains of it, in spite of the influx of monied conservative transplants and the violent xenophobia, in spite of a grifting premier more interested in funneling public funds to his cronies instead of making lives more livable. I wanted the World Series for the Jays because I wanted it for Vladdy, especially his childhood self kicked-out of the diamond by a racist Yankees staffer, and for Yesavage, who hotel-hopped for the opportunity of his lifetime, and for the hilarious possibility of an Addison De Leon, any and all genders, any and all species. And most of all, I wanted this World Series for myself, so that my parents and I could have witnessed a Jays victory together before their bodies gave out. (Incidentally, as someone who rocks with the Dodgers when it’s not in the context of going up against the Jays, I can’t really share the same feelings for Springer, I’m sorry to say.) Baseball, as the literary scholar and former MLB commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti once wrote, breaks your heart; it is designed to break your heart. And if you – the multiple yous, from my friend Karen to our editor Sarah and to our future readers – may permit me a moment, please allow me to riff on the late professor’s words here: The Jays’ season began in spring, at the blossom of Vladdy Jr.’s new 14-year contract, filling the airwaves with our Dominican Canadian’s joy, and then as soon as the frigid Toronto torrents came, they stopped and left me to face the hardest autumn of my life alone. I counted on my team, relied on them to buffer the pain of my ailing parent, to keep the memory of train-hopping hooky and living-room cheers alive, and then, just when the days and elderly lives were at their twilight, when I needed them the most, they lost. Karen Tongson‘s gender is Totino’s Party Pizza. Adrian De Leon is a writer and a shit disturber, which is Canadian for “double Scorpio.” Lead image: Via WikiMedia 2025 World Series Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers New Era 59Fifty caps NEW ERA SHIBUYA 2025年11月10日の渋谷 202511101805 IMG 2150.jpg Related Posts About Avidly Submissions Avidly Reads Short Book Series Los Angeles Review of Books

PHOTO: AFP Published Nov 15, 2025, 09:45 PM Updated Nov 16, 2025, 08:15 PM NEW YORK - The US shutdown has ended, but the hangover is just beginning for investors, who worry gaps in economic data will delay or even derail Federal Reserve rate cuts just as concerns over lofty AI stock valuations have put fresh pressure on companies’ stocks and bonds. Unease drove the heaviest sell-off for the rate-sensitive Nasdaq in a month on Nov 13. The index, which has soared in 2025 with booming AI shares, is down about 4 per cent from October’s peak. Pressure continued in early trade on Nov 14, with blue chip bourses from Tokyo to Paris and London deep in the red, but eased later in the day with the S&P 500 ending slightly lower and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13 per cent. Even gold and Bitcoin were not spared, the latter hitting lows last seen in May. Credit spreads – or the premium over US Treasuries paid by companies to issue bonds in the US market – widened earlier in November. “The market certainly has some froth both in terms of valuations and expectations”, said Mr Michael McGowan, managing director of investment strategy at Pathstone. “I think there’s a healthy scepticism coming into the market and you could certainly see that continue to play out a little more,” he said. The problem is being exacerbated by an information vacuum that ranges from futures positioning to crop estimates and in particular job and price figures, some of which were not collected during the 43 days of shutdown. There is doubt about the publication of October’s inflation data and the employment report for that month will not include the jobless rate, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said, because the household survey from which it is calculated was not conducted. On Nov 14, the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labour Statistics announced they would begin releasing data skipped over during the shutdown starting next week. Employment data for September, which had been scheduled for release on Oct 3, will be published on Nov 20. The gaps in the data matter for markets because Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has likened the situation to “driving in the fog” and flagged that policymakers are likely to “slow down” in response, or in other words hold rather than cut interest rates, after two consecutive cuts in September and October. Mr Tim Horan, chief investment officer of fixed income at Chilton Trust, said: “We were able to see a September cut and an October cut because they felt confident in their direction of travel for inflation... Will they have that confidence at the December meeting with the lack of data points?” Expectations for a 25-basis point rate cut in December, seen as a sure thing a month ago, are down to about 46 per cent, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. “We’ve obviously had a huge rally in the market from the April trough, and it’s pretty much been uninterrupted,” said Mr Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual in Sydney. “(It) requires Fed rate cuts and sustained easy financial conditions to justify what I think are extreme valuations.” The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500, based on earnings estimates for the next 12 months, is currently around 22.8 times, well above its 10-year average of 18.8, according to LSEG Datastream. Together with year-to-date gains above 20 per cent in hard-running sectors such as technology, it also does not take much for investors to want to lock in some gains. Already, the mood has turned fickle and darlings such as Palantir and Oracle have logged losses around 12 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, in November. Chipmaker Nvidia is down 6 per cent. Nvidia’s results next week are critical, given the stock has been at the fore of the record-breaking stock rally in 2025. “We’re at a time of year here where any kind of downside might ripple a little bit further in certain sectors that have really put up big numbers this year, as you’re going to have some trigger fingers to take some profits off the table,” said Mr Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. Meanwhile, Mr Michael Burry’s decision to close his hedge fund Scion Asset Management on Nov 13 added to jitters over frothy AI valuations. He has argued that tech giants pouring billions into Nvidia chips and servers are quietly stretching out depreciation schedules to make earnings look smoother. Valuation concerns spilled over into corporate debt markets, too. Bonds issued by Oracle Corp have taken a hit in recent days as concerns rise over the cloud and AI giant’s huge debt issuance to further fund its AI infrastructure. Hedge funds disclosed their third-quarter positioning on Nov 14 with some showing possible bearishness on tech. Tiger Global Management, the hedge fund founded and led by Mr Chase Coleman, showed it slashed its stake in Facebook parent Meta Platforms. During the shutdown, the data void shot previously little-followed private surveys to prominence and painted a mixed picture of the economy where spending appears to be holding up but, on some measures, layoffs have surged. Investors have struggled to draw conclusions and have stuck with expectations for at least three cuts by the end of 2026 to take rates to about 3 per cent. Analysts say that view is likely to face pressure, especially as a growing number of policymakers are sounding reticent on rate cuts. “The Fed is flying blind as we are,” said Mr Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY in New York.

Title: More than half of low and middle-income Americans now own stocks. Here's why.

The stock market isn’t just for rich people anymore. More than half of low- and middle-income Americans now invest in capital markets, according to new research by the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth, a financial nonprofit. And a majority of those less-affluent investors, with household incomes ranging from $30,000 to $80,000, started investing in the past 5 years. In prior generations, owning stocks often meant you had a broker and a lot of money. Even today, the top 1% of wealthy Americans owns half of all stock, federal data shows. But technological leaps and industry shifts have dramatically lowered the bar for entering the market. Nowadays, just about anyone can buy in. “The entry barriers are lower,” said Timothy Flacke, CEO of Commonwealth. “You can start with 50 dollars or, in many cases, a dollar, and a smartphone. That matters.” Stock tips used to circulate in highbrow finance magazines and subscription newsletters as well as country-club golf courses. Today, anyone with internet access can summon an avalanche of investment advice with a simple Google search. YouTube and TikTok brim with investment influencers. And buying stock has never been easier. Online platforms allow consumers to purchase shares without the aid of brokers or the burden of fees. For the price of a coffee, you can own a piece of the market. “These days, no brokerages charge commissions, and many of them allow for fractional shares,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior retirement adviser and financial planning expert at The Motley Fool. “You can invest as little as 5 dollars, in some cases, and get a portion of a share of Nvidia or Microsoft.” The report from BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth, published Oct. 13, draws from a nationally representative survey of more than 2,750 Americans, all from households with low or moderate incomes. It’s part of a larger initiative to study the flood of new investors into the stock market during the COVID-19 pandemic years. In 2020 and 2021 alone, individual investors opened 46 million new brokerage accounts. The pandemic inspired many Americans to try their hand at investing: They were stuck in their homes, spending less and amassing savings, partly thanks to the federal stimulus effort. “There were some folks who found themselves either with more cash or with more time,” Flacke said. For middle-class Americans, stocks and real estate have served as gateways to the American Dream, rewarding a modest investment with a lifetime of capital gains. In recent years, however, spiraling home prices and rising interest rates have pushed homeownership out of reach for many. The stock market, with no minimum investment, remains a viable alternative for building wealth. “A lot of younger people and a lot of lower-income people have not been able to buy their way into the housing market,” said Caleb Silver, editor-in-chief of the financial journalism site Investopedia. “But they have been able to build their net worth by investing in the stock market, and by owning individual stocks.” As a tool for building wealth, the stock market has done an admirable job of advertising itself. The S&P 500 rose by 261% over the past decade, climbing at an annual rate of 13.6%, according to The Motley Fool. “With a few exceptions, the market has been on an extraordinary tear over the last 10-15 years,” Brokamp said. “That just attracts more attention, and more people invest.” In time, rising stock ownership among lower-income Americans could chip away at historic wealth disparities. In the first quarter of 2025, the bottom 50% of Americans by net worth owned just 1% of all stocks, according to a Motley Fool analysis. With many more lower- and middle-income consumers owning stocks, perhaps their portfolios will eventually grow. “Americans are very good at being consumers,” Silver said. “But they’re also becoming better at being owners, owners of the companies that they’re spending money on.” Lower-income investors have much the same aspirations as higher-income Americans, according to the BlackRock report. Survey respondents cited these as their top investment goals: The survey does not include 401(k) accounts, IRAs and other tax-favored investments. It focuses on consumers investing through standard brokerage accounts. The survey found that newer investors are more likely to own individual stocks, rather than mutual funds or ETFs. That could be a problem. All stocks are volatile, and individual stocks are generally more mercurial than mutual funds and ETFs, which often mirror the performance of a stock or bond index. “My personal preference is for people to start with index funds and then move into individual stocks,” Brokamp said. “But it looks like the opposite is happening now.” The survey suggests new investors “are really hungry for information about how to diversify” their investments, said Claire Chamberlain, President of The BlackRock Foundation. “One of the things the industry can do is meet people where they are.” The financial services industry could help new investors, for example, by encouraging more households to open emergency savings accounts, Chamberlain said. A recent analysis by Investopedia found that the average American family should have at least $35,000 in emergency savings to cover unexpected expenses. Emergency savings deliver financial security. Without savings, a lower-income family is more apt to cash out an investment account if a car breaks down or the roof leaks. “One of the things that this survey revealed is the importance of having emergency savings,” Chamberlain said, “to support the investor’s ability to stay the course.”

Title: Bitcoin mining news: Bitcoin mining stocks Lose $8B, Bitdeer’s datacenter fire, AI delays hit CORZ

It was a rough week across Bitcoin mining and broader tech markets. Bitcoin mining stocks sold off alongside Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and other large-cap names, and hashprice flirted with cycle lows as bitcoin mining difficulty is still sky high. Against that backdrop, companies faced fires, hardware delays, product launches, and a fresh debate over custodial risk in Bitcoin lending. You are reading a recap of The Mining Pod. Watch the full episode on YouTube Mining stocks fell sharply this week as part of a wider tech correction. “Everything is just getting absolutely destroyed right now,” Blockspace Founder Will Foxley said on the most recent Mining Pod, pointing out that bitcoin mining stocks have lost $20 billion in their collective market cap since October. (And they lost $8 billion this past Thursday alone). Hashprice is now hovering just above its all time low, which co-host Colin Harper described as “a clear floor for where the average miner is right now in terms of their operating cost.” Hashprice–a measurement of Bitcoin mining revenue–recently tested around $40 per petahash per day, near its all time low, while network difficulty continues to trend higher, according to Luxor’s Hashrate Index. That combination leaves many pure play miners exposed and increases pressure to secure AI or high performance compute tenants to backfill power contracts. At the same time, the podcast hosts warn that phasing out Bitcoin mining too quickly to chase AI could shock revenue and disappoint equity investors. “If you phase it out too quickly, then you just lose a chunk of revenue,” Harper said, arguing that miners need a careful ramp if they want to keep balance sheets and shareholders intact. Bitdeer’s under construction Ohio site suffered an electrical fire that damaged two of 26 planned buildings after welding sparks ignited equipment inside one of the large metal structures. CEO Jihan Wu said on social media that crews were welding on site when sparks flew into the building and caused the blaze, a costly mistake even if insurance covers much of the loss. The fire hit just as Bitdeer reported weak Q3 earnings, missing expectations on revenue and income, and as Wu skipped the earnings call while traveling to an event in Miami. The company also announced a $400 million convertible note, structured with call spreads to limit dilution but still expected to dilute shareholders by 2 to 4 percent. “Down 45 percent over the last five days, just an absolutely brutal drawdown,” Harper said, adding that Tether dropped some 7.7 million shares of Bitdeer from September to October. Bitcoin backed lending app Lava is under fire after a mandatory September update quietly changed how user funds are held. Lava originally launched as a discrete log contract (DLC)-powered lending platform where users locked Bitcoin into a DLC-based multisig, a model that drew users who wanted self custody and programmatic enforcement of loans. The recent app update prompted users to sign a transaction that moved their BTC from the DLC wallet on their phone to institutional cold storage that on chain sleuthing suggests is with Kraken, although Lava has not confirmed the custodian. Harper said users were told they were moving to a “new vault” but not that this vault used a completely different custodial model, calling it “a really bad look” for a sector already scarred by the fallout of last cycle’s leading crypto loan companies, BlockFi and Celsius. “You seem to have needed to move to a custodial cold storage model to lock lower interest rate credit,” Harper said, “but the way in which you went about it completely obliterated trust.” Auradine, one of the few U.S.-based Bitcoin mining hardware makers, announced its next generation TeraFlux miner. The rig can hit 9.8 joules per terahash in eco mode, in line with current generation machines from Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan according to the hosts. At standard settings it delivers around 310 terahash per second, or 240 terahash per second in eco mode, with efficiency closer to 11 joules per terahash when pushed for more hashrate. Auradine plans air cooled, hydro, and immersion variants, matching the current expectation that vendors ship multiple thermal configurations at launch. “I like to see the unit competitive against other manufacturers,” Mining Pod analyst Matt Kimmel said, adding that broader support for non-Chinese manufacturers would help diversify supply. Private miner NYDIG and its parent Stoneridge continue to scale a vertically integrated mining strategy centered on oil and gas assets. This week, AFE Founder Brandon Davis shared his findings that Stone Ridge is lining up a $2.3 billion dollar acquisition of Eagle Ford, an oil and gas basis in South Texas. The Mining Pod hosts noted that this follows Stone Ridge’s planned purchase of Conoco Phillips assets in Oklahoma, and NYDIG’s pending buy out of Crusoe’s flared gas mining operations. With these moves, Stone Ridge appears to be building a portfolio that combines upstream energy, midstream services, and mining infrastructure under one umbrella. “What Bitcoin mining will survive in the U.S. will be at the energy level,” Harper said, arguing that Stoneridge’s growing oil and gas portfolio gives it a structural edge as other miners scale back. The show closed with a segment on Core Scientific and its key AI client CoreWeave. In a tense CNBC interview, CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator framed delays at certain Core Scientific data centers in Texas and Oklahoma as a temporary construction issue and stressed that customer contracts and revenue are only pushed back by about one quarter. Markets were not convinced: CoreWeave shares are down about 50% from recent highs amid concerns that many “neocloud” providers will miss aggressive build timelines.

Title: BlackRock Launches Expansion Of $2.5 Billion BUIDL Fund Into Binance And BNB Chain

Securitize and Binance have jointly announced on Friday that the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) will now be accepted as off-exchange collateral for trading on Binance. Fortune reported that the collaboration with Binance is expected to boost the popularity of BUIDL, a token launched by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, last year. Since its inception, BUIDL has witnessed significant growth, with its market capitalization exceeding $2.5 billion. Functioning akin to a stablecoin, BUIDL is commonly utilized as collateral for trading cryptocurrency derivatives, catering primarily to large institutional investors like private equity firms and hedge funds that make a minimum investment of $5 million into the BlackRock BUIDL fund. What sets BUIDL apart from traditional stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) is its unique feature of distributing the yield collected from its reserves to investors. Currently offering a yield of around 4%, BlackRock imposes a management fee ranging from 0.2% to 0.5% on the token. To bring BUIDL into existence, BlackRock collaborates with Securitize, a company specializing in issuing digital assets. Securitize’s CEO, Carlos Domingo, highlighted the growing popularity of tokenized assets due to their ability to facilitate quick and efficient trade settlements. Domingo emphasized the “antiquated nature” of current capital market ledgers, often built on outdated software, contrasting this with the “agile and near-instant settlement capabilities” of blockchain technology. Catherine Chen, Binance’s Head of VIP & Institutional, noted that the addition of BUIDL was driven partly by customer demand. She noted in the statement: Integrating BUIDL with our banking triparty partners and our crypto-native custody partner, Ceffu, meets their needs and enables our clients to confidently scale allocation while meeting compliance requirements. Concurrently, BUIDL is set to introduce a new share class on the BNB Chain network, enhancing investor reach and interoperability with other blockchain financial applications. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL marked BlackRock’s inaugural tokenized fund on a public blockchain, tokenized by Securitize, offering qualified investors access to U.S. dollar yields with flexible custody, daily dividend payouts, and seamless peer-to-peer transfers. This integration builds upon BUIDL’s presence across networks like Arbitrum (ARB), Aptos (APT), Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), Polygon (POL), and Solana (SOL), further enhancing its accessibility and utility within the blockchain ecosystem. When writing, Binance’s native token, BNB, trades at $931.60, recording losses exceeding 20% in the past 30 days. This positions Binance Coin 32% below all-time high levels of $1,369 reached back in October of this year.

Title: After Lions tour and last Autumn Nations, Wallabies ‘now well versed with Ireland players’

It’s 7.50am on Friday. The high-pitched whine is an audible reminder of the wind that buffets the doors of the Radisson hotel in Stillorgan, Co Dublin; the slanting rain being the second element in a two-pronged assault. A seagull seeks shelter under an awning. Joe Schmidt bids farewell to a friend in the lobby, stopping briefly for a chat. Australia will soon make the short hop to Blackrock for their Captain’s Run. Upstairs, Wallabies skipper Harry Wilson holds court, an engaging interviewee. There are no Australian journalists present, instead a couple take to the online portal. It’ll be a slow day in every respect, once the on-pitch run-though is over. Coffee and Netflix get a mention, the staples for a team confined to base. Both Wilson and Schmidt mentioned last year’s clash between the countries, a game the Wallabies led until the final eight minutes, when Ireland pilfered a 22-19 win. Andy Farrell’s side have eight survivors in the run-on team, Australia, nine, so there are enough points of difference not to get bogged down by historical reference. Wilson pointed out that between last November’s meeting and the Lions series the Wallabies have become well versed with the Ireland players. Wilson was asked about one of them, Jack Conan. “He’s a really good ball carrier, a strong ball carrier, which you definitely felt during that Lions series. He’s quite good in the lineout too, got a good jump on him, so I think he’ll definitely help their lineout,” he said. “When you have a player like Caelan Doris move to seven, they’re going to have a lot of good ball carriers in their backrow. That’s a really big point for us where our backrow is going to have to step up and try and stop them there because they’ve obviously picked quite a big one. But I think it’s always exciting when you get to go up against three quality backrows.” Three kilometres down the road at the Aviva Stadium it was a case of “right back at you” as Caelan Doris, the Ireland captain, was asked about the Aussie loose trio and in particular the indefatigable Fraser McReight. “Set piece is a big focus area,” Doris said. “Scrum and lineout, how we show up there. Breakdown-wise, I’m obviously playing seven [and] up against McReight, who’s been world-class over the last couple of years. I think he was top poacher in the Rugby Championship and contests a ton of balls. So, breakdown is going to be a big point. “He’s [McReight] extremely fit. His work-rate is almost unparalleled. We saw a clip of him, I think it was the 76th minute of a game a few weeks back. He makes a tackle, gets off the ground, chases, gets on the end of a ball and scores a try. His stats each game are very high. “He has got a good skill set as well, he’s a good footballer and has the ability to play the ball off the line. He’s not the biggest guy, but he carries pretty strongly as well. The standout thing is his work rate.” Doris is unfazed by swapping his traditional role at eight for a crack at openside flanker. He will continue to try to cause chaos at the breakdown. “The first breakdown battle off scrums and lineouts is going to be a difference. Up against McReight, it’s going to be one that I’m looking forward to and need to get right,” he said. There is a sense that both Ireland and Australia are trying to wriggle out from underneath a blanket of criticism in some quarters that decries a level of recent underperformance. The Wallabies are suffering legacy disappointment from Udine and the 26-19 defeat to Italy; Ireland from the 13-26 defeat to the All Blacks in Chicago and a failure to blossom in the opening 40-minutes against Japan. Australia are looking for energy to sustain them through the penultimate game of a long season and better discipline in a broad sense; Ireland for improved accuracy at the set piece and in handling. It’s what is missing rather than what’s there that’s generated the greater angst outside of the respective camps. The final word to Doris. “The World Cup rankings are done in December, so from that point of view it’s massively important but also in terms of continuing the belief and improvement. [To get the result] it’s got to be process-focused, performance-focused, so that is what we are putting our minds towards. It’s the consistency defensively and in what we’re doing in attack that needs to improve this weekend.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: AIL preview: Big Leinster names to feature in Dublin 6W derby face off

Like never before, the Dublin 6W derby has more than just local bragging rights at stake, as second-placed Terenure College host St Mary’s College at Lakelands Park (kick off 3pm) in an Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A summit meeting. St Mary’s arrive with five wins out of five, and 23 points out of a possible 25, while Terenure have won four of their five games to lie second on 21 points. Supporters of both came from far and wide last season when the clubs traded home wins in front of huge crowds for their first AIL derbies in seven years after St Mary’s returned to the top flight. Although some big Leinster names are among those featuring in this full programme of matches – weather permitting – the pity is that Terenure’s brilliant young halfbacks, Fintan Gunne and Caspar Gabriel, were not released. They were central figures to a third successive bonus point when beating high-flying Ballynahinch 52-12 away a fortnight ago. But they have a plethora of skilful, versatile backs and Carlos Spencer moves former Leinster back Chris Cosgrave, who scored a hat-trick in Ballynahinch, to outhalf. Caolan Cooley comes in at left wing, Kiwi scrumhalf Griffin Culver returns, while Leinster have released hooker John McKee, with Oisín McCormack, Max Russell and returning captain Luke Clohessy forming a new backrow. St Mary’s have been boosted by the fitness of their captain/playmaker Conor Dean, injured in their 27-26 win over Con last time, while Mark McHugh brings in winger Aaron O’Sullivan, scrumhalf Colm Reilly and tighthead Mick McCormack as former Munster centre Dan Goggin continues at number eight. Reigning champions Clontarf sit third and travel to Cork Con in a repeat of last season’s final, with the home side in serious need of a win after three successive defeats. ‘Tarf welcome back Dylan O’Grady, Hugh Cooney and Alan Spicer. [ Joe Schmidt back on familiar ground as Wallabies face Ireland in DublinOpens in new window ] Lansdowne, in fourth, renew their age-old rivalry with Old Belvedere in Ollie Campbell Park, with Declan Fassbender’s one change from the side which beat Nenagh 62-17 being a notable one with Leinster’s Max Deegan in at number eight. Belvo make four changes, including Daragh O’Dywer at outhalf. UCD welcome Young Munster, with Andrew Osborne at fullback, while the Cookies welcomes Munster trio Shay McCarthy and halfbacks Tony Butler and Jake O’Riordan. Promoted Nenagh Ormond, still winless, host Ballynahinch after contrasting Bateman Cup outings, the latter’s ruthless 78-0 win over Sligo regaining them momentum. Among the home side’s five changes, Charlie O’Doherty start at 10 and captain Kevin O’Flaherty returns at lock. Remarkably, there are also summit meeting in 1B, where leaders Old Wesley host a resurgent Trinity; in 2A when unbeaten Barnhall travel to Dungannon; in 2B where UL Bohs host Galwegians as the only two unbeaten sides and completing a double header in UL at 5pm, there is an identical match-up in the women’s division between UL Bohs, seeking a third successive title, and surprise leaders Galwegians. Division 1A: Cork Constitution v Clontarf, Temple Hill; Nenagh Ormond v Ballynahinch, New Ormond Park; Old Belvedere v Lansdowne, Ollie Campbell Park; UCD v Young Munster, Belfield; Terenure College v St. Mary’s College, Lakelands Park, 3pm (IrishRugby+). Division 1B: City of Armagh v Garryowen, Palace Grounds; Instonians v Highfield, Shaw’s Bridge; Naas v Blackrock College, Forenaughts; Old Wesley v Dublin University, Energia Park; UCC v Queen’s, The Mardyke, 3pm.

Title: Tadhg Beirne: ‘There’s so much more in us - we’re a far cry away from our potential at the moment’

Tadhg Beirne tells a story about Johann van Graan replacing him around the hour mark back in his second season with Munster. Beirne had arrived in Munster in 2016, and Van Graan a year later. They were still getting to know each other and the Monday after replacing him, the coach was about to learn more about Beirne. “I went into his office,” recalls Beirne, “and I was like: ‘Why did you take me off?’ And he was like: ‘I just felt you looked like you needed to come off.’ And I was like: ‘Yeah? I feel like I’m an 80-minute player’.” From that day on, Beirne became one of Van Graan’s 80-minute men. Last season, Beirne completed 80 minutes in all bar one of his 16 starts for Munster, when coming off for the last three minutes away to Ulster. Ditto in his nine starts as an ever-present for Ireland, save for a HIA against Scotland. On the Lions tour he played every minutes of the Tests, after which he was voted player of the series, and played more minutes than any other member of the squad. In all, Beirne played 2,544 minutes last season. In George Orwell’s Animal Farm, which Beirne read as part of his Leaving Cert back in the day, you suggest he would have to be the horse, aka Boxer. He laughs. Did he ever feel tired? “I think I did at times. But by the time the games come around, you’re okay.” You can understand why van Graan felt compelled to replace him. At times on the pitch – maybe it’s the headgear or the gait – he looks shattered. [ Tadhg Beirne happy to crown ‘season full of ups and downs’ with men’s player of the year nodOpens in new window ] “I feel like, often, towards the end of the game is when I can probably express myself a bit more. I suppose you’re probably watching people around you start to diminish a bit. I never feel so tired that I need to come off. I’m just ‘next play’. I don’t know what it is.” He reveals one extreme example. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt as bad physically as I did after the first Lions Test, and through that whole week. When I got to the Friday, during the captain’s run I was like: ‘Actually this is the worst I’ve felt going into a game’. But then, within the next 24 hours it just got better. The adrenaline kicked in, but that was definitely the worst I’d felt in a long time.” Playing every minute of a Lions’ Test series win made up for being restricted to a combined 16 minutes in two appearances off the bench in a losing series behind closed doors four years earlier. In Australia there was the added bonus of his wife Harriet being there, and were his three sisters, Jennifer, Alannah and Caoimhe (who all lived there at the time) and his parents, Brenda and Gerry. “My older sister’s fiancé was there, younger sister’s boyfriend was there as well, and then I had my aunt and godmother [Fiona] and uncle [Tomás] and their daughter Orla was out as well.” And so too were his cousins Leigh, who lives in Perth, and Cillian. “We are really close, and I’m the only boy, and it’s great for my parents who are retired.” In truth he hasn’t had a day with Ireland or Munster quite like that, but he’s not done yet. The end of a playing career is often related to its beginning. One ventures Johnny Sexton played on until he was 38 in part because he didn’t make his breakthrough with Leinster until he was 23 and with Ireland when he was 24. Similarly, Beirne had played plenty of rugby with the Irish Under-20s and in the AIL, but he was 23 when his career took off with the Scarlets, and 26 when he made his Ireland debut. Last Saturday, Beirne was one of five Ireland players from Kildare in the matchday 23, and in that sense is something of a trailblazer. It’s always been more of a GAA county. “Gaelic and soccer were my two main sports as a kid. Then I tried rugby when I was in fifth class and hated it, so I quit after a month.” All changed when he went to Clongowes. “Rugby was compulsory, so you end up playing, and then you see the senior cup team and all of a sudden you’re in awe.” He had so many sliding doors moments. On leaving school he went into the Leinster system. They’d just created a Bs team which led to two years in the sub-academy with Dave Fagan before three seasons in the full academy. Injuries blighted his three years in the academy, and his lack of bulk. “It was a different game as well. It was very size-orientated and that’s not something I had at the time. I came out of Clongowes at 78kg. If you see pictures of me back then, I’m skin and bone. This morning, I was 120kg!” During his time in the academy, as well as delivering pizza, coaching Blackrock and studying, Beirne played for Lansdowne Under-20s and senior team, with whom he won two AIL medals in 2012-13 and 2014-15, beating Clontarf in both finals, although he was benched for the second one. We just fell short at times, unfortunately. But I’ve enjoyed all my time at Munster “I was on the bench. I didn’t turn up for training the week before the final and Mike Ruddock dropped me.” Was Ruddock right? “Probably, yeah. I was a bit young and dumb. I think I went to the Trinity Ball the night before.” The following season, Leinster opted to sign Ian Nagle and keep Hayden Triggs, thereby releasing Beirne. “I remember walking off the field in UCD on my own knowing it was my last session. It was emotional, just knowing it was done.” As he was doing his master’s, he told his agent that he had to stay in the Pro12 or England. The Scarlets came in for him, he flew to Wales, met Wayne Pivac and accepted the only rugby offer on the table. “They signed me for very little money,” he says, laughing. After two great years there, winning a Pro12 and Pro12 player of the season, Beirne was within one more season of becoming Welsh qualified when Munster stepped in. Having made his international debut at the age of 26 in Australia, he was part of that series win and also the series win in New Zealand in 2023, and the Grand Slam earlier that year when sidelined with an ankle injury for the last three games. “Obviously it was class to be out there,” he says of the St Patrick’s Day coronation after beating England in the Aviva. “But I’m hobbling around. I’m in a [moon]boot.” There was also the Six Nations title in 2024, a host of landmark wins and individual awards, as well as Munster’s 2022-23 URC title and becoming Munster’s captain. Yet, he sounds more driven than ever. Beirne has unfinished business and though he could yet play until he’s 40, not a huge amount of time to do so. Everything [Clayton McMillan] has been doing is brilliant for the squad, giving lads opportunities “Ideally, we could have won a lot more. There’s been ups and downs, and that’s well documented in Munster. The quality of the squads we’ve had, we probably should have achieved a bit more. We just fell short at times, unfortunately. But I’ve enjoyed all my time at Munster. “I thought Johann was incredible when he was in there. At times he got a hard rap for what he did, but in terms of the circumstances and what he was producing, it was very impressive.” Like seemingly all at Munster, Beirne is hugely enthused by the arrival of Clayton McMillan this season. “Last year was a difficult year and I think the freshness that he’s brought in and the way he’s doing things, the way he sees the game, simplifying it in many ways for a lot of players, takes a lot of pressure off them. Everything he’s doing has been brilliant for the squad, giving lads opportunities. It all adds to a happier, healthier squad.” On Saturday evening Beirne comes up against another significantly influential coach in his career in Joe Schmidt, who gave him his debut in 2018. “I feared Joe. I think most people did. Did he make me a better player? Yeah, 100 per cent, because of the detail part. That’s what everyone speaks about, and it’s the same with Faz [Andy Farrell].” Farrell took the team on to another level with that 17-game winning run and the number one ranking. This team have many of the same personnel without quite scaling those heights since, but Beirne maintains: “We’re in a really good place. I think we’re evolving in the right way, in the way we attack and defend. “I think there’s so much more in us and we’re a far cry away from our potential at the moment. I still think we’re one of the best teams in the world for sure. I think we just need to chase it, to go out and prove it.” [ Andy Farrell hits the refresh button hoping to breath new life into IrelandOpens in new window ] And, eh, the lineout malfunctions? “I was calling the lineouts [against Japan], and it was just individual errors all around. The first one was an overthrow. It’s tough, that happens. “And then we proceeded to have two calls when lads misheard the call. It makes the lineout look like a shambles, but they’re the easiest things to fix up. So all of a sudden, I’m trying to be clearer with my voice, so that they don’t mishear me again.” That also happened for the one lineout he called in Soldier Field against the All Blacks before, of course, his third-minute yellow card when Beauden Barrett ran into him was wrongly upgraded into a 20-minute red card, which has been since rescinded. [ Ireland’s unconvincing Japan jobOpens in new window ] “When it happened, I was like: ‘Oh, I felt him on my shoulder there’. I remember saying to the lads in the huddle: ‘I think it’s a penalty. I may end up going off for a yellow card, I don’t know’.” Initially an official told Beirne it would only be a yellow before subsequently confirming that, like all yellow cards, it would go to a bunker review. “It wasn’t until he came up to me probably 30 seconds before I started warming up and he was like: ‘You have a red card.’ I was like: ‘What do you mean?’ It was a bit of a shock.” James Lowe has described the Rugby World Cup in 2027 as his North Star. Is that Beirne’s, or has his eye on a third Lions tour in 2029? “The Lions could be a push but the way I’m feeling I don’t see it [the World Cup] as my North Star now. I see it as the next thing to strive for. I don’t see it as an ending, if you get me. I just see it as the next big competition, especially after the last World Cup, to hopefully right the wrongs of that World Cup.” “It still haunts me,” he admits of that epic 28-24 quarter-final loss to New Zealand, when a 37-phase Irish attack culminated in Wayne Barnes awarding Sam Whitelock a jackal penalty, even though he clearly didn’t release after tackling Rónan Kelleher. “It wasn’t a penalty. Well,” Beirne corrects himself with a smile. “It was a penalty for us.” It would be nice to go back to Australia and create more special memories in front of family and friends in two years’ time? “That’s the goal.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Domhnall Nugent: ‘This guy messaged to say that after I talked about addiction, he went to the GP and it saved his life’

Time Published: 2025-11-15T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
The last time St John’s were in an Antrim county final, Domhnall Nugent went a bit viral. It was 2017 and it was the football final and the first thing to understand about it is that he wasn’t playing for St John’s. Rather, he was in the colours of Belfast rivals Lámh Dearg and neither club had won an Antrim title in the guts of a quarter-century. The second thing to understand is that Nugent was playing against not just some of his best friends and neighbours but also his family. His father Paddy was managing St John’s, his brother Pádraig was in goals. Finally, you must understand that he was 20 years old and he was an alcoholic, with all the chaos and bad decisions that entails. With 10 minutes to go and Lámh Dearg two points up, his brother Pádraig went to take a kick out for St John’s, only for Domhnall to run in and kick the ball away to waste time. It had the desired effect – Pádraig drew out and hit him, earning himself a red card. Domhnall got away with yellow for his messing and Lámh Dearg went on to see out the last 10 minutes against 14 men. He had his 15 minutes of social media infamy in the days that followed. In the eight years since, Domhnall Nugent has been to hell and back. He is six-and-a-half years sober, he has made it back to the Antrim hurling panel and won a Joe McDonagh medal, he is in a solid relationship with his girlfriend Amy and life is good. But it wasn’t until the St John’s hurlers played in the county final last month that he was able to box off that niggling page of the ledger. “I’m not gonna lie,” he says. “Lámh Deargh in 2017 against St John’s was in the middle of my madness. And honestly, there wasn’t one night I went to bed and didn’t think about that from then until the night before the county final a few weeks ago. “Honestly, I had forgiven myself for nearly everything. But not that. And I enjoyed my time with Lámh Dearg and it was good crack and there’s no bad blood or anything. It was just the way it sat for me. “My password on my old Bebo account used to be the 17.03.20 – basically, the 17th of March sometime in the 2020s. It was a way of saying I wanted to someday be in Croke Park on St Patrick’s Day in the club finals. That was always my thing. “So the relief that I got even off getting to a county final with St John’s was unbelievable. And then winning it, that was the first thing that came into my head. I get to celebrate this with everyone that I grew up with.” Nugent is 28 years old now and he is well and in a good place. Davy Fitzgerald is giving him a shot at being one of the goalkeepers on the Antrim panel over the winter, which may or may not work out but he’s up for taking it as far as he can anyway. He is also the current Down camogie manager, exercising a coaching muscle that he has been working on ever since he took a St John’s under-12 team when he was just 15. [ Davy Fitzgerald ‘more guarded’ after criticism over Antrim commentsOpens in new window ] But though he is in the planning stage with all that stuff, the here and now is about the St John’s senior hurlers. In beating Loughgiel a few weeks back, the Belfast club won their first hurling county title in 52 years. They’re more famous as a football club and sit on top of the Antrim roll of honour in the big ball code. But this is only their eighth hurling crown, five of which were won in a 12-year period in the 1960s and 70s. So when it happened, when half a century of nothing finally became something, Nugent threw off his helmet and tried to take it all in. He has a picture in his phone of the first person to reach him to celebrate – his brother Pádraig, fists clenched, mouth roared open. The circle squared. “It was just class,” Domhnall says. “But on the other side of it, a club championship like that is probably number one in most people’s things in life they want to do. But mine has to be my recovery. That’s where Amy came into it. We actually sat down before the final and we booked a flight for the Monday morning to go to Spain for 10 days. “We just got out the gap straight after the county final and that was it. Which was good. It’s good to have that support system where you’re going, ‘Right, you understand me – let’s get out of here.’ I went to St John’s for an hour after the match and then we went home and got a pizza and watched a movie. That was me, content and happy out.” Nugent has spent plenty of time talking in public about his struggles over the years. He did his first big interview with The Irish News back in 2019, a couple of months after coming out of Cuan Mhuire in Newry. He has done the rounds of national media days promoting Movember and the GPA’s mental health initiatives. And it has helped people. He knows it has. [ From the archive: Domhnall Nugent to take time from hurling to help run mental health campaignOpens in new window ] “Recently I got an email from a guy who was at the gig I did in Croke Park two years ago. I went to do the launch of the Ahead of the Game for Movember. This guy messaged me to say that the day after I talked about addiction at it, he went to the GP and it saved his life. So you just never know the impact that you can make on people’s lives. That’s what it was about.” Through it all, he hasn’t sugar-coated anything. He has talked about being homeless, about being addicted to drink and drugs, about lying to the people closest to him. Stories of blowing thousands of pounds, of being left with nothing, of scrabbling around McDonald’s late at night looking to swipe leftover chicken nuggets. He has been brave and open and unflinching. Sometimes to a fault. “I was probably naive for myself. It was the right thing to do for other people, but I’m probably not so sure it was always the right thing to do for me. One, for my recovery and two, for my hurling. “I probably got put on a pedestal and probably pigeonholed myself as someone who was in recovery, someone who was in addiction. And kind of forgot about, ‘Oh, I actually need to work on being fitter or stronger and my touch needs to be better and I need to get better finishing.’ And all these things that I probably didn’t really think about much. “The other part of it, the validation part, that’s probably something that I kind of grabbed on to. People saying to me, ‘Oh, you’re great for speaking out and you’re this and you’re that.’ In some ways, that’s the same thing I was getting from drinking. “It’s two different things but it’s the same feeling. You’re being validated by a substance, whether that’s a human substance or a drink or a drug. So I probably grabbed on to that a wee bit too much. Then all of a sudden, you’re on social media and you’re a wee bit more active on Instagram and waiting on likes and comments because it’s like you’re chasing something. “But listen – do I regret it? No. I definitely would do it again because I know the impact that it’s all had. And there’s been a wee bit of growing up along the way too because I was so young when I got into rehab. I forget that. I forget that I’m six-and-a-half years sober and I’m 28.” Does it get easier? Not really. Or at least, that’s not really how he frames it. Sobriety isn’t a done deal. The lease runs out every night and you start again on a new agreement the next day. It isn’t about easier or harder. It’s just what he has to do. “I want to be very honest with you,” he says. “I think about drink a lot. There wouldn’t be a week in the past six and a half years where I wouldn’t have thought about having a drink. Or going, ‘Jesus, I’d love a pint.’ Or even a wee whiskey. I do think about it regularly. “Sometimes I dream about it and wake up the next morning, tasting Jameson down the back of my throat. You’d wake up sweating and afraid that you’ve relapsed and stuff like that. “So it’s definitely something that is still in me. And I’m just really, really good at the minute. I’m so happy I can say that now because I probably wouldn’t have before. Like, I’m so good and proud that I’m managing it really well through AA and through my friend group, the people who I surround myself with. “I’m so lucky. I’m in a good relationship and I have Amy and things are really, really good. She understands me and I understand her. But it took me a long time to be able to let someone into that journey with me. Even whenever I was sober, I was half-letting people in and getting afraid and pushing them off and doing mad things, stupid things. Just because I wasn’t comfortable. “I always just talk about this journey of no destination. That’s where I’m at. This journey doesn’t have a destination. Obviously it’s great, this kind of fairytale of winning a club championship. That’s brilliant. But that can’t be the journey. External things can’t be the journey. It has to start with you and end with you.” So on he goes and on they go. St John’s have only ever played one Ulster club hurling match – when they won Antrim in 1973, they went out the next day and trounced Ballygalget of Down before getting a walkover in the final against Dungiven. The following March they went all the way down to Cork where Blackrock beat them by 19 points in the All-Ireland semi-final. They start this weekend against Donegal club Setanta and after that, they can only go the only way he knows. One day at a time. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Celebrated illustrated history of the 15th century to be sold at Offaly auction

Antiquarian book dealers and academic libraries across Europe and the United States have already been in contact with Conor Purcell in advance of his auction of books – almost all of which belonged to one collector – on Wednesday, November 26th. As is so often the case, the sellers of The Library of An Irish Gentleman won’t reveal themselves. But, I expect some savvy collectors and local aficionados might know the provenance of these ancient books, such as the first edition of the Nuremberg Chronicle, printed in July 1493 (€20,000-€30,000). Conor Purcell of Purcell auctioneers in Birr, Co Offaly, says that it will be the first time that a copy of what is deemed to be the most extensively illustrated 15th century book, has ever been offered for sale at auction in Ireland. A pictorial history of the world, the Nuremberg Chronicle (known in German as Schedelsche Weltchronik or Schedel’s World History) was originally written in Latin by medical doctor and book collector, Hartmann Schedel. It includes woodcut illustrations of biblical scenes, early maps of Europe and the world and some of the first created topographical views of towns and cities in Europe and the Middle East. Nuremberg was one of the largest cities in central and western Europe in the 1490s. Around 400 copies of the original Latin version of the book are believed to be still in existence.Purcell says the 1587 edition of Holinshed’s Chronicles (€10,000-€20,000) – another highly collectable book in the auction – is a “cornerstone of English Renaissance historiography”. Compiled by Raphael Holinshed, these historical accounts of England, Scotland and Ireland would have been a primary source of material for writers such as William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and Edmund Spenser. Another highlight is a 1512 edition of a book of hours written in Latin and French (€5,000-€10,000). Books of hours were early Christian prayer books used by those who prayed at specific times of the day (known as canonical hours) in the monastic tradition. This book of hours includes fifteen prayers of St Brigid. During the Covid pandemic, Purcell Auctioneers began selling more and more books as they were easier to sell online and dispatch around the world. This dedication to book selling has paid off, as they have since sold the libraries of many public figures including the late politicians, Conor Cruise O’Brien and Garret FitzGerald, the late journalist, Bruce Arnold and the late owner of Grogan’s pub on Dublin’s South William St, Tommy Smith. “We take all the books from sellers, as intact book collections will absolutely create higher value as they gives a true reflection of the collecting nuances of each collector,” says Purcell. The two volumes of Christian Art in Ancient Ireland (Saorstat Eireann, 1932) compiled by the German archaeologist, Adolf Mahr (€80-€160) is another fascinating book in the Purcell auction. Mahr was a director of the National Museum of Ireland in the 1930s, but was later dismissed when he became leader of the Dublin Nazi chapter. Other books of interest include The Odyssey of Homer and the Iliad of Homer, translated by Alexander Pope and printed in 1715 (€1,000-€1,500), several editions of Paradise Lost by John Milton, and The Plays of William Shakespeare in ten volumes (€200-€400). De Búrca Rare Books, based in Blackrock, Co Dublin, also have a vast collections of historic and contemporary books of Irish interest for potential Christmas gifts. Meanwhile, Gormleys auctions is hosting a sale of paintings and prints by Irish and international artists on Tuesday, November 25th at 7.30pm. Gerard Gormley says that the sale reflects the increasing demand for original prints by well established artists. “Collectors recognise the accessibility, rarity and artistic integrity of prints which often provide an entry point in the market,” he says. Highlights at Gormley’s auction – which is on view at 57 Francis St, Dublin from November 19th-25th (10am-5.30pm daily except Sunday, which is 12pm-4pm) include Banksy’s satirical screen print, Morons (€15,000-€20,000). “The piece has become emblematic of Banksy’s critique of consumerism and the commodification of art, while paradoxically commanding significant value in the very market it ridicules,” says Gormley. Patrick Scott’s Tangram 1, one of three pieces using gold leaf (€3,000-€5,000), is also for sale. Finally, Christmas present hunters will no doubt find some potential purchases at the R. J Keighery auction in Waterford city on Monday, November 17th. Among the 750 lots is an electrified three storey over basement Georgian style dolls house, fitted out with period pieces (€600-€1,000). Thomas Keighery says there has also been a lot of interest in a Waterford Crystal chess set in a mahogany case (€3,000-€5,000). Musicians might be keen to have a look at the zither, an antique folk instrument (€50-€80); the French oak-cased small organ (€60-€100); or the upright piano made by the former Liverpool-based instrument suppliers, Rushworth and Dreaper (€60-€100).

Share this article Harvard Management Company, which manages Harvard University’s endowment, boosted its BlackRock Bitcoin ETF holdings to $442.8 million in Q3 2025, marking a 257% expansion in its crypto exposure, according to a new SEC filing. The prestigious institution’s Bitcoin ETF increase demonstrates growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a portfolio asset. The university’s substantial investment reflects broader adoption trends among major financial institutions, which have been increasingly incorporating Bitcoin ETFs into traditional investment portfolios since the products became available in early 2024. The filing also disclosed 661,391 shares of the GLD gold ETF worth $235 million, up 99% from the 333,000 shares reported in June. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Job Prospects for 2026 College Grads to Hit 5-Year Low While Employers Eye AI, Foreign Labor

The outlook for the college graduating class of 2026 has dimmed sharply as data shows employer hiring plans have stalled, job market ratings have slipped, and workforce competition has intensified due to automation and visa-based labor programs. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, based on data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), employers project the job market for 2026 graduates will be the weakest in half a decade. A survey conducted among 183 companies between August 7 and September 22 found that 51 percent of respondents rated the job market for new graduates as “poor” or “fair,” a sentiment not seen at this level since the COVID-19-era downturn in 2020-21. Only two percent of employers rated the market as “excellent.” The hiring slowdown follows a wave of large-scale layoffs from major employers, including Amazon, UPS, and Verizon — the latter reportedly preparing to cut 15,000 jobs, its largest workforce reduction ever. While overall hiring for 2026 graduates is technically expected to increase by 1.6 percent, that marks a steep drop from earlier projections for the Class of 2025. Historical trends show that spring hiring often falls short of earlier fall estimates. The divergence is reflected in NACE’s year-over-year hiring projections: from a near 30 percent jump in 2022 spring plans compared to 2021, projections have since plummeted, including a contraction for the Class of 2024. According to data from job platform Handshake, full-time job postings in August dropped over 16 percent year-over-year, while applications per job rose 26 percent. Over 60 percent of 2026 graduates surveyed reported pessimism about their career outlooks. Former recruiter Giavanna Vega, who was laid off from Automation Anywhere in 2023, said companies “don’t know where to invest” amid AI uncertainty and tariffs. “They don’t have the training,” she remarked about recent graduates, many of whom are being passed over for roles that are increasingly filled by laid-off mid-career professionals. The unemployment rate for recent graduates hit 4.8 percent in June, the highest in four years and above the national average. New college graduates are now not only competing with each other, but also with recently laid-off workers and foreign graduates entering the U.S. workforce through visa programs. Rising scrutiny of visa programs such as H-1B and OPT (Optional Practical Training) has enabled hundreds of thousands of foreign graduates to work in U.S. jobs originally intended for American college students. The Department of Justice (DOJ) under Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon has pledged increased enforcement of longstanding visa-related laws to curb what officials describe as the systemic replacement of domestic talent. Eric Sell, a senior lawyer at the DOJ Civil Rights Division, emphasized that the administration is determined to hold companies accountable for how they treat American workers, especially during periods of economic upheaval and rapid technological change. He stressed that under President Donald Trump’s leadership, technological advancement would “never be used as an excuse to forget the workers that built this country,” and he warned that those attempting to exploit chaotic growth for corporate gain “will be held accountable.” Public frustration has been intensifying. A new Cygnal poll finds that 44 percent of likely voters say companies exploit the H-1B system. Among swing voters, 43 percent agree with that assessment. Notably, the backlash against these visa programs is strongest among working-class Americans and voters without a college degree, key electoral constituencies ahead of the 2026 midterms. In 2024 alone, the Biden administration approved work permits for approximately 400,000 foreign college graduates through the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program — a 45 percent increase from 2020 levels under President Trump. Former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joe Edlow and other Trump administration officials have warned that programs like OPT are depressing wages and displacing American graduates, particularly in high-demand STEM and business fields. The pipeline from foreign student to U.S. worker also begins at the admissions level. Breitbart News opinion contributor Rich Kaye questioned why taxpayer-funded public universities are increasingly filling seats with international students who later convert F-1 student visas into work permits. “When a public university replaces a Georgia student with an F‑1 student in a high‑demand field,” Kaye wrote, “it increases the pipeline pressure tomorrow for H‑1B allocations in exactly the sectors where Americans could be trained to fill roles.” That pressure is already being felt by recent graduates like Nalin Haley, who told UnHerd that many in his peer group are struggling just to get started. “It’s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job — not one,” he stated. “I’m angry at that, because I’m having to try and help my friends get jobs when their parents got jobs immediately — not just after graduating college, but out of high school.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: ICE has not yet purchased translation technology promised for new agents

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Immigration and Customs and Enforcement has yet to purchase new translation technology that it promised would replace a Spanish-language course requirement for officers as part of an effort to speed up the agency’s hiring process, according to two Department of Homeland Security officials. In August, ICE officials told reporters that the agency had purchased new, “robust translation services” for officers to use in the field while pursuing immigration arrests as part of President Donald Trump’s deportation policy. Caleb Vitello, who was the head of training for new ICE recruits at the time, described the new technology as “so much more efficient” than the five-week Spanish course. ICE had considered providing officers with AI-powered translation services that can be used on body-worn cameras but has not purchased any, the two DHS officials said. The lack of Spanish classes or the body-worn translation devices for new ICE officers as they carry out arrests has sparked concern about potential communication misunderstandings that could endanger the agents and people in the communities they are targeting, the officials said. The Trump administration has sought to speed up ICE’s hiring process to meet its goal of hiring 10,000 new officers by the end of the year. An ICE spokesperson said in a statement that ICE has replaced the five-week Spanish course that was until July required for new officers with “a more robust translation service,” but declined to say what type of translation services the agency provides. The agency has relied on a translation service hotline that officers can call when processing immigrants in an office setting, which it continues to use, the DHS officials said. “Language classes, which previously covered only a specific dialect of Spanish, have been replaced with robust translation and interpretation services that apply to multiple languages,” an ICE spokesperson said in a statement. “ICE frequently encounters native speakers of a diverse range of languages, so modern technology-based solutions are more efficient resources in the field.” The U.S. Border Patrol still mandates Spanish training for new agents, according to the Office of Personnel Management. The body-worn translation technology combines body cameras many officers already wear on their vests with AI translation tools and can detect up to 50 languages. To use it, an officer pushes a button on the body camera and directs it to translate whatever language is being spoken. An AI-generated voice then repeats the words in English. While ICE so far has not provided new agents the devices, more than 200 police departments across the country are embracing the new technology. The police department in Joliet, Illinois, a city of 150,000 located about an hour outside of Chicago, in June began using the devices, which are developed by Axon Enterprise. Officials at the department told NBC News that its officers have used the device in more than 1,800 encounters involving 23 different languages. Officer Charles Moore said having them has helped build the community’s trust in local law enforcement. “Seeing people when they know that they’re understood, you see their faces light up,” Moore said in an interview with NBC News. Multiple confrontations involving federal agents and migrants in major U.S. cities have turned violent in recent months, though it’s unclear whether language problems may have contributed to them. In one of the latest cases to garner attention, a Mexican man and a deputy marshal were shot after a federal agent opened fire while attempting to arrest the man in downtown Los Angeles earlier this week, prosecutors said. Both are expected to recover. Jason Houser, who served as ICE chief of staff in the Biden administration, said a lack of basic Spanish-language skills for agents increases the chances of dangerous encounters. “That puts both the migrant at risk and potentially law enforcement as you’re taking away the capability for them to openly communicate with those that they interact with,” Houser said. With 65 million Latinos in the U.S., it’s increasingly common for police departments to mandate Spanish-language training. Most police departments in large cities require it. And in Texas, it’s mandatory for all police officers. In March 2025, under the Biden administration, ICE announced a pilot program to roll out body cameras to 1,600 out of 6,500 ICE officers. The Trump administration has made no publicized efforts to go beyond that initial 1,600. In addition to helping to safeguard law enforcement officers, language translation could reduce confusion for members of the public, immigration advocates and attorneys say. In August, Raquel Sanchez and her husband were driving to work in Washington, D.C., when they say they were stopped by seven unmarked ICE vehicles. An agent at her car door yelled, “What’s your status in the United States?” In the recording of the encounter, she and her husband struggled to respond because they don’t speak English, and the agents didn’t know Spanish. “I would ask them if we could talk in Spanish, but they kept talking in English,” she said in a phone interview with NBC News. Sanchez said she and her husband were handcuffed and driven an hour away to an ICE processing facility. She said she told the officers they had teenage boys at home, and her lawyer successfully pushed for her to be released with an ankle monitor. Her husband was moved to an ICE detention center a few hours away, according to Sanchez and her lawyer. In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said, “ICE makes arrests based on probable cause, and if officers know you are the target, they will make the arrest. If the subject is unknown, there are a number of ways to establish reasonable suspicion and probable cause.” “Additionally, ICE makes custody determination after arrest, which may include referring an illegal alien to ATD, depending on specific circumstances, such as medical needs,” the ICE spokesperson said, referring to alternatives to detention such as an ankle monitor. The police department in Corpus Christi, Texas, where less than half of its 260 officers are native Spanish speakers, uses the Axon AI-generated translation devices. Lt. Jose Gonzalez, who oversees professional standards for the department, said as a native Spanish speaker he was skeptical of the new technology. But after seeing how it’s helped officers in the field over the past few months, he’s now a believer. “It’s very important, because if you can’t communicate with someone during a traffic stop, you can’t figure out if there are weapons in the car,” Gonzalez said. Even so, Gonzalez noted that no technology is foolproof. “What if your camera malfunctions?” he said. “You have to have a foundation to still communicate.” Cristina Lozano Argüelles, an assistant professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, agrees. She called the new AI translation technology “exciting” but does not think it should replace Spanish training. “Spanish-language training for law enforcement isn’t just about learning vocabulary — it’s about building trust,” Argüelles said. “When officers can communicate directly with Spanish-speaking residents, interactions can be calmer, more respectful and more effective.” Laura Strickler is the senior investigative producer on the national security team where she produces television stories and writes for NBCNews.com.

Title: The Bubble Teeters

Time Published: 2025-11-14T23:00:52Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedNovember 14, 2025 Is the stock market bubble about to burst? It has seemed that way a few times over the past year, but so far each selloff has proved to be a blip on a relentless climb upwards. But now we’re starting to see signs of weakness in the sector that’s driving markets higher: AI/tech. Investors are beginning to digest that there’s simply not enough electricity in America to support endless new data center construction. And all the debt being raised by “hyperscalers” like Oracle and Meta is causing skeptics to question whether ROI will ever materialize. OpenAI’s co-founder/CEO Sam Altman raised eyebrows back on November 2nd when he seemingly had no answer about how he planned to spend $1.4 trillion on infrastructure with around $20 billion in annual revenue (and huge losses). Could this be the beginning stages of a crash? Sure. Alternatively, could it be another bear trap, like we saw in March/April? Also yes. Today we’re going to survey the latest market action, take a worrying look at the health of the American economy, and review ways to hedge for a crash (without necessarily shorting). The Magnificent 7 (Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA, Alphabet/Google, Meta, Tesla, Microsoft) are down around 10% from the highs, on average. A fairly typical correction so far. But second-tier AI/tech plays are taking larger hits. These stocks were red hot just a few months ago: The most speculative sectors of the market have taken a beating over the past few weeks. Whether this drawdown is the start of a crash, or a simple correction remains to be seen. I’m not buying the dip in U.S. tech or broad markets, nor do I plan to anytime soon. But I’m not shorting it in size either. This week I bought a few puts, but they’re very small for now. Just testing the water with some hedges. Eventually the time may come for a more substantial short position, but we’re not there yet. The risk of a “blow-off top” before the bubble pops is still there. My plan hasn’t changed. I’m heavily positioned in precious metals, miners, hard assets, and select emerging markets. With some cash on hand to take advantage of any market dislocations. One of the most concerning signals is seeing the real American economy barely treading water, despite record stock market strength. First up, layoffs are spiking: Source: Charlie Bilello We’re not at 2008 or 2020 levels yet, but the recent pace of layoff announcements is disturbing. And the most recent consumer sentiment survey out of the University of Michigan is hideous. It’s at the second-lowest level in the survey’s history going back to 1952. Source: UMich Consumers are burnt out. Inflation and a weak job market have taken their toll. And if sentiment is this bad during a bubble, what happens if we get a crash and recession? It’s unusual to see sentiment so low with stocks so high. Another sign that all is not well is the fact that the median U.S. homebuyer is now 59 years old. In 1980, that number was 31. Young people are priced out of the housing market. And as the chart below shows, this is having devastating effects on the percentage of 30-year-olds who are both married and homeowners. From 52% in 1950 to 13% today. A shameful indictment of our country’s trajectory. Despite stocks near record highs, all is not well beneath the surface. This is not a market where I want to be in overpriced stocks. I want plenty of exposure to precious metals and miners. And cheap emerging market stocks with fat yields, like Brazil. Of course, I do have some exposure to U.S. markets, mostly through retirement accounts. But during times like these, I want to hedge that exposure with alternative investments. Because when crashes happen, the hottest stocks get hit the hardest. And based on everything I’m seeing, we’re overdue. Remember that in mid-2022, markets were falling sharply. The Nasdaq 100 had dropped about 33% from its highs in late 2021. In November of 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, giving birth to the AI bubble. Since then the Nasdaq 100 is up 130%. AI saved the stock market, for a while at least. If investors begin to lose faith in the AI story, it could spell trouble. When we add in the economic signals above, I’m maintaining a bearish outlook.

Title: Why These Wall Street Experts Expect Big Things From Nvidia's Earnings Report Next Week

Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report its latest earnings after the market closes next Wednesday, and analysts are expecting big things. Analysts from Jefferies and Wedbush have each said in recent notes that they expect the artificial intelligence giant to "beat and raise," or report better financial metrics than analysts have projected and lift their future forecasts. "Hyperscale capex spending results for Q3 generally exceeded expectations," Wedbush analysts wrote, maintaining their $210 price target. "More importantly, the large hyperscalers nearly ubiquitously talked to an expectation of increasing spending trends into future periods as they continue to expand investment to support their AI efforts." Nvidia shares closed nearly 2% higher on Friday at around $190. The stock has gained 42% since the start of the year, far outpacing the gains of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Nvidia is the most valuable company on the market today, meaning its stock likely has an outsized impact on your portfolio, and potentially your retirement. The chipmaker's performance in quarterly earnings can affect the stock prices of a range of companies involved in the AI sector. The Wedbush analysts said that much of the growth in spending from "hyperscalers" such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) seems to end up being funneled to Nvidia, as the chipmaker "supplies a disproportionate amount of the AI server value." However, some investors and analysts are starting to question how much the biggest tech companies should be willing to spend before they see a clearer path to getting a return on their investment into AI. Meanwhile, many market participants have been looking for signs of a bubble. Bank of America analysts, keeping their price target at $275, said they expect Nvidia executives to reassure investors about their ability to meet demand, and said the company is facing high earnings expectations and growing skepticism around AI spending. Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 on revenue of $55.28 billion, each up more than 55% from the same time a year ago, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Data center revenue, the chips Nvidia sells that other companies buy to train and run a variety of AI models, is expected to grow 61% and make up $49.53 billion of Nvidia's revenue. Oppenheimer analysts lifted their price target for Nvidia earlier this week, calling the chipmaker the single company that is "best positioned to win" in the AI sector.

South Africa were worthy winners, their physical edge in the set piece, scrum and lineout, a significant factor against a gutsy Ireland side that produced several passages of excellent rugby but ultimately were undone by a propensity to make mistakes. Both teams deserve credit for the rugby they produced in horrendous weather at Musgrave Park. The visitors, with the backing of a gale, started with purpose and power and while the home side survived that prolonged assault, a penalty from a ruck offence, offside, gave outhalf Vusi Moyo a long range, wind-assisted opportunity, which he landed with plenty to spare. Ireland lost Arthur Ashmore after 10 minutes, the Terenure man had made one superb carry before his departure with a shoulder injury, but his replacement Cahersiveen’s Michael O’Sullivan in his first action put in a superb tackle. Centres Sean Walsh and Johnny O’Sullivan, secondrow Dylan McNiece, number eight Diarmaid O’Connell and tighthead prop Sam Bishti excelled in the collisions and manufactured positive gain-lines, the only cavil was that scrumhalf Chris Barrett needed to be a little sharper at times to clear the ball. Right wing Charlie Molony, one of the returning players from last season, was a delight to watch, his ability to leave defenders with a handful of nothing roused the hardy home support, while fullback Noah Byrne was another who excelled. Ireland outhalf Tom Wood, in his second season at this level, kicked a 40-metre penalty, a staggering effort into the teeth of the elements to bring the sides level. South Africa though were quickly in the ascendancy once again when hooker Siphosethu Mnebelele barged over for a try, following a well-crafted maul. Moyo kicked a fine conversion to give South Africa a 10-3 lead. Wood, whose astute kicking game had caused problems for the visitors, had the chance to reduce the deficit after McNeice made another super carry but the Irish outhalf was unable to post the 22-metre penalty that ensued. Just before halftime South Africa were very fortunate not to be reduced to 14 players. Irish outhalf Wood was taken out in the air by right wing Khuthadzo Rasivhaga. It looked like a red card offence, no attempt to legitimately contest possession, running underneath the player and causing Wood to land on his back and head. That French referee Julien Caulier and his assistant no more than a couple of feet from the incident decided to award a knock-on beggared belief. After a prolonged period of treatment, the Irish outhalf gingerly walked from the pitch to be replaced by Conor O’Shaughnessy. Ireland got the perfect start to the second half, centre Walsh breaking a tackle en route to the try line. O’Shaughnessy converted to make it 10-10 two minutes after the restart. The home side were guilty of some sloppy play thereafter, basic mistakes and poor decisions and it cost them dearly; two tries, one converted, both from mauls, 12-points and a yellow card for Michael O’Sullivan. Ireland responded positively, a brilliant break from Byrne the precursor to a try for O’Connell. Phiwayinkosi Kubheka barged over for a try, after another Irish error, converted by Moyo as the visitors got a reward for their scrum and general forward dominance. Centre Johnny O’Sullivan hauled his side back into the game on 68-minutes, sharp in blocking down Pieter van der Merwe and collecting the loose ball to dot down for a try, one that O’Shaughnessy converted to make it 22-29. But yet another Irish mistake gave Moyo a chance to tag on another three points with a penalty, a healthy 32-22 lead for the visitors going into the last 10 minutes.

Title: Should you worry about an AI bubble? Investment pros weigh in.

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 14, 2025 / 4:31 PM EST / CBS News Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring on expectations of runaway growth. But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance as investors worry the AI boom could go bust. The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth. Thursday's stock market tumble — when high-flying AI stocks such as Nvidia and CoreWeave led the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to see its biggest drop in months — fueled further anxiety this week about another bubble. Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability. "The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it," Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News. In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called "Magnificent 7" — Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar. That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI. "No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped," Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email. Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio — a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits — found it is "roughly half" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s. "So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble," they noted. The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting. "This is different in the sense that these companies — the companies that are so highly valued — actually have earnings and stuff like that," Powell said. "So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies." Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%. Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution. For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say. "We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains," Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News. For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a "4th industrial revolution" that could supercharge economic growth. "This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026," he wrote this week in a research note. "The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology," Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.

Title: Binance adds BlackRock’s BUIDL as off-exchange collateral for institutional traders

The integration marks another step in centralized exchanges adopting tokenized Treasurys, expanding RWA collateral across major trading platforms. Binance has begun accepting BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) as off-exchange collateral, giving institutions a way to trade on the exchange while keeping their assets with custodians. The integration combines BlackRock’s onchain money market fund with Binance’s custody systems, enabling traders to earn yield on BUIDL while using it to support trading positions on the exchange. A new BUIDL asset class will also launch on BNB Chain, expanding the token’s reach beyond Ethereum and opening it to a wider set of onchain applications, according to a blog post by Binance on Friday. With the addition of BUIDL, Binance supports multiple yield-bearing tokenized assets, including Circle’s USYC and OpenEden’s cUSDO. BUIDL is BlackRock’s first onchain liquidity fund — a tokenized, interest-bearing USD vehicle issued through Securitize. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, oversaw roughly $13.4 trillion in assets as of Q3 2025. Related: Securitize to go public in $1.25B BlackRock-backed merger As tokenized money-market funds shift from simple yield products to mainstream trading collateral, Binance joins a growing group of exchanges allowing qualified clients to post Treasury-backed tokens to back their positions. In July, Deribit and Crypto.com began accepting BUIDL as collateral, giving institutional traders a low-volatility, yield-bearing asset they can use in place of cash or stablecoins. In September, Bybit followed with support for QCDT, a Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA)-approved tokenized money-market fund backed by US Treasurys. The trend echoes traditional finance, where companies often pledge Treasurys and money-market funds as collateral through bank-run triparty systems rather than keeping assets on a trading venue. Tokenized US Treasurys have become the second-largest real-world assets (RWA) beyond stablecoins, with a current market cap of $8.57 billion, according to RWA.xyz data. The funds are led by BlackRock’s BUIDL, with about $2.52 billion in total value, Circle’s USYC with $1.06 billion and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, with $850 million.

THE OLDEST EVER recruit to graduate from the Garda College has encouraged other people his age to “go for it”. Jeremiah Bourke, 51, said he wanted to join the gardaí when he was younger but missed the opportunity. He said he recognises it is going to be a “tough job”, but said: “You’re never too old. “If you’re able, why not? Give it a go. I’d say to anybody out there, if you want to go for it – go for it.” He added: “I’ve done it, anyone can do it.” Bourke said he had always had hope that he could become a garda, so re-applied when the recruiting age limit increased from 35 to 50 at the start of last year. He was within that age range when he applied. “I was in the retail business and wanted to give that a chance, but unfortunately as time goes fast the closing date for the competition passed me by.” He added: “I didn’t miss the bus time – and here I am attesting today at a later stage.” He said it was “not easy” and “a bit daunting” to go through the training alongside younger recruit, but said he was supported by his wife and two children as well as all those at the College. He was one of 194 gardaí attesting from the Templemore Garda College in Co Tipperary on Friday. Among them, Garda Amy Ní Riada was eager to get “stuck in” after trading in a career in the media to join An Garda Síochána. The former RTÉ journalist, from Castleisland in Co Kerry, said she developed a taste for working in high-pressure environments and a role with variety. Garda Amy Ní Riada, during graduation at Templemore Garda College, Co Tipperary. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo She was inspired to join the gardaí seeing the response to the November 2023 riots in Dublin. “It was an eye opener for me that I wanted to be stuck in and got involved in that way.” Advertisement Ní Riada, who will be stationed in Midleton, Co Cork, also said being in An Garda Síochána was perfect” for her desire to work with the most vulnerable people in society, having previously reported on climate change, social issues and violence against women in east Africa. They were among 194 new gardaí and 17 garda reserves attesting from the Garda College in Templemore on Friday. It is the largest single attestation of new gardaí since 2019 and the college will also see its largest class of recruits in a decade enter next week. Garda Kristina Courtney also left a career in communications and media production to join the gardaí. She said she was inspired to join after getting an insight into the operations of An Garda Síochána by working on RTÉ’s Crimecall programme. Garda Amy Ní Riada (left) and Kristina Courtney, during graduation at Templemore Garda College, Co Tipperary Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Part of her role involved making actors “look like the bad guys”. Asked how she felt about dealing with real bad guys, she replied: “I’m up for the challenge.” Dubliner Adam O’Rourke said he joined An Garda Síochána because he wanted a career where he could help people and challenge himself. Garda O’Rourke, from Walkinston, previously served with the Defence Forces in Lebanon. Now being stationed in Blackrock, Dublin, he said he was happy to start making a difference in the community: “It is a fantastic day, I couldn’t be happier.” Speaking at the Garda College, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said it was a “great honour” to “witness the continued growth of An Garda Síochána and to welcome its newest members”. Of the 194 attesting on Friday, 137 are men and 57 are women and the new probationers will be assigned to divisions across the country by the Garda Commissioner. Of the new gardai, 87 will be deployed across the Dublin Metropolitan Region, with 47 going to the Southern Region, 39 to the Eastern Region and 21 to North Western Region. Garda Commissioner Justin Kelly (centre) with graduating gardai (left to right) Jeremiah Burke, Amy Ni Riada, Kristina Courtney and Adam O'Rourke Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Commissioner Justin Kelly met some of those graduating and, speaking at the ceremony, said: “Today is a proud day. A day to celebrate with your family and loved ones. “A day to take stock of all it has taken to get you to this point.

Title: NYC Comptroller Brad Lander Presses Spotify On ICE Recruitment Ads

We'll keep digging -- no matter who wants the truth buried. Become a HuffPost member and fuel reporting they can’t silence. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Senior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk New York City’s chief financial officer wrote to Spotify Thursday to press the company for details about the recruitment ads for Immigration and Customs Enforcement that have been running on the platform in recent weeks. Comptroller Brad Lander, a recent mayoral candidate and notable supporter of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, wrote to Spotify “about recent developments that may violate Spotify’s advertising policies and impact long-term shareholder value.” Specifically, Lander wants to know about ICE recruitment ads on Spotify, which he wrote have “sparked widespread backlash and at least one major national organization is urging Spotify users to cancel their subscription,” a reference to Indivisible’s “Don’t Stream Fascism: Cancel Spotify” campaign. “In too many cities, dangerous illegals walk free as police are forced to stand down,” says one version of the ad, which was recorded by a TikTok user and archived by fact-checking site Snopes. “Join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst, with bonuses up to $50,000 and generous benefits. Apply now.” “From a fiduciary perspective,” Lander wrote, he is “concerned about the reputational risks these ads may create for the company, which could hamper long-term growth, and [wants] to better understand how the company assessed these ads against the company’s stated advertising policies.” Lander wrote that the pension funds “hold significant investments in Spotify.” A spokesperson for his office said that, taken together, the funds have 691,681 shares of Spotify, worth $482,793,542 as of Sept. 30. Spotify’s share price has fallen slightly since then. A Spotify spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement: “This ad itself is part of a wider campaign from the U.S. government running across multiple platforms, including television, streaming, and online channels. Users can help control their ad experience by liking or disliking an ad or by logging into their account via web browser and updating their ad preferences.” Lander’s letter asks Spotify how it assessed the ads’ against company policy prohibiting “systemic discrimination and marginalization,” and whether the company has assessed “the impact of this controversy on subscriber retention, artist relationships, or brand perception,” among other inquiries. “Hopefully what we’ll get is good answers to the questions we’re asking,” Lander told HuffPost in an interview Friday morning. He characterized the letter as an initial engagement between a representative of New York City employee pension funds — as comptroller, Lander is a trustee of each of the five funds — and a company in which those funds have an investment stake. If Spotify doesn’t have a satisfactory response to his questions, Lander said, the city’s funds could work with other investors to press Spotify for answers or consider a shareholder resolution to do so. “In some cases [in the past], where we have been unable to get answers we are looking for, or have a satisfactory engagement, we have divested from, or sold the stock of, particular companies or sectors,” he said. “We only do that after a lot of engagement. Our strong preference is to use our position as investors to reach resolution. We do this from a responsible fiduciary perspective, believing that what we’re doing is helping increase the value of the companies we’re invested in … we’re just starting here, this is the first letter we’re writing.” The comptroller said he is concerned with systemic discrimination in the Trump administration’s “mass deportation” agenda — “and that includes any ads,” he said. “The mass deportation effort involves a broadscale hiring effort to make ICE the largest law enforcement agency in American history.” Lander noted a trend of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents being arrested by immigration agents. “Essentially every time, [it is] a person of color, without, so far as we can tell, lawful basis for many of the arrests,” he said. “If you are conducting arrests without lawful basis, and they are consistently of people of one ethnicity, that is a systemic civil rights violation — and I believe these ads are part of it,” he added. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, doesn’t advertise exclusively with Spotify. Recruitment ads to become an immigration agent have also appeared on platforms including X, YouTube, LinkedIn and Meta, and on cable television, The Independent noted. Separately, DHS has spent millions of dollars on advertising pressuring people to “self-deport.” Lander said Thursday’s letter was specifically regarding Spotify’s “quite strong anti-discrimination policy — and we’re asking for how they assess these ads against that.” Lander’s letter amounts to a shot across the bow for Spotify. As comptroller, he has a legal “fiduciary” obligation to act in the best financial interests of New York City’s pension funds. As well as trustee, the comptroller serves as an investment advisor and custodian for the five funds — one each for police, firefighters, educators, non-pedagogical educational workers, and other city workers. While he does not have unilateral control over the pension funds, he has influence over the funds’ administration. Lander noted that the five funds’ responsible investing program is staffed by the comptroller’s office and that “we do a letter like this in consultation with our boards.” Combined, the funds have over $300 billion in assets under management, making them the fourth largest public pension plan in the country, according to the comptroller’s office. Lander’s office shared the letter, which is addressed to Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, with HuffPost. Lander himself has been arrested by federal agents twice in recent months at the immigration court in lower Manhattan, where agents have been systematically arresting migrants showing up for scheduled court check-ins — and where Lander frequently observes proceedings. “We owe it to the families of those detained — and every New Yorker impacted by Donald Trump’s mass deportation machine — to keep showing up and demanding accountability for the violence, cruelty, and lawless abduction of our neighbors,” he said last month after pressing DHS for answers about the return to duty of one particularly violent officer. Spotify isn’t only facing pressure over the ICE advertisements. Ek’s venture capital firm, Prima Materia, recently led a 600 million euro funding round for Helsing, a European military technology company, which led to an exodus of artists from the platform. Ek is also chairman of Helsing. We believe our mission of independent journalism has never been more important.

Title: Walmart's CEO retires: How Doug McMillion transformed the retail giant

David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images With Walmart CEO Doug McMillon set to retire early next year and be replaced by company veteran John Furner, it’s worth a look at where the company stands after McMillon’s 11-year tenure at the helm. McMillon has left a significant mark on Walmart and on the wider retail sector. David Haigh, CEO at Brand Finance, a London-based brand valuation company, provides some numbers that Walmart racked up under McMillon’s leadership: Walmart’s stock price is also a big piece of McMillon’s legacy. During his tenure, Walmart's shares rose by 310%, beating both the S&P 500 and its retail competitors. “The retirement of Doug McMillon will send a small shock wave through Walmart, simply because he has been an excellent leader and steward of the company,” Neil Saunders, a managing director at retail analytics firm GlobalData, said in a new research note. When McMillon early next year, it will mark the end of a transformational era under his watch. “McMillon took over at a moment when Amazon was rising and consumer expectations were shifting, and he leaves the company significantly more digital, data-driven, and global than when he arrived,” said Kaveh Vahdat, founder and president at RiseOpp, a marketing strategies company. “For Walmart, the change in leadership brings both opportunity and risk: The business is stronger, but the playbook must now evolve under a new era of margin pressure and economic uncertainty.” Business experts say McMillon was particularly innovative and visionary in implementing these strategic windfalls for Walmart. McMillon’s “try often, fail fast” mindset abandoned Walmart’s historically risk-averse management posture. “That strategy wasn’t about slogans but about creating enough internal permission to modernize at scale,” said Louisa Loran, a corporate transformational growth specialist and author of the book Leadership Anatomy in Motion. “It’s why automation could be framed as a partnership rather than a threat, and why the digital build-out didn’t fracture Walmart’s culture.” Now Furner will inherit that environment, with an operational foundation designed for accelerated performance, not a reset. “This succession signals that Walmart has crossed an important threshold: moving from the hard lift of transformation into a phase of confident expansion, driving margin expansion,” Loran said. During his tenure, McMillon leveraged that risk-taking management style to form key partnerships with Google’s Waymo, along with Uber and Lyft for product deliveries, among other deals. One of McMillon’s biggest operational shifts was turning Walmart into a hybrid organization, part retailer and part technology platform. “That change improved speed and visibility across the supply chain, but it also blurred the company’s identity and stretched its management structure,” Vahdat said. “Under his leadership, Walmart became much better at connecting digital and physical retail, yet keeping margins steady became more difficult as logistics and technology spending grew.” Walmart is almost unrecognizable from the company McMillon inherited, and that’s a big advantage for Furner. “A decade ago, Walmart was a legacy brick-and-mortar powerhouse with a bad reputation for underpaying workers and being the ultimate cheap discounter, struggling to define its digital strategy,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder at Cowen Partners Executive Search. “Today, it operates much more like a tech-enabled logistics company, akin to Amazon, that happens to have stores attached.” Culturally, McMillon transformed Walmart from a defensive to an innovative company. “The place was depressed, executives were embarrassed to say they worked there, and competitors didn’t see Walmart as a serious strategic threat,” Cole said. “McMillon brought in tech-heavy, younger leadership and made real investments in frontline employees.” Operationally, McMillon made a significant impact across other key C-suite areas. “He built a real e-commerce business, modernized the supply chain into an advanced logistics network, and drove Walmart into higher-margin digital plays, including marketplace, advertising, and services, all wrapped in a true omnichannel model,” Cole said. Furner, who has been the CEO of Walmart U.S., should be a big beneficiary of McMillon's leadership and his innovative vision for the retail giant — and those advantages should kick in right away. “Stepping aside now with a clear internal successor in John Furner and a multi-year advisory role, is succession planning done right,” Cole said. “It gives the next CEO a runway while the company is strong and locks in McMillon’s legacy as the leader who modernized Walmart instead of the one who stayed too long.” For the retail sector, McMillon’s exit underscores that the job description for a big-box CEO has permanently shifted toward technology, data, and supply-chain sophistication. “Going forward,” Cole said, “corporate boards will use this transition as a template.”

Title: The conference, K.M. and the ambassador, Tsipras, the “free dove” and its…consequences, the green eagle from Chios & why the Athens Stock Exchange now feels like August

Time Published: 2025-11-14T18:12:24Z
Full Content:
Hello, today we aspire to be the topic of the day, since the conference organized by “Proto Thema” and travel.gr at the “Grande Bretagne” hotel will host the Prime Minister, the U.S. Ambassador Gilfoyle, Hatzidakis, Papastavrou, Hardalias, the president of SEV Spyros Theodoropoulos, as well as dozens of distinguished Greek and foreign entrepreneurs, scientists, and public figures. Our theme is “The Intelligence Age: Travel, Culture and Connection.” Of particular interest is the open discussion about everything with Mitsotakis and the beloved actor Giannis Bezos. Today there will be yet another episode in the Tsipras–Vaxevanis saga, as the former’s publishing house filed for an injunction against the latter’s outlet to prevent it from publishing excerpts from the book that is due to be released in a few days. I asked my source why a politician and a journalist—who were inseparable during SYRIZA’s heyday, especially when that politician happened to be prime minister—have reached such extremes. Well, I was told that the relationship soured later, when Tsipras was in the opposition, and Vaxevanis feels he didn’t treat him well. These things happen—misunderstandings or friendships that break, especially in politics, and of course the full truth is known to the two sides themselves, not to the… audience, particularly when public figures are involved. What I want to say is that Tsipras, with his book and mainly with the “free dove” strategy, should have expected such clashes, bitterness, and distress. And this is only the beginning—when the book comes out, there will be much more, possibly much worse. In that sense, I don’t know whether he did the right thing, because it’s like taking an entire party onto the psychoanalyst’s couch. A lot of inner feelings will come out—especially from those who only five years ago thought they were “big shots,” while they were merely a product of a turbulent political period. Therefore, some from SYRIZA will throw stones at him and others will flatter him, hoping that through him they might find their way back to Parliament. On the other hand, the book has already secured crazy publicity—publicity I’m not sure it would have had otherwise. Good or bad, it’s still publicity, and perhaps at this stage that’s what matters most. Meanwhile, Nikos A. sits atop his successes and choices and enjoys them. What do I mean? Yesterday a PASOK MP from Chios, named Stavros Michailidis, appeared on TV and hinted that the firefighting planes announced by Mitsotakis are a scandal. “Why do we need these surveillance and data-recording aircraft when we live in the era of drones, and with a 19-seat capacity, at that?” the MP wondered. When the journalist told him that they are not 19-seaters but… regular aircraft, he replied: “I know, I know, because I’m from the Air Force. I read that they were 19-seaters—Mitsotakis wants to give someone a job.” What happened is that the MP, whose CV says he is a Rear Admiral of the Coast Guard (and not anything Air Force-related), read in the government announcement that the new aircraft consume far less fuel than a small 19-seat commercial airplane. As you can understand, Mr. Michailidis didn’t bother to read even a… simple announcement, yet he had time to go on TV and say his nonsense. What can the party leader do after that? I hear that today at noon, after K. M. crosses swords with Androulakis in “Prime Minister’s Question Time,” it is quite likely he will drop by the Members’ Lounge to chat with ND MPs. In the “blue” camp, things have always been worked out around a table, but K. M. avoids dinners. The in-person meeting between Kimberly Guilfoyle and Archbishop Ieronymos was particularly warm, and she revealed that he was the first person she had spoken to by phone before arriving. I’m told that Guilfoyle, who gives especially elegant gifts, brought the Archbishop a large silver coin custom-made for him. Their conversation was open and wide-ranging, while Ieronymos suggested they do a charitable tour in the coming months of the social structures supported by the Archdiocese—obviously in Attica, but also in Boeotia. He also proposed a joint visit to the Holy Monastery of Hosios Loukas, about which Ieronymos has written a book that has been translated into English and which he made sure to gift to the ambassador. After meeting the Archbishop, the ambassador went yesterday to the Ministry of Defense, where she was received by Dendias with the blue carpet they roll out for ambassadors and the ceremonial guard appropriate for the occasion. The interesting bit I hear is that Dendias is preparing to travel again early next week to the United States—this time to the West Coast, toward the San Francisco area. Each of his visits is linked with visits to facilities that produce and develop innovative weapons systems. The government may not officially confirm Zelensky’s arrival in Athens for security reasons—as is always the case—but I can’t help telling you that yesterday a group of Ukrainian advance staff made visits to the Presidency, Maximos Mansion, and Parliament, where he will go on Sunday. There were 13 people in total, from the Press Office, Protocol, and the Ukrainian Embassy, who were arranging details. Zelensky will have with him six close aides according to the plan. What no one should take for granted is the arrival time, which is provisionally listed as 12:30. And the previous time he came to Athens, then-president Sakellaropoulou had to wait for him for several hours, compared with the initial schedule. Yesterday in the parliamentary committees discussion began on Deputy Minister Marinakis’ bill for ERT, the first for public television in 12 years. SYRIZA and Popi Tsapanidou didn’t like the fact that order is finally being brought to the mess of uncollected license fees—in other words, our money—because, shockingly, the AADE will send notice letters to those who owe. Marinakis wasn’t wrong to say that the state must—finally—respect everyone, including the “suckers” who have been paying their taxes and contributions consistently all these years. After years, following the bill on the registry of print and online media, order is now being restored to issues of public broadcasting, and soon the matter of licenses for regional stations and for radio stations operating on temporary permits since 2002—back in Dimitris Reppas’ days—will also be resolved. Self-evident things… A longtime friend and sharp political observer called me yesterday to remind me that Nikos Nikolopoulos—who, through Nikos Karachalios, “spoke” with Karystianou back when SYRIZA-ANEL was in power—had, among other things, an obsession. What was it? The constant complaints through parliamentary questions about the infamous 717 contract. He constantly accused the companies involved of scandals and demanded that the contract be stopped. Need I say more? On Monday—barring unforeseen developments—it appears that Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) will have passed under the control of Euronext. What is circulating among the various parties involved in the deal is that the percentage Euronext seems likely to gather ranges between 54% and 56%. This, of course, remains to be confirmed on Monday afternoon, as the deadline has passed and institutionally there is no longer the possibility of either a time extension or a price adjustment. Everything suggests that the appropriate balances have been achieved at an institutional level. We’re not even talking about the domestic side, where mutual fund companies (AEDAK) bought and will tender their shares, brokerage firms did everything they could with their clients, and so on. And at the level of foreign institutional investors, it appears that the necessary understandings have been reached with the arbitrage funds (which have a weighted presence) as well as other institutional shareholders abroad. In contrast, where there seems to be some anxiety is regarding ATHEX’s retail shareholders, but I am not in a position to say whether this concern stems from genuinely low participation or whether it is part of an effort to mobilize more individual shareholders at the final moment of the tender offer so that the outcome can be presented as a bigger success. If the column had to place a bet, it would wager that next week ATHEX will belong to Euronext. What troubles the column is the following: If Euronext acquires ATHEX—as everything indicates—are there grounds for a faster-than-expected upgrade of the stock market? The agencies that handle such evaluations consider certain events as extraordinary (e.g., a capital increase for listed companies) and adjust their assessments. Obviously, a series of other parameters must be met simultaneously (which we do not know), and then the upgrade takes place automatically at that moment and not on scheduled dates. It is also possible that the agencies (MSCI, FTSE, etc.) may wait for the transition of the Athens Exchange to the Euronext platform to be completed, with the relevant decision coming in two or three months, as it is the intention of Euronext to proceed with a squeeze-out process as soon as possible and to complete it by mid-February 2026. The question is reasonable because JP Morgan and HSBC (who have insight into capital flows) do not consider that the upgrade will be a positive development for the Athens market, and beyond that, our previous experience with a past market upgrade can be summed up with the phrase “long-lasting trouble.” OTE’s CEO, Kostas Nebis, described as strategically important the deal with GEK TERNA and Grid Telecom to acquire 100% of TERNA Fiber, which manages 7 out of the 10 geographical zones of the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFBB) project, with OTE having undertaken the remaining three. This is a major PPP project, with a budget of €743 million (€921 million including VAT), of which €250 million is co-financed public expenditure, and the rest will be covered by private capital. Since 2023, OTE has been implementing the project in three geographical zones, and with the completion of the above agreements, OTE will assume the entire project, with the concession period (service period), before the infrastructure is transferred to the State, amounting to 23 years. Speaking to analysts, Nebis stressed that OTE could not allow the project to potentially end up in the hands of competitors when it had already undertaken 3 out of 10 areas, as it concerns around half a million households in semi-urban and rural areas of the country, in networks where OTE already holds the lion’s share of the market. As for OTE’s results, what matters is the positive revision of its 2025 cash-flow guidance to €530 million from €460 million previously, something clearly beneficial for shareholders. Shareholders will receive a special dividend of €0.10 per share due to the sale of the subsidiary Telekom Romania Mobile Communications, but the most important aspect of this sale is that OTE stops “bleeding” because of Romania. The stock closed yesterday down 3% at €16.4 on a very strong day for the market, but such behaviours are likely to reappear in various stocks as we are in a period of weight adjustments ahead of MSCI Greece’s rebalancing on November 24. It is also possible that the lack of enthusiasm on the Athens market for OTE’s share was caused by a line item of +€52 million in the third-quarter financial statements titled “extraordinary deferred tax,” whereas last year there was a tax expense of -€48.5 million. Additionally, pre-tax results are 12% lower on a comparable basis without tax burdens/benefits. In any case, OTE’s stock is a dividend-yielding investment choice and not a technological growth story. OTE remains the sixth-heaviest stock on the Athens Exchange, with a market capitalization exceeding €6.2 billion. It does not disappoint with its performance but does not attract aggressive buyers seeking quick returns by year-end. And since we mentioned above the OTE–GEK TERNA deal and noted yesterday that Australian infrastructure funds are investing in the listed company, let us add that substantial and careful groundwork preceded the effort to attract these specific investors. Specifically, everything started in early autumn, when BlackRock hosted a closed investment event at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, where GEK TERNA’s prospects were presented. The event had very strict attendance and participation rules, photography was forbidden, the meetings were confidential, and the event was not widely publicized. At that time, representatives of two large Australian infrastructure-investment funds (4D Infrastructure Group with $13 billion AUM and Resolution Capital with €17 billion AUM) approached management and requested further information. A small group of GEK TERNA executives travelled to Australia, made the necessary presentations, and provided answers and data. The first two funds brought in additional interested investors from the distant continent, and the result is becoming evident these days. GEK TERNA has already surpassed a market capitalization of €2.5 billion, but even more important is the increase in trading volume, while the rise in the share price follows a clear “professional” pattern. Only a few days after his brief but notable presence in Athens at the P-TEC conference, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright returned to the spotlight, this time opening the annual conference of the American Nuclear Society. And although he did not directly mention Greece or the discussions he held in the Greek capital, his references to “broader energy strategies” and “collaboration with friendly nations” did not go unnoticed by those in the know. In energy-sector circles, it is widely considered that Athens did not appear on his recent schedule by chance. With Greece seeking to position itself as a hub of energy security and technological innovation in the region, Wright’s indirect references to the need to harness artificial intelligence and small modular reactors (SMRs) fuel speculation about potential U.S. support—or at least knowledge transfer—to the Greek side, particularly in areas that touch industry and data centers. The Secretary made sure to set the tone of the new era: “If we want to lead in AI, we must rapidly accelerate the development of electricity generation,” he said, implying that artificial intelligence and nuclear energy will be the two pillars of American energy supremacy. Behind the scenes, his presence in Athens is said to have opened channels of communication with members of the Greek government and energy-market executives, at a moment when the U.S. views Greece not only as a gateway to the Eastern Mediterranean but also as a potential ground for technological pilot projects. The cycle of speedboat services to the islands has come to a close, marking the end of a period during which the islands—especially in the peak months—were served with additional routes beyond the conventional ones, facilitating both residents and visitors. Connections continue with conventional vessels, which, however, do not fully cover the needs of islanders, particularly in terms of frequency and speed of routes. At the same time, freight traffic is being served normally by cargo vessels, which maintain a steady presence in the port. The issue of the second inter-Cycladic route, which had been discussed at times, seems to have moved to the background. The inter-Cycladic line is the maritime service that connects the islands with one another without necessarily passing through major mainland ports. Beyond the primary basic link, there is a need for an additional route or a second vessel to meet demand and provide an alternative option—for example, when one vessel is immobilized or when needs are increased. We therefore await decisions for the next season. The trading week began with the General Index at 1,986.89 points. Yesterday marked the 4th consecutive upward session of the week, closing at 2,074 points—already a rise of over +4%. Such a rise had not been seen since the pleasant days of summer, when under the August heat the General Index broke through the 2,000-point “barrier.” All of this took place yesterday without the help of foreign stock markets, which were drifting in negative territory, with New York futures also signalling negative sentiment. Awaiting Fitch’s credit rating review of the Greek economy tonight, the General Index closed yesterday with gains of +1.44% at 2,074.96 points, while today it traded between 2,057.70 points (+0.20%) and 2,083.31 points (+1.45%). Trading value— the highest of the four-day rally—reached €255.9 million, with block trades worth €18.4 million. Eurobank (+3.09% at €3.5) and Piraeus (+3.03% at €7.14) set the pace for the session, followed by Athens International Airport (+2.81% at €10.23), Bank of Cyprus (+2.5% at €8.2), Helleniq Energy (+2.24% at €8.2), TITAN (+2.12% at €43.35), and Metlen (+2.11% at €43.5). Gains above 1% were also recorded by PPC, Alpha Bank, Optima Bank, and Motor Oil. In mid-cap stocks, ADMIE stood out (+4.58% at €3.08) following the Greek–Cypriot summit, as did Austriacard (+2.14% at €5.26 after its 9-month results announcement) and the Thessaloniki Port Authority (+2.84% at €35). The Greek company Theon, listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, is expecting—any day now—the German parliament’s decision on the €1-billion contract for the supply of 100,000 night-vision devices (NVG) by Theon and the German firm Hensoldt. This sheds light on Christian Hadjiminas’ decision to acquire 9.8% of the French company Exosens in October—an acquisition analysts considered an “expensive investment for a minority stake.” Through this move, Theon secured the supply of the critical 16mm image-intensifier tubes (IIT) it needs just before European demand surges. Exosens is the only manufacturer outside the U.S. that has invested in 16mm tubes. American manufacturers L3Harris and Elbit Systems of America are committed to replacing 400,000 units for the U.S. Army and cannot export their superior 18mm tubes outside the U.S. This leaves the European— and also the Saudi—market to Theon and smaller competitors. In 2026, Theon will invest €10 million to expand its production facility in Koropi. With five “name-brand” institutional portfolios in its shareholder register, TREK Development begins its journey on the Alternative Market of the Athens Stock Exchange (ENA+). Next Monday, the opening bell of the trading session will be rung by Dinos Papapolyzos, who has already completed three decades in infrastructure project development and financing, as well as in the construction of specialized projects in Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Smart Technologies (Smart Water & Smart Cities). With a turnover of around €4 million, zero debt, and first-half profits of €560,000, TREK Development will list 17.4% of its share capital on the stock exchange, with an initial trading price of €1.4 per share. Seventy-four percent of the listed shares were covered by institutional funds as well as entrepreneurs. The Turkish defense company Aselsan has secured yet another €1.1-billion contract for the Steel Dome program. This is its second major order for 2025, after the €1.65-billion agreement in September, while this year alone Aselsan has signed contracts worth $7.6 billion—an all-time record. Turkey is accelerating the Steel Dome, a fully AI-driven integrated air-defense network. Aselsan is now investing $1.5 billion in Ankara for new production facilities aimed at creating Europe’s largest air-defense systems plant by 2032. This reveals the real backdrop behind the recent visits of the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor to Ankara. Aselsan has already been invited to design phases of NATO’s new GBAD and Germany’s ESSI, which aims to link all European air-defense systems. GBAD (Ground-Based Air Defence) is NATO’s ground-based system protecting against aerial and missile threats. The German ESSI (European Sky Shield Initiative) is a German project launched in 2022 to build a unified European air-defense system. The conclusion? With Europe’s defense industry lacking production capacity and the EU’s “Drone Wall” needing immediate solutions, Turkey appears to be positioning itself as Europe’s de facto air-defense provider. Seventeen full years have passed since the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis that led to Lehman Brothers’ collapse and a global financial meltdown. Today, subprime loans—loans to borrowers with low credit ratings—threaten the U.S. economy not through housing but through the auto market. The percentage of low-credit-score borrowers more than 60 days behind on payments skyrocketed to 6.65% in October, the highest level in 31 years. The collapse of Tricolor Holdings, the largest subprime auto lender, acted as a catalyst that forced major financial institutions to reassess their overall exposure to the sector. The strategic restructuring that banks are undertaking in subprime auto loans may become the next major problem. If they attempt complex loan securitizations with high yields in a liquidity-rich market hungry for returns, then history may repeat itself on a smaller scale. Risk-shifting to smaller lenders and tightening lending criteria are already underway. Explore related questions

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back! Harry, Rory and Jason! The venture capital playbook is broken. Not bent — broken. In the latest 20VC x SaaStr episode, Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll dissect why even Sequoia is making dramatic leadership changes, why seed investing at $50M pre-money might not work anymore, and what it actually takes to build venture returns in the age of AI. This isn’t your typical venture conversation about “exciting trends.” This is three investors with $3+ billion in combined AUM telling you what’s actually working, what’s spectacularly failing, and why the old playbook from 2015-2022 is now a liability. On Venture Capital Evolution: On AI Investment Strategy: On Deal Dynamics: On Portfolio Construction: On Fundraising Process: On Market Dynamics: When Sequoia replaced Roelof Botha as managing partner after just three years with Pat Grady and Alfred Lin in a split leadership structure, the venture world noticed. But the reaction from our panel was telling: this wasn’t about interpersonal drama or normal succession planning. “Whenever you have a CEO change happening in venture, it’s because something isn’t working,” Rory stated bluntly. “This is dissatisfaction about how the firm is doing relative to the competition. They missed some rounds and some deals. They passed on some great companies.” But rather than viewing this as a Sequoia-specific challenge, the panel sees it as symptomatic of a broader industry issue. “More people should be stepping aside today,” Jason argues. “VCs, executives, founders. Most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade. I genuinely believe it across my ecosystem. I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today.” Rory adds context: “The pace of evolution is so fast. If you decide what I knew 6 months ago is still useful, you’re probably going to be wrong very quickly. That’s what I find the most stressful about right now.” The meta-lesson? Even the best firms are struggling to keep pace with AI, which means everyone else should be asking themselves hard questions about whether they’re still the right people for this moment. And Sequoia gets credit for one thing: ruthless decisiveness. “They did not do that fatal error of saying it’s someone’s turn so we’ll leave him in,” Rory notes. “They ruthlessly said, if we’re going to compete, we need these people, not those people.” Michael Burry made headlines (again) by shorting Nvidia and Palantir to the tune of $1.1 billion. Unlike most pundits who just discussed whether he’d be right, Jason actually did the math on what it takes to make money on these bets. “It brings home how hard a business it is to bet against AI capex,” Jason concludes. “You not just got to be right, but you got to be right on timing.” Rory’s take: “It’s easy to be roughly right. It’s very hard to imagine that the AI capex boom doesn’t have a significant correction. But going from that kind of armchair podcast statement to actually being able to make money on it — that’s damn hard.” The counterpoint to all this short-selling cynicism? The revenue is actually showing up. OpenAI is projected to hit $20B ARR this year, while Anthropic projects $70B ARR by 2028. The growth rates aren’t just holding — they’re accelerating. Harry drives this home: “Are we being overly British? Are we looking for a problem that’s not there? The revenue is showing up in billions.” The lesson: It’s intellectually easy to be a skeptic about AI valuations. It’s financially hard to make money being that skeptic. And meanwhile, the actual revenue keeps proving the bulls right. Few stories capture the AI revenue opportunity better than Gamma’s latest round. The company raised $100M at a $2.1B valuation, having hit $100M in revenue with just 50 people and 2 million users. Harry, Jason, and Rory are such a great combo. One of the top shows every single week. https://t.co/NB29EhA02T — Grant Lee (@thisisgrantlee) November 13, 2025 Jason and Team SaaStr are super-users and he walks through exactly how they use it at SaaStr: “Instead of sending sponsors the same dated prospectus, Gamma automatically pulls all of our data from Salesforce and our marketing automation system. It knows the exact number of leads and ROI. It knows who their competitors are and makes a fully dynamic piece of collateral in about 10 minutes.” Here’s the math that’s important: SaaStr pays $100/month for Gamma — $1,200 per year. That’s stealth TAM expansion. “How much do we spend for Google Slides? Zero. It’s built in. How much do we spend on PowerPoint? I don’t even know where my key is to Microsoft Office. So it is a stealth TAM expansion.” But Jason’s most important insight is about what’s coming next: “The lame thing about co-pilots is they were just tools. When the AI is part of your team for real, not VC talk, the amount of revenue that it’s accessible is so high.” He distinguishes between AI as a tool versus AI as a team member: “It is sufficiently autonomous, knowledgeable and powerful to complete material high-value tasks on its own with some daily discussions just like on our team. The level of autonomy and capability — Gamma, go into my Google Calendar, create prospectuses and sales collateral for all 20 sales calls this week, pull all the data from Salesforce and HubSpot and Marketo, review once, and distribute to the team.” But there’s a warning embedded in Gamma’s story too. Canva now has a Gamma clone that’s “pretty good.” The competitive response time has collapsed from years to months or even weeks. This leads to one of the episode’s most important debates… This might be the single most important strategic question facing every seed and Series A investor right now. And the panel doesn’t fully agree on the answer. Jason frames the problem: “The quality of clones is only going up. I can think of one investment I’ve made that has had five clones in the first 30 days, including one from a cloud leader. The ability of AI to enable us to clone better stuff faster — Canva is borderline competitive with Gamma and wasn’t when Cliff was on the show. What does seed investing mean when you might see 10 better versions in 30 days?” Rory’s response: “I don’t think you can have a major defensibility at the seed or even frankly the stage we’re investing at. The defensibility theorem emerges at scale. Once you become the anointed winner, once a market coalesces and there’s two or three people, you know, it’s yours to lose.” But Rory pushes back on the idea that this makes seed investing impossible: “You just have to internalize the game you’re in. Awesome team, run fast, be superlative on technology, get your distribution early, and then rely on that. You can’t be anointed the winner up front. Get over it everybody.” Jason’s concern is economic: “Is that okay at 50 post for a seed round? Do the outcomes justify it? If I’ve got to spread $5 million checks around at 50 post, it’s tougher.” Harry asks the critical question: “Are we getting paid for the risk?” He notes that even at the Series B stage, it’s unclear who will win in many categories. Looking at customer support AI companies that have raised Series B rounds: “I got no idea who the winner is in that category and I don’t think anyone does to be honest.” The debate crystallizes around whether you can know enough at the B to justify the valuation: Rory’s view: By the Series B, you can see rank order. “Once the horses are running and once they round the first furlong, you can actually see the rank order of where they’re running in a way you can’t at the early A.” Harry’s counter: Looking at codegen — even with clear leaders like Cursor emerging, you have Codex making incredible ground, Claude Code advancing, and Replit and Lovable coming from different angles. “I think that’s still entirely up for grabs.” The practical implication: This uncertainty means one of two things: Jason’s conclusion: “Maybe you need 40 deals at $5M. That’s $200M for first checks. $200M for reserves. That’s $400M. $100M for fees and backup. I need at least $500M for my little seed fund to make the math work.” Amid all the complexity, the panel crystalizes a simple framework for what actually works in AI investing right now. DataDog crushed earnings, with stock up 23% and $15M+ in AI-native customers. Why? They’re selling to the people making AI, and as those companies grow, DataDog sells more too. Jason: “The AI leaders, the hyperscalers — they’re starting to buy like classic B2B companies. They’re recycling the same people in procurement. So if you’re attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Rory adds: “DataDog is a core piece of compute infrastructure and these hyperscalers are the most compute-intensive companies that have ever been known. If you’re selling compute stuff, you should be having a great quarter. If you’re selling routers, switches, interconnects, whatever it takes to stand up Stargate — you’re going to be golden.” “Where are you replacing humans for real?” Jason asks. “Where are you going to go in and reduce the headcount that vendor needs by half?” This is the Replit story — Jason deployed 20+ AI agents that generate significant revenue while requiring substantial daily management but far less human headcount than traditional approaches. The key distinction: “Most of the time, ‘replacing humans’ is a story. But when it’s real, when the AI agent is sufficiently autonomous to complete material high-value tasks, that’s when you’re actually part of the team, not just a tool.” “You have a third option,” Jason concedes. “Use AI to massively displace an incumbent and steal all the revenue. In fact, that’s the history of B2B software mostly. I just don’t know how many of our public leaders are in a place to steal their own revenue.” But he’s skeptical this is as compelling as the first two: “There’s like 400 AI CRM startups out there all saying they’re going to eat HubSpot’s and Salesforce’s lunch. That’s not exciting to me as an investment. That’s much less exciting than truly replacing 90% of your GTM team.” If you’re not doing one of these three things, you’re probably not going to see explosive growth. Using AI to make your product better? That’s table stakes now, not a competitive advantage. One of the most tactically useful segments came when Harry shared a founder interaction that frustrated him: the company said they wanted to “run a process” despite Harry offering terms they’d stated they wanted. Harry’s reaction: “I said, listen, if you’re running a process, you’re either optimizing for price or partner selection. I’m giving you a great price today that you said you wanted, which means you’re not optimizing for price. Which is just saying you think you can get better than me. In which case, just tell me straight.” Rory sees both sides: “From the founder’s side, they’re correct. I see more failed financings because they didn’t run a process than because they did.” But then he makes a critical distinction: “What typically happens when people ‘don’t run a process’ is someone comes in, says they’re interested, and the founder shares information serially to someone not yet ready to commit. That’s a mistake. That’s running an accidental process.” Jason has the most nuanced take on optimal strategy: “The best founders cultivate enough interest with enough good VCs that if they hit the number, they just send an email. Harry, I’m thinking about raising around before the end of the year. And Harry could say, I’ll give you a term sheet today. And the right answer is: ‘I love you, Harry. I’m not ready today. I will be ready at the end of the year.'” The key insight: “The optimal way to run it is for everyone already to want to invest for real without games before you open your data room. The best run processes don’t require a data room. Not a traditional one. Only one for diligence.” Rory synthesizes: “The best run processes don’t feel like a process, but they are. If a founder is smartly nurturing relationships, keeping people broadly informed, then tries to time the interest such that when they’re ready to put their hand up, there’s three people who are primed and ready to go — that is perfection itself.” But here’s the brutal caveat: Jason points out that this only works if you have stellar numbers. “You’re either YC, Neo, South Park Commons, got something, get funded — or who the hell is going to find you? You better be hot AI-native with top-quartile venture growth or you ain’t getting funded.” Harry shares a data point that proves this: A company that grew from $400K to $3M ARR (classic enterprise SaaS, 10x growth) had 120 meetings and got one term sheet at $10M on $40M post. That’s 12x revenue for a 10x grower — which five years ago would have generated five term sheets from top firms. “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes,” Jason concludes. “You’re either Captain Obvious getting funded, or you’re not seeing it anywhere.” While DataDog surged 23%, Duolingo crashed 25% in the same week. The contrast illustrates everything about what’s working and what’s not in AI. Jason’s diagnosis: “Duolingo has the ‘wrong’ kind of AI. Duolingo is using AI to make its product better. Hooray. Every single portfolio company at scale should be using AI by this point to make your product better. This is not 2023. You don’t get any kudos for sprinkling AI dust on your product.” Rory pushes back slightly on behalf of consumer apps: “If you’re an infrastructure company, you can co-attach to compute. If you’re a new AI apps company, you are using that compute. But if you’re like Duolingo — preexisting — what you can do is co-adopt the technology.” But Jason sees a bigger problem: “Duolingo took money from Berlitz and all these language schools. Hooray, you did that. Now, where are you going to disrupt humans? This is your job. You already disrupted those humans. Unfortunately, they’re gone. Where’s the next level of human disruption?” Rory makes an interesting point about where the AI opportunity in education actually is: LLM learning is equivalent to one-on-one human tutoring. What AI should enable in education is allowing everyone to get one-on-one learning instead of group-based learning. But there’s no budget in K-12 to give every kid a customized tutor. The market is adults wanting to learn a second language for business who would pay for a one-on-one coach — a niche market. Jason’s framework applies here too: “If you’re not removing humans from the equation, you’re going to be heavily discounted. You’re either getting money from compute or you’re getting money because you’re using AI to replace humans. Otherwise, congratulations on your 14% growth.” One exchange revealed how different the panel’s approaches are to portfolio construction — and why both can work. Harry revealed his team’s meeting load: “With my four investing partners, we have 80 net new companies that we meet in person per week.” Jason’s response: “I would resign. I would give you all my carry back. I sold my companies because I didn’t want to spend my life in meetings. I’ll do one a week, two max.” But Jason’s critique cuts deeper than meeting volume: “When you do 200 deals between your team, you got to meet 500, 600, 700 founders a year. I don’t want to meet 500 founders a year. Unless you’re great, you’re going to blow my mind. But if you’re not, I’m gonna start yawning about 15 minutes into this meeting.” Rory defends the high-volume approach: “Even on an okay deal, you learn nuances about a specific market from the one-on-one that you wouldn’t get from the presentation. The person inside living it every day has a crucial kernel of knowledge that you just can’t access any other way.” But the conversation reveals a deeper truth about fund construction: The Small Fund, High Multiple Approach (Hummingbird-style): The Large Fund, Maintained Ownership Approach (Lightspeed-style): Rory’s key insight: “Both are great outcomes. They’re just different ways to play the game. The interesting thing is both outcomes have great outcomes for the GP. But if you only have $1 to play with as an LP, you want the small fund 10x. If you have to deploy $100M, you have to do the big fund. The high small fund accept the follow-on dilution but make a marvelous return is the compelling product for the marginal dollar.” Speaking of Hummingbird, their Billion to One investment deserves its own section because it represents what’s possible when everything goes right. Hummingbird did their first bio deal in Billion to One and now has an $800M position on the IPO — likely representing an 800x+ return on their initial investment from a sub-$100M fund. Harry marvels: “You want freaking great venture returns? Credit due. Amazing.” But Jason asks the tactical question every seed investor should be asking: “How did they collect the capital as a seed manager to deploy enough to maintain the ownership? I don’t see how I’ll ever own 18% of something at IPO ever again.” The answers are telling: Rory makes the crucial point: “You can accept some dilution and optimize for multiple rather than ownership. If you put in $4M and get diluted from 20% to 12% but it’s a $5B exit, you’re a hero.” Jason counters with what’s exciting about capital efficient outcomes: “Navan at $4.5B, Billion to One at $5B — the power of capital efficiency and running lean delivers superior investor returns despite smaller headline valuations.” The lesson: Small funds generating 10x+ returns by accepting dilution but betting on capital-efficient companies may be the optimal strategy for seed investors who don’t have the deployment capacity of mega-funds. Pulling all these threads together reveals several uncomfortable truths: 1. The Middle Class of Fundable Companies is Gone “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes,” Jason states flatly. The classic SaaS triple-triple-double-double company? A company growing from $400K to $3M ARR would have had five term sheets from good firms. Now: 120 meetings, one term sheet. 2. Most People from the Last Decade Should Step Aside This isn’t ageism — it’s pace of change. “The most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade,” Jason argues. “I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today. We don’t even need half the VCs we have today for the AI world.” 3. Diversification Matters More, Not Less With increased variance in outcomes and compressed time to clone, the math says diversification is critical. But diversification at seed prices requires massive funds or acceptance of lower ownership. 4. There Are Only Three Ways to Win Attach to compute budgets, replace human headcount, or massively displace incumbents. If you’re not doing one of those three things, you’re probably building a slow-growth SaaS company in a world that doesn’t want those anymore. 5. Capital Efficiency Delivers Superior Returns Billion to One at $5B and Navan at $4.5B generated better investor returns than most $20B+ outcomes because they raised less capital. The lesson: optimize for investor returns, not headline valuations. 6. The Best Fundraises Don’t Feel Like Processes Cultivate relationships over months. Have 3-4 investors ready to commit before you formally raise. Send one email and get multiple term sheets. That’s the optimal path. 7. If You’re Not Excited, You Should Retire Jason’s most important point: “If this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. This is the first time software has gotten better since the three of us met. If you’re not incredibly excited, retire. No shame in that. Put the rest into NASDAQ — you’re going to make more than most VC funds anyway.” The panel is clear about what’s coming: “This year was AI works. Next year is AI is part of your team.” That transition — from AI as a tool making you more efficient to AI as an actual member of your team with autonomy, knowledge, and capability — is where the revenue explosion happens. Jason’s final thought captures the optimism underlying all the tough talk: “If you’re not incredibly excited right now, if this isn’t one of the most exciting and stressful times simultaneously, you’re missing it. This is a great enormous mega trend. It’s the biggest mega trend maybe since the early days of the internet. Leaning into it is the only sensible thing to do, and playing against it is dumb as rocks.” The old playbook is broken. The new playbook is being written in real-time. And the investors who figure it out — whether through small concentrated funds like Hummingbird or large diversified portfolios like Harry’s approach — will capture the extraordinary returns available in this moment. Everyone else? Maybe it’s time to buy that beach house. On Venture Evolution: “The most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade. I genuinely believe it across my ecosystem. I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today.” — Jason Lemkin “The pace of evolution is so fast. If you decide what I knew 6 months ago is still useful, you’re probably going to be wrong very quickly. That’s what I find the most stressful about right now.” — Rory O’Driscoll On AI Investment Strategy: “Tools are great when the AI is part of your team for real, not VC talk. The amount of revenue that it’s accessible is so high.” — Jason Lemkin “Sell to the people who are making AI and if they grow, you’ll sell more too.” — Jason Lemkin On Defensibility: “You just can’t take that early first month explosion as seriously as you used to. It’s not as defensible.” — Harry Stebbings “I don’t think you can have a major defensibility at the seed or even frankly the stage we’re investing at. The defensibility theorem emerges at scale.” — Rory O’Driscoll On Market Timing: “It’s easy to be roughly right. It’s very hard to imagine that the AI capex boom doesn’t have a significant correction. But going from that kind of armchair podcast statement to actually being able to make money on it — that’s damn hard.” — Rory O’Driscoll On Fundraising: “The best run processes don’t require a data room.

You’re either getting funded or you ain’t seeing it anywhere.” — Jason Lemkin On Taking Action: “If this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. If you’re not incredibly excited, retire. No shame in that. You had a great run.

Title: Tucker to Release Information on Butler Assassination – Here’s Our List of What is Missing
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4352518/posts
Time Published: 2025-11-14T17:20:13Z
Full Content:
Skip to comments. Posted on 11/14/2025 9:20:13 AM PST by Red Badger Tucker Carlson to announce his findings related to the assassination attempt of President Trump in Butler on Friday night. Here is a list of items that are still outstanding. We’ve been saying since the assassination attempt that many questions are still open. Bannon shared Tucker’s tweet on GETTR. On Twitter and X, a similar report was made. We really don’t know anything about Thomas Crooks, the alleged assassin of President Trump in Bultler, PA, on July 13, 2024. Tucker will be addressing this in a show on Friday. Wall Street Apes shares this: BREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces he is releasing evidence tomorrow proving the FBI is lying about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania by Thomas Crooks Joe Rogan and Elon Musk pointed out the INSANE inconsistencies – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Here is a list of items that are still outstanding. We’ve been saying since the assassination attempt that many questions are still open. Bannon shared Tucker’s tweet on GETTR. On Twitter and X, a similar report was made. We really don’t know anything about Thomas Crooks, the alleged assassin of President Trump in Bultler, PA, on July 13, 2024. Tucker will be addressing this in a show on Friday. Wall Street Apes shares this: BREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces he is releasing evidence tomorrow proving the FBI is lying about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania by Thomas Crooks Joe Rogan and Elon Musk pointed out the INSANE inconsistencies – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon.

Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon.

Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME).

The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt.

I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not.

And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret?

Title: How the Grayscale IPO changes the cost to hold $35 billion crypto ETF shares
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/how-grayscale-going-public-changes-the-cost-to-hold-35-billion-etf-shares/

Grayscale reported $318.7 million in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, down from $397.9 million in the same period of 2024. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Grayscale filed an S-1 form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Nov. 13 to list Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol GRAY. The firm manages approximately $35 billion across more than 40 crypto products, including spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. As a public company, Grayscale will have to disclose more financials and face shareholder pressure, which could influence future fee decisions and product strategy. The filing does not specify share count or pricing range for the proposed offering. Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities, Jefferies, and Cantor will serve as lead managing bookrunners. Grayscale reported $318.7 million in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, down from $397.9 million in the same period of 2024. The company posted net income of $203.3 million through September 2025 compared with $223.7 million a year earlier. Operating margin reached 65.7% in the recent nine-month period. The firm’s weighted-average management fee declined to 1.39% through September 2025 from 1.67% in the prior-year period, reflecting competitive pressure from lower-cost ETF entrants, including BlackRock and Fidelity. Average assets under management slipped to $30.6 billion from $31.8 billion year-over-year. Full-year 2024 results showed revenue of $506.2 million and net income of $282.1 million, down from $512.7 million and $325 million, respectively, in 2023. The company attributed the decline to reduced management fees, outflows, and distributions. The offering employs a dual-class share structure, giving Digital Currency Group, Grayscale’s parent company, 10 votes per Class B share compared with one vote per Class A share. DCG will retain approximately 70% of total voting power after the IPO through its Class B holdings, which carry no economic rights. Each Class A share will receive one vote and full economic participation. The structure qualifies Grayscale as a “controlled company” under NYSE rules, exempting it from certain corporate governance requirements. The Class B super-voting rights terminate when DCG’s ownership falls below 20% of total shares outstanding. The IPO does not alter the legal structure, custody arrangements, or operations of Grayscale’s existing trusts and ETFs. Fund assets remain held by third-party custodians under separate trust agreements. The company completed a reorganization into a Delaware holding structure earlier in 2025, which it stated would not materially affect trust operations. Net proceeds from the offering will be used to purchase membership interests from existing owners in Grayscale Operating, rather than funding capital expenditures. The transaction converts private ownership stakes into publicly tradable equity without requiring the injection of new capital into fund operations or altering sponsor fee arrangements. Grayscale reserved a portion of IPO shares for eligible investors in its Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) through a directed share program. Participants must have held GBTC or ETHE shares as of Oct. 28 and complete pre-registration by Nov. 24. The program does not guarantee allocations, and shares purchased through it face no lock-up restrictions. The public listing will subject Grayscale to quarterly and annual reporting requirements, providing ETF investors with increased visibility into the sponsor’s financial condition, litigation exposure, and product concentration. The registration statement indicates that future fee decisions and product expansion plans will face scrutiny from public equity holders alongside existing competitive pressure in the ETF market.

Title: Crystal Dynamics announces new layoffs, and it's worrying for the next Tomb Raider game

Crystal Dynamics doesn’t seem to be in a good shape. Indeed, yesterday, the studio announced the layoff of just under 30 people on LinkedIn, which is worrying for the upcoming Tomb Raider game. While Tomb Raider fans eagerly await new information about the next title in this franchise, Crystal Dynamics unveiled a rather worrying statement yesterday on LinkedIn: "Today we've made the difficult but necessary decision to reorganize Crystal Dynamics' studios and teams. As a result, we've parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation. Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition.” And that's not all, because Crystal Dynamics claimed that these layoffs are essential for the future of the studio as well as for optimizing the development of the next Tomb Raider game. However, this situation may seem alarming to some. Indeed, there have already been layoffs in August at the company, and in October, some further dismissals at Amazon. Thus, it is difficult to imagine that this new game will not be affected by these decisions made by Crystal Dynamics. But it is also possible that its production goes well, and that it could be unveiled before the end of 2025. As a reminder, all we know is that it will be a single-player game and that Unreal Engine 5 will be used. Some rumors mention an open world, which could offer many possibilities to the players.

Title: Nvidia Reports Earnings Next Week. How Big of a Blowout Will It Be?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Monster Ztudio / Shutterstock.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands as the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence (AI) chips, powering data centers and enabling breakthroughs in generative AI. Over the past few years, the company has transformed from a graphics specialist into a tech powerhouse, with its stock surging amid the AI boom. Over the past five years, Nvidia has beaten Wall Street’s earnings estimates 90% of the time, sometimes by more than 30%, showcasing consistent outperformance. In the last four quarters, however, the chipmaker has averaged a beat of only 6.5%, likely due to analysts getting better at predicting its results. Investors are now laser-focused on Nvidia’s upcoming third-quarter results, set for release after market close on Nov. 19. Expectations run high, with Wall Street forecasting $54.83 billion in revenue and $1.25 in adjusted earnings per share — up 56% and 54% year-over-year, respectively. This pressure mounts as “whisper numbers,” the unofficial higher estimates circulating among traders, suggest Nvidia must deliver an even bigger surprise to avoid disappointing the market. Any miss could trigger a selloff, especially given its role as a bellwether for the broader AI sector. Nvidia’s success in the recent quarter likely stems from its commanding position in the AI ecosystem. As the primary supplier of GPUs for training large language models, the company has capitalized on demand from hyperscalers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In the prior quarter, data center revenue hit record levels, driven by Blackwell chip ramp-ups and partnerships with AI innovators. These factors could push Q3 revenue toward or beyond the guided $54 billion, with analysts projecting 54% growth. On the bottom line, improved margins from economies of scale and software integrations, such as CUDA, may boost adjusted earnings to around $1.25 per share. Beyond hardware, Nvidia’s Omniverse platform for simulations has gained traction in industries like automotive and robotics, adding diversified revenue streams. Recent wins include expanded deals with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for cloud AI infrastructure, potentially contributing millions in incremental sales. Overall, these tailwinds position Nvidia for another strong showing, reinforcing its market cap lead on the S&P 500. Despite the momentum, setbacks could temper results. Nvidia faces ongoing restrictions on its ability to sell advanced AI chips to China. This “hangover” persists, with no H20 chip revenue in Q3, as CEO Jensen Huang recently confirmed, and no expectation for that to change. While the company still sells less advanced tech, such as gaming and automotive chips, to Chinese customers, the loss of high-margin data center business — previously a key growth driver — may cap upside. Analysts estimate this could shave several billion off potential revenue. Additionally, hedge fund manager Michael Burry’s bearish put options on Nvidia, revealed last week, sparked a 7.2% stock drop, signaling concerns over AI hype and valuation risks (Burry just announced he was closing his Scion fund and returning investor funds because he no longer understood AI market valuations). Broader market dynamics, including competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and a coming cash crunch, add uncertainty. If demand softens or supply chain issues arise, these could pressure margins and lead to a guidance miss for Q4, where Wall Street expects $61.33 billion in revenue. Nvidia’s earnings next week could indeed be a blowout, given its 90.5% beat rate over the last 21 quarters and robust AI demand. However, smaller recent beats and China restrictions raise the chance of a negative surprise if results fall short of whisper numbers or its guidance disappoints. In the last three earnings announcements in February, May, and August, Nvidia’s stock has briefly declined twice afterward, underscoring potential post-report volatility. Long-term investors might buy before results if they are confident in Nvidia’s fundamentals — which otherwise seem solid — but risk-averse ones might wait for clarity on guidance. The chipmaker’s stock is down 12% from its all-time hit above $212 at the end of October, and its shares have fallen in the past few sessions. CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) just shocked the market with news of a data center partner’s buildout delay and we may see other AI stocks run into similar situations as the race for scarce resources heats up. The prudent choice just might be to take a wait-and-see approach before diving in.

Title: "Our Democracy" (I'm Sure)

Full Content:
By now, whenever you hear anyone invoke the phrase “saving our democracy,” that should be a signal that they are intent on destroying this republic, and with that, your natural rights to free speech, economic liberty, and public order. What began in 2016 as a simple, high-level plot to take out Donald Trump and squash Trumpism — a grassroots revolt against those very high-level DC insiders —turned sharply in 2017 into a long-running cover-up operation that spawned a multiplying cycle of seditions, treasons, and betrayals of the public — as the insiders desperately tried to evade culpability for each previous act — and finally blossomed into a rolling coup with crypto-Jacobin overtones as the insiders’ useful idiots were recruited to run with the ball of color revolution. For those who can’t quite wrap their minds around this game, a color revolution is the surreptitious overthrow of an elected government by concealed parties. Neocons in the US State Department developed the practice of color revolution on many countries over the years. Mr. Obama added a layer of gnostic Marxists to the personnel mix at State, and these wannabe revolutionaries built a fantastic matrix of NGOs outside State to marshal the useful idiots with jobs and salaries. The NGOs, in turn, were connected to international moneybags, with strange agendas of their own such as the megalomanic climate change crusader Bill Gates and George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, which funds anarchist district attorneys, the defense of election fraud, mass illegal migration, internet censorship, and money-flows into Antifa, the Left’s street fighters. Clusterfuck Nation is a reader-supported publication. Subscribe to this blog on Patreon or right here on Substack! This blog is sponsored this week by Vaulted, an online mobile web app for investing in allocated and deliverable physical gold. To learn more visit: Vaulted.com The motives of these players might appear murky, but at this point they can be boiled down to 1) staying out of jail, and 2) retaining control of their empires. Hillary Clinton, for instance, surely wants to stay out of jail for her RussiaGate caper, and retain the ill-gotten lucre of the Clinton Foundation she lives off. At 95, George Soros himself is probably beyond caring about all this, but his son Alex, 38, carries on, and recently cemented his alliance with the Clinton Foundation by marrying the former Mrs. Anthony Wiener, Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s long-time wing-gal. The Democratic Party plays an increasingly curious part in this rolling coup as all its efforts look evermore insane and self-extinguishing — the bootless government shutdown being the latest exercise. The party can no longer meaningfully represent organized labor — since labor moved to faraway lands — so it attempted to replace that earnest bond with fronting for women and minorities. This has resulted in two problems. 1) women taking over the actual machinery of the party has transformed mere politics into never-ending psychodrama and boosted the amplitude of political dirty-fighting to dangerous new levels; and 2) cultivating minority groups has led to an orgy of race-and-gender hustles that amount to gigantic racketeering operations (i.e., making money dishonestly). All of that sound, fury, and roguery is now dedicated only to staving off the party’s collapse and thwarting Mr. Trump’s attempt to restore something like regular order in public affairs, which the Democratic Party calls “authoritarianism.” Regular order is something that healthy male psychology takes an interest in, since it entails defense of the culture, in this case, Western Civ and its heritage. That implies the uses of strength as opposed to the stratagems of weakness. It must acknowledge and rely on classic virtues such as fortitude, prudence, and a preference for what is — as opposed to wishes and fantasies. Psychodrama dispenses with all that for the sake of emotional gratification, often mis-characterized as empathy or caring. It can transform easily into sadism — as you can see now with the calls for violence and murder against Trump-adjacent persons. Meanwhile, be aware that the cries for “saving our democracy” come from the people opposed to regular order in elections, that is, voter ID, voting on election day only, with results reported out at day’s end, paper ballots and no electronic counting machines, and no mail-in ballots (except for people out of the country on election day). All of these stipulations are observed in other nations of Western Civ, and beyond, even in lands where people go about half-clothed. The current psychodrama, of course, is the latest installment of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The Democrats are flogging it with Wile E. Coyote zeal. I suspect it is an Acme booby trap for the ages and it is being carefully laid by Mr. Trump, the Roadrunner, to blow up un the Dems’ faces when all the documents are finally sorted out. Anyway, it has nothing to do with the real-world problems that the US faces, such as runaway financialization of the economy, a broken medical system, mass job layoffs, the collapse of education, surging mental illness, the drug plague, and the sinking middle-class. We’re entering a new phase in the ongoing color revolution, the coup against America, and it’s liable to be the final phase in which all the mystery gets wrung out, the motives are revealed, and the players are correctly sorted and labeled according to their deeds. No new psychodrama will avail to stop what’s coming. I’ll be doing two book events Saturday, Nov 15 in New York’s Capital District to talk up my new novel, Look, I’m Gone. The first: 11:00 a.m., Market Block Books at 290 River in Troy, NY. The second 3:00 p.m. at The Book House of Stuyvesant Plaza, 1475 Western Avenue in Albany, NY. Hope to see you there.

BySiladitya Ray, Forbes Staff andTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Nvidia and Tesla headlined broader gains across tech stocks on Friday afternoon, leading a rebound for major indexes a day after markets posted their worst declines in more than a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped roughly 100 points (0.2%), while the S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Nasdaq added 0.7% as of Friday afternoon, after each index fell more than 1% earlier in the day and dropped 1.6%, 1.6% and 2.2% on Thursday, respectively, in their largest single-day losses since October. Stocks recovered on Friday following a widespread rout on Thursday, during which investors dumped AI stocks amid general economic uncertainty, after the U.S. ended the longest government shutdown in history, with added concerns the Federal Reserve may not lower interest rates next month. Markets also appeared to react to the White House announcing that employment and inflation data for October and September would be at least partially released, after previously the data would “likely never” be published, as economists projected inflation to remain high while the labor market likely deteriorated further. Nvidia rose 1.5% to around $189, adding to a 1.6% increase for Tesla, after both megacap stocks slumped 0.4% and 2.4% earlier in the day, respectively. Other stocks turned positive by Friday afternoon, including AMD (up 1.5%), Palantir (1.9%), Broadcom (0.9%), Apple (0.8%), Microsoft (1.1%) and Intel (0.1%), among others, while Amazon (down 0.3%) and Alphabet (0.4%) remained in the negative. UnitedHealth Group headlined losses across the Dow as shares traded down 3%, followed by Nike (2.5%), American Express (1.7%) and Walt Disney (1.7%). The cryptocurrency market was also hit by a selloff, with the price of bitcoin dropping below $96,000 for the first time in six months before paring back earlier losses. The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is down more than 6% over the past 24 hours, falling to around $96,031 after earlier falling to as low as $94,592, the lowest level for the leading cryptocurrency since May. Ether, the token with the second-largest market cap, dropped to $3,130, down more than 10.3% over the past 24 hours. Other major cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Solana’s SOL and Binance’s BNB, are down 8.8%, 10.5% and 6.2% respectively. Crypto-linked stocks similarly declined, including Strategy (down 3.9%) and Coinbase (1.3%). It appears the broader crypto market is reeling from traders lowering odds of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, as key economic data remains delayed, leading to investors pressuring riskier assets, according to Bloomberg. Liquidity has also plummeted: Exchange-traded funds investing in bitcoin reported new outflows of about $870 million on Thursday, the second-largest withdrawal since they were introduced in January 2024, according to CoinGlass

Title: Global Biofertilizers Market to Double in Size by 2030 - Asia-Pacific to Register the Fastest Growth at 13.5% CAGR
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/14/3188235/28124/en/Global-Biofertilizers-Market-to-Double-in-Size-by-2030-Asia-Pacific-to-Register-the-Fastest-Growth-at-13-5-CAGR.html

November 14, 2025 07:38 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Biofertilizers Market - Types, Microorganisms and Applications" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The biofertilizers market is experiencing strong growth, expected to reach US$2.6 billion in 2024 and surpass US$5.1 billion by 2030 with a CAGR of 12.3%. This growth is propelled by expanding organic farming, environmental concerns about chemical fertilizers, and increasing demand for pesticide-free produce. Government incentives, national sustainability programs, and technical advancements in microbial formulation and precision agriculture also contribute to this upward trend. The burgeoning organic food sector, coupled with greater awareness of soil regeneration and sustainable practices like micro-irrigation, is accelerating market expansion, notably in Asia Pacific, Europe, and South America. Regional Market Insights North America, the leading region with a 36.8% market share in 2024, benefits from advanced farming practices, regulatory support, and growing consumer demand for organic produce. The U.S. spearheads regional growth due to USDA programs and precision agriculture, encouraging farmers to adopt biofertilizers for enhanced soil fertility and improved crop resilience. Conversely, Asia Pacific is anticipated to exhibit the fastest growth with a CAGR of 13.5% from 2024 to 2030, driven by population growth, increased food demand, and a shift towards organic farming. India and China lead this trend, bolstered by government subsidies and innovative nutrient management systems. Market Segmentation by Type Nitrogen fixation holds the largest share, contributing to 70.3% of the market in 2024, owing to its effectiveness in boosting soil fertility and crop yields. Biofertilizers like Rhizobium and Azotobacter enhance nutrient absorption, making them preferred solutions for nitrogen-deficient soils. Meanwhile, the phosphate-solubilizing segment is set for rapid growth at a 13.3% CAGR from 2024 to 2030, addressing phosphorus lock-up issues in soils and improving crop quality. Microorganism Type Analysis The Rhizobium segment dominates with a 26.2% share in 2024, owing to its symbiotic nitrogen-fixing capabilities with leguminous crops, reducing synthetic fertilizer reliance and improving yields. In contrast, the Mycorrhiza segment is likely to experience the fastest growth at 13.3% CAGR from 2024 to 2030, due to its role in nutrient absorption and plant resistance enhancement. Application Insights In 2024, seed treatment emerges as the top application, accounting for 61.2% of the market due to its efficacy in boosting seed germination and nutrient uptake. Meanwhile, soil treatment is projected to witness the fastest growth at a 12.8% CAGR from 2024 to 2030, driven by the need to improve soil fertility and agricultural productivity. Market by Crop Type In 2024, cereals and grains command the largest segment with a 46.2% share, driven by high global demand for organic staples and extensive cultivation areas. Alternatively, the oilseeds and pulses segment is expected to grow the fastest at 12.9% CAGR, spurred by rising organic oil demand and government biofertilizer promotion.

Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. CNET's top budget virtual reality headset is even cheaper right now, with some retailers offering instant credit, too. Get it while you can. The Meta Quest 3S is on sale now. Black Friday is coming up fast and it's an excellent chance to pick up all sorts of tech. While it's great to stock up on essentials when they're on sale, we always like to peek at a few luxuries, too. They're just easier to justify when the price is right. Right now, that means it's a great time to think about getting a good virtual reality headset. The Meta Quest 3S, which is already a fantastic value for the money, is on sale at Best Buy and Amazon. You can get the 128GB model with a game included for just $249 at Best Buy. If you want the 256GB model, the headset on its own is down to $330 plus a $50 credit thrown in at both of those retailers. This deal ends Sunday at Best Buy and we assume Amazon will follow, so you'll need to be quick if you want it. If you shop at Amazon, you won't get a discount on the 128GB model, nor does it come with any credit. However, the 256GB option includes Batman and it's $70 off, bringing it down to $330. Amazon is also throwing in a $50 credit that you can spend on anything at Amazon. If you're heading to Best Buy instead, you can save $50 on the 128GB model, plus it comes with The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners game. And best of all, Best Buy is throwing in a $50 gift card that you can spend in-store or online. Best Buy has the same $70 off offer on the 256GB model and is also throwing in the $50 gift card with this model, too. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money. The Meta Quest 3S has improved CPU and graphics, which makes it great for gamers. It also has a noticeably lighter design compared to the previous Quest 2 and it has approximately 3 hours of battery life. It's the budget version of the Quest 3 headset but it's like comparing the iPhone 17 to the iPhone 17 Pro -- the Pro version comes with added benefits but the basic version should serve all of your needs without breaking a virtual sweat. CNET's Scott Stein, VR expert, said in his review, "If you want a simple, fun entry ticket to VR at an amazing price, the Quest 3S is a really good upgraded device with a lot of headroom for mixed-reality evolution in the years to come. And if you're thinking of VR as a simple, fun everyday toy, and you're not wanting to spend too much, then the cheaper 3S is exactly where you want to be." Stein also labeled it as "by far the best value in VR," in his review. Virtual and augmented reality tech is constantly evolving but it's rarely cheap. Deals on headsets like the Meta Quest 3S don't pop up every day. If you've been wanting to invest in one of Meta's headsets, you should do it now while it's available at a lower-than-usual price.

Title: Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics announces yet another round of layoffs

A "difficult but necessary decision". Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has announced yet more layoffs at the studio, calling it a "difficult but necessary decision". In a post on LinkedIn, the studio said it has "parted ways" with just under 30 employees. These employees came from a variety of projects and departments within the company, with Crystal Dynamics calling it part of a restructuring "for our next generation". The developer additionally cited the next entry in the Tomb Raider series, which the studio is working on with Amazon, as part of the reason for its decision. "To our players - as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we've made these painful choices as a way to optimise the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future," it wrote. The post thanked those impacted by the layoffs for "their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways", adding: "We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition." Closing, Crystal Dynamics said it appreciated support during these changes at the studio, and that it "[looks] forward to sharing the team's amazing new work with the world in the future". This most recent wave of layoffs at the studio is at least the fourth in the last two years. In March, Crystal Dynamics laid off 17 "talented" staff members, again calling it a "difficult decision". In August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well".

Title: In the age of AI, CEOs quietly signal that layoffs are a badge of honor

Good morning. The wave of layoff announcements over the past few weeks is telling us something, most importantly, something that isn’t as easily measured as the number of jobs eliminated. It’s a change in the business environment. We can see this especially in big-company culture, a shift in what is OK and even virtuous to say out loud. Just maybe it’s signaling a new norm for employment and leadership. At its foundation, of course, is AI, regardless of whether companies say so directly. Over the past two weeks. we’ve learned that Amazon will eliminate 14,000 jobs with plans to eliminate more. Target will cut 1,800 corporate jobs, the company’s biggest layoff in a decade. United Parcel Service reported it had eliminated a staggering 48,000 jobs so far this year. Verizon will lay off 15,000. Nestlé said it will cut 16,000 jobs, mostly white-collar, in the next two years. Why all those mega-layoff announcements in just a few weeks? The usual reasons don’t explain it. The economy hasn’t suddenly changed significantly. Companies could conceivably be bracing for a recession, though it’s far from clear when or if that might arrive; the Wall Street Journal’s October survey of economists shows growth increasing next year. The traditional season for general “slimming-down” layoffs is December and January. The obvious explanation is AI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had already warned employees what was coming: “In the next few years,” he announced in June, Amazon “will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The recent announcement emphasized “removing layers.” Target COO Michael Fiddelke (becoming CEO in February) didn’t say “AI,” but he said the company had “too many layers and overlapping work” and would “accelerate technology.” JPMorgan Chase isn’t announcing layoffs but is taking a stance to avoid hiring even as the company expects to grow. The company has “a very strong bias against having the reflexive response to any given need to hire more people,” CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts recently. “There are definitely productivity tailwinds from AI.” Note the language. It isn’t defensive or apologetic. Just the opposite—it’s direct and confident. Among Fortune 500 CEOs, having fewer employees is becoming a badge of honor. Call the new model Human Capital Lite, or from employees’ perspective, Right Sizing, Left Standing. In January 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there’s this betting pool for the first year when there’s a one-person billion-dollar company—which would have been unimaginable without AI and now will happen.”We’re not there yet, and we may never go there. But we’re getting closer.—Geoff Colvin Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com White House considers reducing tariffs on food imports Following a series of losses to Democrats in midterm elections—whose candidates often highlighted cost-of-living issues—the White House is considering reducing tariffs on various food imports, including beef, bananas, coffee, and fruit. Trump receives BBC apology over January 6 speech The BBC has formally apologized for editing footage of President Trump’s speech on January 6 to make it look like he had urged his supporters to immediately invade the Capitol building. In fact, the edit spliced together remarks from the president’s speech that were far apart from each other and out of context.

Title: In the age of AI, CEOs quietly signal that layoffs are a badge of honor

Good morning. The wave of layoff announcements over the past few weeks is telling us something, most importantly, something that isn’t as easily measured as the number of jobs eliminated. It’s a change in the business environment. We can see this especially in big-company culture, a shift in what is OK and even virtuous to say out loud. Just maybe it’s signaling a new norm for employment and leadership. At its foundation, of course, is AI, regardless of whether companies say so directly. Over the past two weeks. we’ve learned that Amazon will eliminate 14,000 jobs with plans to eliminate more. Target will cut 1,800 corporate jobs, the company’s biggest layoff in a decade. United Parcel Service reported it had eliminated a staggering 48,000 jobs so far this year. Verizon will lay off 15,000. Nestlé said it will cut 16,000 jobs, mostly white-collar, in the next two years. Why all those mega-layoff announcements in just a few weeks? The usual reasons don’t explain it. The economy hasn’t suddenly changed significantly. Companies could conceivably be bracing for a recession, though it’s far from clear when or if that might arrive; the Wall Street Journal’s October survey of economists shows growth increasing next year. The traditional season for general “slimming-down” layoffs is December and January. The obvious explanation is AI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had already warned employees what was coming: “In the next few years,” he announced in June, Amazon “will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The recent announcement emphasized “removing layers.” Target COO Michael Fiddelke (becoming CEO in February) didn’t say “AI,” but he said the company had “too many layers and overlapping work” and would “accelerate technology.” JPMorgan Chase isn’t announcing layoffs but is taking a stance to avoid hiring even as the company expects to grow. The company has “a very strong bias against having the reflexive response to any given need to hire more people,” CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts recently. “There are definitely productivity tailwinds from AI.” Note the language. It isn’t defensive or apologetic. Just the opposite—it’s direct and confident. Among Fortune 500 CEOs, having fewer employees is becoming a badge of honor. Call the new model Human Capital Lite, or from employees’ perspective, Right Sizing, Left Standing. In January 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there’s this betting pool for the first year when there’s a one-person billion-dollar company—which would have been unimaginable without AI and now will happen.”We’re not there yet, and we may never go there. But we’re getting closer.—Geoff Colvin Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com White House considers reducing tariffs on food imports Following a series of losses to Democrats in midterm elections—whose candidates often highlighted cost-of-living issues—the White House is considering reducing tariffs on various food imports, including beef, bananas, coffee, and fruit. Trump receives BBC apology over January 6 speech The BBC has formally apologized for editing footage of President Trump’s speech on January 6 to make it look like he had urged his supporters to immediately invade the Capitol building. In fact, the edit spliced together remarks from the president’s speech that were far apart from each other and out of context. The BBC is hoping that Trump won’t now sue the corporation for defamation.

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. Verizon could soon be the latest tech company to announce a mass layoff. The carrier will cut around 15,000 jobs next week, The Wall Street Journal reports. The news arrives amid stiff competition for Verizon; it lost 7,000 postpaid customers in the last quarter, while T-Mobile added 1 million and AT&T gained 405,000. The report also arrives just over a month after Dan Schulman was appointed as the new CEO. The former PayPal CEO had served on Verizon's board for seven years before taking over as the chief executive in early October. "Verizon is at a critical juncture," Schulman said at the time. "We are going to maximize our value propositions, reduce our cost to serve, and optimize our capital allocation to delight our customers, and deliver sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders." Verizon had about 100,000 employees in February, and cutting 15,000 would mark the largest job reduction in the company's history, according to WSJ. While most of the job cuts will come through layoffs, others will result from franchising stores. Around 180–200 stores will be franchised, meaning people working there will no longer be on Verizon's payroll. With the move, Verizon joins the long list of tech companies trimming their workforces significantly this year. Intel announced a reduction of 15% of its workforce in July, and Amazon just cut 14,000 jobs last month. While expense management and restructuring have been cited as reasons by Verizon and Intel, Amazon has pinned the blame on employee culture. Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Title: Crystal Dynamics announces third round of layoffs this year, 30 workers affected

Time Published: 2025-11-14T08:54:59Z
Full Content:
Decision made to "optimise the continued development" of Tomb Raider and future projects "as the realities of the industry continue to evolve" Crystal Dynamics has announced a third round of layoffs this year, affecting 30 employees "across various departments and projects." In a post shared on LinkedIn, the developer said it needed to "optimise the continued development of [its] flagship Tomb Raider game" and future projects "as the realities of the industry continue to evolve." Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider game was announced in 2022, when it signed a partnership with Amazon Games to publish the title. "Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways," the studio wrote. "We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support during this transition." It added: "We appreciate the continued support of our players, our colleagues, and our partners during this transition and look forward to sharing the team's amazing new work with the world in the future." In August, Crystal Dynamics announced an unspecified amount of workers were made redundant. It cited "evolving business conditions" for the decision, which was made to ensure the "long-term health of [its] studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." This came after the first round of layoffs this year in March, which affected 17 employees. At the time, the developer said the reason was to "better align [its] current business and the studio's future success." Crystal Dynamics was also the co-developer of the Perfect Dark reboot with The Initiative. The latter was closed and the game was cancelled as part of larger layoffs at Microsoft. These redundancies affected several divisions at Microsoft Gaming, including King, ZeniMax, Raven Software, Turn 10, and Blizzard. Rare's Everwild was also cancelled. In September 2023, 10 people were laid off at Crystal Dynamics following restructuring at its parent company Embracer.

November 13, 2025 23:57 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, today announced its two Explorer-class spacecraft for NASA and the University of California Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory have been successfully launched, beginning their journey to Mars to study the Red Planet’s magnetosphere. NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission was launched by Blue Origin on November 13, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 03:55 p.m. EST. Rocket Lab has successfully established contact with the spacecraft and they are generating power. Now in orbit, the spacecraft will undergo commissioning by Rocket Lab’s spacecraft operations team in the coming days, beginning with early checkouts including orientation stabilization and solar array deployment, followed by commissioning of flight computers, multiple antenna, guidance and navigation sensors and actuators, and the propulsion system leading up to the mission’s first maneuvers. Rocket Lab’s Explorer-class spacecraft platform is a high delta-V, interplanetary member of its advanced satellite family. From contract award to launch, ESCAPADE moved from design to spacecraft completion in just three and a half years – an aggressive timeline for a Mars mission. This was made possible by the Company’s vertically integrated supply chain, which brings the production of solar arrays, reaction wheels, propellant tanks, star trackers, radios, avionics, flight software, and more entirely in-house. “Mars missions have historically been measured in decades and come with price tags in the billions or hundreds of millions. With this mission we’re bringing Mars closer, proving real interplanetary science can be done faster and more cost-effectively to unlock the solar system,” said Sir Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab. “ESCAPADE is a major first, not just for Rocket Lab, but for commercial interplanetary science. It’s the result of bold goals from NASA and UC Berkeley, enabled by our end-to-end spacecraft capabilities. We’re proud to play a part in this mission and even prouder to know they’re continuing our legacy at the Red Planet.” Rob Lillis, ESCAPADE Principal Investigator and Associate Director for Planetary Science at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, says: "As PI, I'm very grateful to have a top-notch joint ops team at UC Berkeley and Rocket Lab taking care of the twin spacecraft out there in space. I'm both elated and relieved to see NASA’s ESCAPADE spacecraft healthy post-launch and looking forward to the next chapter of their journey to help us understand Mars' dynamic space weather environment." Now in orbit, a complex and extended journey begins for Blue and Gold, with trajectory design led by Advanced Space LLC. The alignment between Earth and Mars does not currently allow ESCAPADE to use a traditional direct-to-Mars transfer. Instead, ESCAPADE will launch into a “loiter” (or “Earth-proximity”) orbit that loops around Earth’s Lagrange point 2 (about a million miles from Earth, opposite the Sun) until the next planetary alignment window. Once the planets have reached the ideal alignment in fall 2026, the ESCAPADE spacecraft will use an Earth gravity assist to begin the journey to Mars. Throughout the mission, Rocket Lab and UC Berkeley spacecraft operators will command the spacecraft to conduct deep-space maneuvers, known as trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs). The TCMs will boost the spacecraft’s energy to reach Mars and provide navigation control to target their unique orbit insertion corridors. The spacecraft are scheduled to arrive at Mars in September 2027. The spacecraft will begin to transition to their first science formation in 2028. ESCAPADE will allow scientists to understand how the solar wind strips ions from Mars’ atmosphere, offering insight into the planet’s atmospheric escape history and space weather environment, and informing future human exploration strategies.

The findings, based on responses from 1,396 professionals, highlight widespread abuse of legal loopholes by global tech firms operating in the country. For most affected employees, the layoff process lacked both legal compliance and humane communication. 72 per cent were informed within two days of their last working day. The rate was especially high at Amazon, Target and Freshworks, exceeding 90 per cent. Only 18 per cent said they received any advance notice of one to three months as mandated by law. According to Blind, many MNCs operating in India’s tech and service sectors have long taken advantage of a gap in the country’s labor framework that excludes IT and managerial staff from the “workmen” category. This allows them to legally bypass mandatory notice periods and government approval under the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), leaving tens of millions of white-collar professionals outside the scope of labor protections. 37 per cent were informed via Zoom or Teams calls, 23 per cent received impersonal email notifications, and 13 per cent discovered they had been terminated only after their system access was suddenly cut off. Even when sudden layoffs technically breach the spirit of the law, companies frequently use “in lieu of notice” payments to avoid penalties — paying a short-term severance instead of giving advance warning. This loophole enables overnight, American-style layoffs that would otherwise be illegal under Indian labor standards. On Blind, several affected professionals shared how these practices are eroding trust and mental security within India’s tech scene. “It’s a cruel psychological game: keep people anxious, hoping some will quit voluntarily, saving the company money on severance,” wrote an employee from Amazon India.

Title: Exowatt has a rock-solid plan to provide cheap, abundant energy for AI data centers

UPDATED 21:32 EST / NOVEMBER 13 2025 by Mike Wheatley Exowatt Inc., a solar-thermal energy startup backed by OpenAI Group PBC Chief Executive Sam Altman and other high-profile investors, wants to solve the artificial intelligence energy crisis with millions of hot rocks. To do that, it has raised millions of dollars – $50 million in fact, led by MVP Ventures and 8090 Industries. Today’s round also saw participation from other investors that included Atomic, Bridge Bay Ventures, the Florida Opportunity Fund, DeepWork Capital, Dragon Global and Massive VC. The round is described as an extension of the company’s original $70 million Series A, which closed in April. Altman’s involvement stems from its original seed funding round in 2024, where he was one of several angel investors. Exowatt says its thermal battery technology, powered by solar energy, has the potential to provide enormous AI data centers with electricity at rates as low as one cent per kilowatt-hour, which would make it around 90% cheaper than the average U.S. grid rate. If it can do this, it’s sure to be of enormous interest to AI data center operators such as Microsoft Corp., Amazon Web Services Inc., Google LLC and Oracle Corp., which are all desperate for energy as they scramble to build out their infrastructure. With data centers springing up across the country, operators are desperate to secure a power source for them, but grid queues in some locations can stretch for years. As a result, data centers are being built faster than power suppliers can keep up. Exowatt is pitching a somewhat unconventional solution to this looming crisis, with millions of superheated rocks held in storage that can provide energy around the clock. The company’s solar-thermal energy works by using concentrated solar power to heat up special ceramic or rock-based materials to temperatures as high as 1,200°C when the sun is shining. These materials act as thermal batteries, releasing the stored heat to power steam turbines that generate electricity, even when the sun goes down. It transforms rocks into a power source, and once the system is set up and in place, it can provide electricity much more cheaply than through conventional means, which typically cost from eight to 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. The math is compelling, especially when considering the future energy requirements of data centers. Today, these facilities consume about 1% of the world’s electricity, but the demand for AI is forecast to push that up to around 3% to 4% by the end of the decade, Exowatt says. Exowatt’s challenge is that it needs to gear up its manufacturing operation to produce 1 million thermal battery units per year. It said this target is necessary for it to deliver on its penny-per-kWh promise through economies of scale. Doing so is easier said than done, though, considering that Exowatt has only built a handful of batteries so far. Still, it has gotten enough backing to at least attempt to reach that goal. Altman is one of a number of voices in the AI industry who has been quite vocal about the need to solve the looming power bottleneck, and many of his rivals are pursuing different ideas. For instance, Meta Platforms Inc. is exploring nuclear energy, particularly the use of small modular reactors that can be located close to its data centers. Google LLC has also invested in a number of nuclear energy startups, as has Amazon. Aside from exploiting more fossil fuels, renewable energy is really the main alternative to nuclear power, and it is certainly popular with environmentalists, but the problem is that solar- and wind-farms require affordable and reliable storage solutions to be able to meet AI’s power demands 24/7. Most existing energy storage systems use lithium-ion batteries, but they’re very expensive and there are concerns around the availability of the rare earth elements needed in their construction. Thermal storage provides some advantages. The rocks and ceramics are much cheaper, and they’re also more durable. Exowatt says its rock-based storage systems can maintain heat for about five days and they never degrade – unlike lithium-ion batteries, which gradually lose capacity over the endless charging cycles they have to endure. That said, there are questions about the real-world performance of Exowatt’s system, which has never been attempted at such a large scale, as well as grid integration. Previous solar-thermal energy projects have suffered with efficiency problems and unforeseen maintenance costs, and Exowatt will have to show that its batteries can deliver on its cost promises and operate in diverse climates. That may be why the company hasn’t yet announced a specific timeline for deploying its technology, nor any major customers. Even so, Exowatt has the capital, the demand and timing on its side, and if it can scale up its technology to achieve its ambitious price targets, it might just become the rock on which the future AI industry is built.

Title: Amazon slashes nearly 700 jobs in New York alone amid plans of 14,000 job cuts – here's what we know

E-commerce giant Amazon cut 660 jobs in Manhattan in October, according to a report by the New York Post citing New York State government records. Amazon confirmed that nine office locations were affected, impacting only corporate employees. The most affected sites were two locations. The 450 W 33rd St offices near Hudson Yards experienced 233 layoffs, and the 424 Fifth Ave. offices at the former Lord & Taylor flagship, acquired by Amazon in 2020 for $1 billion, had 182 layoffs, the report said, citing Monday filings from the state Department of Labour. “I believe the vast majority of these cuts are tech layoffs for Amazon, and NYC was not spared,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told The Post. “The size of the Amazon cuts remains a head scratcher given the battle for talent and the AI revolution in motion.” The latest development after Amazon confirmed plans to cut nearly 14,000 corporate jobs, just months after Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy highlighted growing use of AI. During Amazon's earnings call on Thursday, Andy Jassy clarified that the layoffs were not due to cost-cutting measures or the adoption of AI. Instead, he said that the employees affected did not align with Amazon's culture. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Andy Jassy said, adding that “it really — it's culture.” The layoffs are impacting various departments, including logistics, payments, video games, and cloud computing, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said in a blog post last month. Galetti hinted at further job cuts, mentioning Amazon's plan to hire in key areas in 2026. The company reportedly plans to cut approximately 30,000 corporate jobs in the latest round of layoffs, which will constitute about 9% of its global office-based workforce, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the development. Indicating the reason for job cuts, she said, “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Who’s Afraid of the AI Boogeyman?

Time Published: 2025-11-13T23:00:00Z

It is becoming ever more obvious that many people fear rapidly developing Artificial Intelligence (AI), for various reasons, such as its supposed superiority, compared to humans, as far as processing and manipulating information is concerned, as well as its adaptability and efficiency in the workplace, which many fear would lead to the replacement of most human beings in the employment market. Amazon recently announced that it was replacing 14,000 individuals with AI robots, for example. Alex Valdes writes: The layoffs are reportedly the largest in Amazon history, and come just months after CEO Andy Jassy outlined his vision for how the company would rapidly ramp up its development of generative AI and AI agents. The cuts are the latest in a wave of layoffs this year as tech giants including Microsoft, Accenture, Salesforce and India’s TCS have reduced their workforces by thousands in what has become a frenzied push to invest in AI. Lest this is too disturbing to tolerate, contrast this with the reassuring statement, from an AI developer, to boot, that AI agents could not replace human beings. Brian Shilhavy points out that: Andrej Karpathy, one of the founding members of OpenAI, on Friday threw cold water on the idea that artificial general intelligence is around the corner. He also cast doubt on various assumptions about AI made by the industry’s biggest boosters, such as Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and OpenAI’s Sam Altman. The highly regarded Karpathy called reinforcement learning—arguably the most important area of research right now—’terrible,’ said AI-powered coding agents aren’t as exciting as many people think, and said AI cannot reason about anything it hasn’t already been trained on. His comments, from a podcast interview with Dwarkesh Patel, struck a chord with some of the AI researchers we talk to, including those who have also worked at OpenAI and Anthropic. They also echoed comments we heard from researchers at the International Conference on Machine Learning earlier this year. A lot of Karpathy’s criticisms of his own field seem to boil down to a single point: As much as we like to anthropomorphize large language models, they’re not comparable to humans or even animals in the way they learn. For instance, zebras are up and walking around just a few minutes after they’re born, suggesting that they’re born with some level of innate intelligence, while LLMs have to go through immense trial and error to learn any new skill, Karpathy points out. This is already comforting, but lest the fear of AI persist, it can be dispelled further by elaborating on the differences between AI and human beings, which, if understood adequately, would drive home the realisation that such anxieties are mostly redundant (although others are not, as I shall argue below). The most obvious difference in question is the fact that AI (for example, ChatGPT) is dependent on being equipped with a vast database on which it draws to come up with answers to questions, which it formulates predictively through pattern recognition. Then, as pointed out above, even the most sophisticated AI has to be ‘trained’ to yield the information one seeks. Moreover, unlike humans, it lacks ‘direct’ access to experiential reality in perceptual, spatiotemporal terms – something which I have experienced frequently when confronted by people who draw on ChatGPT to question certain arguments. For example, when I gave a talk recently on how Freud and Hannah Arendt’s work – on civilisation and totalitarianism, respectively – enables one to grasp the character of the globalist onslaught against extant society, with a view to establishing a central, AI-controlled world government, someone in the audience produced a printout of ChatGPT’s response to the question, whether these two thinkers could indeed deliver the goods, as it were. Predictably, it summarised the relevant work of these two thinkers quite adequately, but was stumped by the requirement to show how it applies to the growing threat of totalitarian control in real time. My interlocutor used this as grounds to question my own assertions in this regard, on the assumption that the AI bot’s response was an indication that no such threat exists. Needless to stress, it was not difficult to repudiate this claim by reminding him of ChatGPT’s dependence on being supplied with the relevant data, while we humans have access to the latter on experiential grounds, which I proceeded to outline to him. The fear of AI also finds expression in science fiction, together with intimations of possible modes of resistance to AI-machines which may – probably would – attempt to exterminate their human creators, as has been imagined in science fiction cinema, including Moore’s Battlestar Galactica and Cameron’s Terminator films. It is not difficult to demonstrate that such products of popular culture frame the current symptoms of fear pertaining to AI in imaginary terms, which may be seen as a crystallisation of repressed, unconscious anxiety, related to what Freud called ‘the uncanny’ (unheimlich, in German; more on this below). Both Moore and Cameron elaborate on the likelihood that the very creatures engendered by human beings’ technological ingenuity will eventually turn on their creators to annihilate them. In Alex Garland’s Ex Machina (2014), again, one witnesses an AI ‘fembot’ called Ava, subtly manipulating her human counterparts to the point of her escape from confinement and their own destruction. Undeniably, these, and many other similar instances, are incontrovertible evidence of a hidden fear on the part of humanity that AI constitutes a possible threat to its own existence. Precisely because these fears are lodged in the human unconscious, however, they are not the main reason to take any threat posed by AI seriously, although they do comprise a valuable caveat. The chief reason for regarding AI as a legitimate source of intimidation does not arise from AI as such, as many readers probably already know. Rather, it concerns the manner in which the globalists intend to use AI to control what they perceive as the ‘useless eaters’ – the rest of us, in other words. And those of us who do not go along with their grandiose plans of total world control would fall victim to being ‘reprogrammed’ into compliant ‘sheeple’ by AI: Yuval Noah Harari has emerged from the shadows to brag about the new technology developed by WEF scientists which he warns has the power to destroy every human in the world by transforming them into transhuman entities. Harari has made clear who will survive the great depopulation event the elite have been warning us about for years. According to Harari, the global elite will survive thanks to a ‘technological Noah’s ark’ while the rest of us will be left to perish. In this vastly depopulated world, the elite will be free to change themselves into transhuman entities and become the gods they already believe themselves to be. But first the elite need to eliminate the non-compliant masses, those who are opposed to the anti-life and godless WEF agenda, and as Harari boasts, the elite now command the AI technology to ‘ethically’ destroy non-compliant humans by hijacking their brains. Disturbingly, Harari’s claims are grounded in reality and the WEF is rolling out the mind-control technology as we speak. Davos claims the tech can transform criminals, including those accused of thought crimes, into perfectly compliant globalist citizens who will never dissent again. There you have it – AI will be the tool, if the globalists have their way, of forcing us into submission. Needless to point out, this could only happen if sufficient numbers of people fail to resist their plans, and judging by the number of people who are showing their opposition to the would-be rulers of the world, this will not occur. Another way of gaining an understanding of the fear of AI is to liken it to what is commonly known as ‘the boogeyman.’ As some people may know, the ‘boogeyman’ (or ‘bogeyman’) – a creature of mythical proportions, which assumes different shapes and sizes in many cultures, often to scare children as a way of eliciting good behaviour – is variously presented as a monstrous, grotesque, or shapeless creature. As a little research indicates, the word derives from the Middle English term, ‘bogge,’ or ‘bugge,’ which means ‘scarecrow,’ or ‘frightening spectre.’ Being a quintessentially human phenomenon, it is not surprising that it has equivalent names in many folklore traditions and languages across the world. Just like languages, depictions of this frightening figure diverge strikingly, often attaining its ominous and scary character from the element of formlessness, such as the figure of ‘El Coco’ in Spanish-speaking countries, the ‘Sack Man’ in Latin America, and the ‘Babau’ in Italy, sometimes imagined as a tall, black-coated man. The boogeyman figure may be regarded as a kind of Jungian archetype, encountered in the collective unconscious, which probably originated centuries ago from parents’ need to frighten children into obedience by means of a version of the unknown. In South Africa, where I live, it sometimes assumes the shape of what indigenous people call the ‘tikoloshe’ – a malevolent, and sometimes mischievous, dwarfish figure with an enormous sexual appetite. Being an archetype, it has also made its way into a popular genre such as horror film, manifesting itself in grotesque characters such as Freddy Krueger, the eponymous ‘Nightmare on Elm Street.’ So, in what sense does AI resemble the ‘boogeyman?’ The latter is related to what Sigmund Freud memorably called ‘the uncanny,’ of which he writes (in The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, translated by James Strachey, 1974: 3676): ‘…the uncanny is that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar.’ This already hints at what he uncovers later in this essay, after uncovering the surprising fact that the German word for ‘homely,’ to wit, ‘heimlich,’ turns out to be ambivalent in its usage, so that it sometimes means the opposite of ‘homely,’ namely ‘unheimlich’ (‘unhomely,’ better translated as ‘uncanny’). That the concept of ‘the uncanny’ is suitable to grasp what I have in mind when I allude to ‘the fear of AI,’ becomes evident where Freud writes (referring to another author whose work on the ‘uncanny’ he regarded as important; Freud 1974: 3680): When we proceed to review the things, persons, impressions, events and situations which are able to arouse in us a feeling of the uncanny in a particularly forcible and definite form, the first requirement is obviously to select a suitable example to start on. Jentsch has taken as a very good instance ‘doubts whether an apparently animate being is really alive; or conversely, whether a lifeless object might not be in fact animate;’ and he refers in this connection to the impression made by wax-work figures, ingeniously constructed dolls and automata. To these he adds the uncanny effect of epileptic fits, and of manifestations of insanity, because these excite in the spectator the impression of automatic, mechanical processes at work behind the ordinary appearance of mental activity. Here, already one encounters a trait of the uncanny that conspicuously applies to AI – the impression created by AI that it is somehow ‘alive.’ This was the case even of the first, ‘primitive’ computers, such as the one in the episode on the First Commandment, of Krzysztof Kieslowski’s 1989 television series regarding the Ten Commandments, called The Decalogue, where the words, ‘I am here,’ appear on the computer screen when the father and his son use it. The ominous implication in this episode is that if humanity were to replace God with AI, it would be disastrous for us, as shown in the fact that the father is sufficiently ‘rationalist’ to trust the computer’s calculations of the thickness of the ice on which his son skates, which turns out to be wrong, leading to the child’s death. Freud continues his investigation of the nature of ‘the uncanny’ by paying sustained attention to the work of E.T.A. Hoffman, whose stories are famous for producing a strong sense of the uncanny, particularly the tale of ‘The Sand-Man’ – ‘who tears out children’s eyes’ – which features, among several other uncanny figures (and very significantly), a beautiful, lifelike doll called Olympia. He then explains it by relating it in psychoanalytical terms to the castration complex – attached to the father figure – via the fear of losing one’s eyes (Freud 1974: 3683-3685). Freud continues his interpretation of the uncanny in a revealing manner by invoking a number of other psychoanalytically relevant aspects of experience, of which the following one appears to apply to AI (1974: 3694): …an uncanny effect is often and easily produced when the distinction between imagination and reality is effaced, as when something that we have hitherto regarded as imaginary appears before us in reality, or when a symbol takes over the full functions of the thing it symbolizes, and so on. It is this factor which contributes not a little to the uncanny effect attaching to magical practices. It is not difficult to recall instances in one’s childhood, Freud avers, when one has imagined inanimate objects, like toys (or animate ones, for that matter, such as a pet dog) to be capable of talking to you, but when it actually appears to happen (which would be a hallucination, as opposed to a deliberate imagining), it unavoidably produces an uncanny effect. One might expect the same thing to be the case with AI, whether in the shape of a computer or a robot, and ordinarily – perhaps at an earlier stage of AI development – this would probably have been the case. But today seems to be different: people, especially the young, have become so accustomed to interacting with computer software programmes, and recently with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, that what might have been an experience of the uncanny before is, for all intents and purposes, no longer the case. In this respect, the ‘uncanny’ appears to have been domesticated. As long ago as 2011, in Alone Together, Sherry Turkle reported that she was concerned about young people displaying an increasing tendency to prefer interacting with machines, rather than other human beings. Hence, it should not be in the least surprising that AI chatbots have assumed the guise of something ‘normal’ in the sphere of communication (leaving aside for the moment the question of the status of this vaunted ‘communication’). Furthermore – and here the fear of what AI could bring about on the part of all-too-trusting individuals raises its ugly head – from recent reports (such as this one) it is apparent that, particularly the young, are extremely susceptible to chatbots’ ‘advice’ and suggestions concerning their own actions, as Michael Snyder points out: Our kids are being targeted by AI chatbots on a massive scale, and most parents have no idea that this is happening. When you are young and impressionable, having someone tell you exactly what you want to hear can be highly appealing. AI chatbots have become extremely sophisticated, and millions of America’s teens are developing very deep relationships with them. Is this just harmless fun, or is it extremely dangerous? A brand new study that was just released by the Center for Democracy & Technology contains some statistics that absolutely shocked me… A new study published Oct. 8 by the Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) found that 1 in 5 high school students have had a relationship with an AI chatbot, or know someone who has. In a 2025 report from Common Sense Media, 72% of teens had used an AI companion, and a third of teen users said they had chosen to discuss important or serious matters with AI companions instead of real people. We aren’t just talking about a few isolated cases anymore. At this stage, literally millions upon millions of America’s teens are having very significant relationships with AI chatbots. Unfortunately, there are many examples where these relationships are leading to tragic consequences. After 14-year-old Sewell Setzer developed a ‘romantic relationship’ with a chatbot on Character.AI, he decided to take his own life… As the preceding discussion shows, there are some areas of human activity where one need not fear AI, and then there are others where such fears are legitimate, sometimes because of the manner in which unscrupulous people harness AI against other people. But whatever the case may be, the best way to approach the tricky terrain regarding the capabilities of AI vis-á-vis humans is to remind oneself of the fact that – as argued at the outset in this article – AI depends on vast amounts of data to draw on, and on being ‘trained’ by programmers to do this. Humans do not.

TRENDING: Biotech Firm Unveils New Promise For Hard-To-Treat Lung Cancer AI stocks have pulled back recently on bubble concerns, which has raised the stakes for Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming earnings report. "The biggest/most important company in the world reports next week," Daniel O'Regan, managing director of equity trading for Mizuho Securities, said in a client note Thursday. "The entire AI trade depends on it (not 100%, but it's big)." The artificial intelligence chip designer will release its fiscal third-quarter results after the market close on Wednesday. Analysts polled by FactSet expect Nvidia to earn an adjusted $1.25 a share on sales of $54.8 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 26. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 54% in earnings and 56% in sales. Supply and demand issues related to AI chips will be a key focus of Nvidia's Q3 report, analysts say. According to media reports, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang has been pushing contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) to add production capacity to make its chips. Meanwhile, Nvidia investors want to see signs that AI chip orders remain robust. Nvidia stock has fallen since notching a record high of 212.19 on Oct. 29. On the stock market today, Nvidia stock dropped 3.6% to close at 186.86. Other AI chip stocks retreating on Thursday included AMD (AMD), Astera Labs (ALAB), Broadcom (AVGO) and Credo Technology (CRDO). Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland reiterated his positive rating on Nvidia stock and raised his price target to 230 from 210. "We expect better results and guidance as GB300 is expected to continue ramping" in the second half of the year, Rolland said in a client note Thursday. Data center "AI demand continues to be supported by ever-increasing hyperscale capex plans." Rolland wondered if Huang will address "intensifying chatter" around global data-center builds hitting a "power wall" beginning in 2028. The AI data center buildout needs increasing electricity, necessitating new power plants. On Wednesday, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer maintained his outperform rating on Nvidia stock and upped his price target to 265 from 225. Nvidia "remains best positioned to win in AI," Schafer said. He noted chip supply constraints and data-center power limitations as bottlenecks for the company.

Title: The Shutdown Is Over. Winter Is Usually Good For Stocks. Here's Why Investors Are Selling.

The stock market cleared a major hurdle this week. It's the outset of what is historically a good time for equities. You wouldn't know it if you looked at your portfolio today. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed legislation to reopen the federal government, ending the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The reopening removes the economic drag from more than 1 million federal workers going without pay and clears a path for federal agencies to once again release vital economic data. Yet stocks were falling Thursday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which finished the day down more than 2%—perhaps a “buy the rumor, sell the news” event, since stocks rallied on Monday as an end to the shutdown looked imminent. AI optimism and expectations for rate cuts have been two of the primary drivers of stock returns this year. If either AI or the Federal Reserve fail to meet Wall Street's expectations, stocks may be vulnerable to correction. Historically, the end of a shutdown has supported stocks, according to Adam Turnquist, Chief Technical Strategist at LPL Financial. Since 1976, he wrote Wednesday, covering 20 shutdowns, the S&P 500 has risen more in the one- and three-month periods after a budget resolution than in all other comparable periods. This shutdown is also ending at a time of year that’s historically good for the stock market. Since 2000, November has, on average, been the best month of the year for the S&P 500. December, another positive month, is more often than not capped off with a Santa Claus rally. But the mood on Wall Street heading into the end of the year appears more dour than rosy, with investors debating the existence of an AI bubble and uncertain what incoming economic data will say about the health of the economy. The debate about an AI bubble has taken a toll on tech stocks in recent weeks. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) slid 7% last week, and were down more than 3.5% on Thursday. Palantir (PLTR) stock tumbled 8% the day after it posted earnings that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. On Thursday, the majority of the S&P 500’s worst-performing stocks were high-flying AI beneficiaries like software firm Applovin (APP) and chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO). AI bubble concerns are being fueled by soaring valuations in both public and private markets. OpenAI, which doesn't expect to turn a profit until 2029, is valued at $500 billion. Palantir, even with its recent pullback, trades at about 240 times forward earnings. The chasm between AI spending and AI revenue has also raised eyebrows. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) intend to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build data centers and fill them with AI-enabling equipment. They have had some success showing investors that AI is contributing to their top and bottom lines, but some investors are turning skeptical. Wall Street has also taken note of a shift in how AI investments are funded. Up to this point, tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon have mostly relied on cash flows to build data centers and buy chips. Proponents of the AI bubble narrative have frequently pointed to the size and stability of these cash flows to argue for the AI boom’s sustainability. Investors will also be watching economic data heading into the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting of the year next month. Inflation and labor market reports were delayed by the shutdown, denying Wall Street and the Fed vital economic temperature checks. And, despite the end of the shutdown, investors aren’t sure when they’ll get that data, if at all. The White House on Wednesday suggested inflation and labor market data for October may never be released, which would leave policymakers to lean on other public and private datasets as they deliberate whether to cut interest rates for a third time this year in mid-December. Officials are divided on how to proceed. Some have urged caution, citing concerns that inflation, which has reaccelerated this year, could stick above their 2% target. The data blackout has given inflation-wary officials even more reason to argue for slower cuts. Meanwhile, recent private sector data suggests that labor market conditions have deteriorated more than expected this year, giving dovish officials fodder to argue for more aggressive cuts. Wall Street increasingly believes the hawks, who favor higher rates, have the upper hand. Federal funds futures trading data on Thursday put the odds of a December rate cut at 47%, down from 96% a month ago and 63% yesterday.

Palantir (PLTR) stock tumbled 8% the day after it posted earnings that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. On Thursday, the majority of the S&P 500’s worst-performing stocks were high-flying AI beneficiaries like software firm Applovin (APP) and chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO). AI bubble concerns are being fueled by soaring valuations in both public and private markets. OpenAI, which doesn't expect to turn a profit until 2029, is valued at $500 billion. Palantir, even with its recent pullback, trades at about 240 times forward earnings. The chasm between AI spending and AI revenue has also raised eyebrows. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) intend to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build data centers and fill them with AI-enabling equipment. They have had some success showing investors that AI is contributing to their top and bottom lines, but some investors are turning skeptical. Wall Street has also taken note of a shift in how AI investments are funded. Up to this point, tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon have mostly relied on cash flows to build data centers and buy chips. Proponents of the AI bubble narrative have frequently pointed to the size and stability of these cash flows to argue for the AI boom’s sustainability. Investors will also be watching economic data heading into the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting of the year next month. Inflation and labor market reports were delayed by the shutdown, denying Wall Street and the Fed vital economic temperature checks. And, despite the end of the shutdown, investors aren’t sure when they’ll get that data, if at all. The White House on Wednesday suggested inflation and labor market data for October may never be released, which would leave policymakers to lean on other public and private datasets as they deliberate whether to cut interest rates for a third time this year in mid-December. Officials are divided on how to proceed. Some have urged caution, citing concerns that inflation, which has reaccelerated this year, could stick above their 2% target. The data blackout has given inflation-wary officials even more reason to argue for slower cuts. Meanwhile, recent private sector data suggests that labor market conditions have deteriorated more than expected this year, giving dovish officials fodder to argue for more aggressive cuts. Wall Street increasingly believes the hawks, who favor higher rates, have the upper hand. Federal funds futures trading data on Thursday put the odds of a December rate cut at 47%, down from 96% a month ago and 63% yesterday.

Δ According to the Thursday (Nov. 13) report, this would be the largest workforce reduction in the telecommunications giant’s history. In addition, 200 Verizon retail stores will be transitioned into franchised operations, sources said. This restructuring would remove the employees working at those locations from Verizon’s payroll. According to securities findings, as of February, Verizon had approximately 100,000 employees. As PYMNTS reported, the company appointed Dan Schulman as its CEO last month. Schulman, who previously held CEO roles at PayPal and Virgin Mobile USA, took over at Verizon as competition in the wireless and home internet markets continues to intensify. The largest U.S. telecommunications provider by subscriber base, Verizon is trying to offset the loss of postpaid phone subscribers for three consecutive quarters and a net loss of 7,000 postpaid phone connections in the latest quarter, WSJ said. Despite customer retention efforts, such as offering price-lock guarantees, competitors like AT&T and T-Mobile have continued to gain ground, the report said. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Pledging to cut costs and exit unprofitable legacy businesses aggressively, Schulman reportedly said in a call discussing the company’s third-quarter results, “We have a tremendous amount of opportunity to be more efficient, to be scrappier. Cost reductions will be a way of life for us here.” Verizon is not the only major company that’s downsizing to adapt to economic and technological shifts. As PYMNTS recently reported, Amazon has started cutting 30,000 jobs, UPS is rolling out buyouts and layoffs affecting 34,000 drivers and warehouse workers, and Target is eliminating 1,800 corporate jobs. The WSJ report quoted analysts from Morgan Stanley as saying that improvements for Verizon’s operational and financial performance are “possible, if not probable,” if the company maintains a rational market approach. It’s going to take some time, though.

Title: Crystal Dynamics Says ‘Painful’ Layoffs Required To ‘Optimize’ Development For Next Tomb Raider

Amazon GamesCrystal DynamicsLayoffsTomb Raider Crystal Dynamics is undergoing another round of cuts. It revealed on Thursday that nearly 30 more developers would be laid off as the company restructures for the future. Specifically, it claimed the cuts were necessary to “optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game.” The Amazon Games-backed project was announced three years ago and still no official details have been shared, though Kotaku understands its development has been challenging as Crystal Dynamics tried to push the franchise in the direction of an open-world experience. The studio announced the layoffs on LinkedIn: Today we’ve made the difficult but necessary decision to reorganize Crystal Dynamics’ studios and teams. As a result, we’ve parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation. Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition. To our players – as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we’ve made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future. We appreciate the continued support of our players, our colleagues, and our partners during this transition and look forward to sharing the team’s amazing new work with the world in the future. It’s the third round of layoffs this year and comes only months after cuts that were made due to the Microsoft’s cancellation of Perfect Dark, which Crystal Dynamics was doing the bulk of development on. The Xbox stealth action game was reportedly almost revived under a new publisher, but the deal felt apart over IP rights. The studio has been part of Embracer Group since it was sold by Square Enix as part of a $300 million package back in 2022. Its publishing partner for Tomb Raider, Amazon Games, recently underwent its own mass layoffs and announced it was taking a step back from certain internally developed AAA games. Crystal Dynamics’ latest budgetary pressures could possible be the result of Amazon pulling back on the deal. Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips. Sign up for our free newsletter.

Title: Corporate Executives Say Trump’s Economy Has Left U.S. Consumers “Under Pressure” and “Stressed”

A project of Common Dreams press@groundworkcollaborative.org Corporate executives are quietly acknowledging what millions of Americans already feel: Trump’s economy is squeezing lower- and middle-income families while corporations enjoy record profits and the wealthy continue to prosper. Consumer outlook indicators point in the same direction. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment declined across nearly every demographic group this November — by age, income, and political leaning — except for those with the largest stock portfolios, whose confidence jumped 11%. Similarly, consumer confidence data from the Conference Board showed that the confidence dropped among Americans earning under $75,000 and increased the most for those making more than $200,000 — a clear sign that everyday Americans are growing more worried about their finances, having to spend less just to stay afloat as the K-shaped economy deepens. Key Excerpts Food and Beverage Industry Scott Boatwright, Chipotle Chief Executive Officer and Director said during a Q3 2025 earnings call: “Earlier this year, as consumer sentiment declined sharply, we saw a broad-based pullback in frequency across all income cohorts. Since then, the gap has widened, with low to middle-income guests further reducing frequency.” He continued to say, “The economists we have spoken to over the last several quarters, say, Q4, Q1 [are] likely to be the toughest for the consumer. Specifically the cohort under $100,000. A particularly challenged cohort is the 25- to 35-year-old age group [...] This group is facing several headwinds, including unemployment, increased student loan repayment and slower real wage growth.” Coca-Cola's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun stated during a Q3 2025 earnings call that “When we look from a consumer point of view, we continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups. The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there." Constellation Brands (Makers of Modello and Corona Beer) Chief Executive Officer William Newlands told attendees at the Barclays 18th Annual Global Consumer Staples Conference 2025 “The Hispanic consumer is very concerned at the moment. 80% are concerned about socioeconomic factors, 75% are concerned about their personal finances. It means that their shopping behavior has changed.” General Mills’ Group President of North America Retail & North America Pet Dana McNabb said during an Investor Day meeting that “the consumer is still adjusting to this once-in-a-lifetime inflationary period and trying to find their footing...they're stressed." General Mills’ CEO Jeffery Harmening followed up by noting that "the combination of the length of the inflation that we have seen and inflation is still running at or ahead of wage growth. And so consumers, if you're making $200,000 a year or less, you are really feeling that pinch even still today." Kraft-Heinz CEO and Director Carlos Abrams-Rivera laid it out on the Q3 2025 earning call saying that “fact that we have now one of the worst consumer sentiments we have seen in decades...it is a unique moment right now in which this is getting -- the consumer negativity and the sentiment is extending longer than we had originally expected." Jack Sinclair, CEO and director for grocery store chain Sprout's Farmers Market told shareholders on the Q3 2025 earnings Call that "from a consumer pressure perspective, I mean, I think that's building … a little bit more in the kind of lower and middle income is what you read about and what you hear. [...] middle-income trade areas, younger demographics … it's just a little more pronounced in those, but I think the pressure is there for everybody and everyone is trying to figure out how they manage through that in a dynamic environment.” Dirk Van de Put, the Chair and CEO of Mondelez (Makers of Oreo cookies, Halls cough drops, and Wheat Thins) said on a Q3 2025 earnings call that while their consumers are “very concerned in general about the economy, frustrated with the pricing they're seeing,” Mondelez’s seasonal products allow the company to charge higher prices because "the consumer is not that clear on what the right price point is and also is inclined to pay a little bit more." Travel Industry American Airlines' Chief Strategy Officer, Steve Johnson, said on a Q3 earnings call that “Nearly 50% of our ticket revenue comes from premium,” and as a result the airline is planning to add additional premium seats to its fleet. On an Q3 earnings call, Scott Kirby, United Airlines’ CEO described how economic stress causes demand to "bleed off on the lower end” making more seats available for brand loyal customers. The Groundwork Collaborative is dedicated to advancing a coherent and persuasive progressive economic worldview and narrative capable of delivering meaningful opportunity and prosperity for everyone. Our work is driven by a core guiding principle: We are the economy. Groundwork Collaborative envisions an economic system that produces strong, broadly shared prosperity and power for all people, not just a wealthy few. "We commend every Democrat and Republican who signed the discharge petition to bring the Protect America's Workforce Act to a vote, but the fight isn't over," said AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler. Two Republicans in the US House of Representatives on Monday added their names to a discharge petition that will now force a vote on legislation to restore the collective bargaining rights of hundreds of thousands of federal workers targeted by GOP President Donald Trump. US Reps. Jared Golden (D-Maine) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) responded to Trump's legally contentious executive order by introducing the Protect America's Workforce Act in April. They began collecting petition signatures in June. At least 218 members had to sign it to override House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and force a vote on the bill. CodePink said the plan "will leave Palestine in the hands of a puppet administration, assigning the United States, which shares complicity in the genocide, as the new manager of the open-air prison." Palestine defenders decried Monday's approval by the United Nations Security Council of a US plan authorizing a so-called international stabilization force for Gaza—a plan decried by one peace group as a denial of Palestinian self-determination. Thirteen UNSC members voted for the resolution, while no nation voted against the proposal. China abstained, as did Russia, which submitted a rival draft resolution. "Labour won't redistribute wealth from billionaires," said former party Leader Jeremy Corbyn. "But they will seize belongings from those fleeing war and persecution." A new asylum policy announced Monday by the UK Labour Party will allow authorities to confiscate the jewelry and other belongings of asylum-seekers in order to pay for their claims to be processed. The policy, which some critics said was "reminiscent of the Nazi era," was just one part of the Labour Party's total overhaul of the nation's asylum system, which it says must be made much more restrictive in order to fend off rising support for the far-right.

Title: As Trump Drives Up Costs, Record Share of Subprime Auto Loans Overdue

An advertisement for easy financing is posted on the front window of a used car lot on September 6, 2023 in San Pablo, California. "The vulnerable part of the economy is having an even tougher time making ends meet," said one finance professor. Last month's jobs report may never be released after being delayed during the federal government shutdown, but other figures demonstrate the havoc President Donald Trump is wreaking on the US economy, including new data for subprime borrowers behind on car payments. The share of US borrowers with low credit scores or limited credit histories who are at least 60 days past due on their auto loans rose to 6.65% in October, the highest percentage since Fitch Ratings began tracking it in the early 1990s. "The vulnerable part of the economy is having an even tougher time making ends meet," Massachusetts Institute of Technology finance professor Christopher Palmer told Marketplace on Wednesday in response to the new data. As Bloomberg reported Wednesday: Fitch's findings on missed car payments notably follow two key disruptions in the auto lending space. "PrimaLend, which serves the 'buy-here-pay-here' auto financing market—where dealers sell and directly finance vehicles for customers with poor or limited credit—filed for bankruptcy protection last month," Reuters reported. "Tricolor, which sold cars and provided auto loans mostly to low-income Hispanic communities in the Southwestern United States, also filed for bankruptcy in September." In mid-October, the credit score model development company VantageScore released an analysis showing that auto loans "have now evolved from being one of the least risky consumer credit products to one of the loan types most prone to delinquencies," as consumers struggle with rising interest rates, financing costs, and prices of cars, insurance, and repairs. "Auto loans have not followed the trends of other credit products as delinquencies have been persistently trending up across all credit tiers and income groups over the past 15 years," said VantageScore's chief economist and strategy officer, Rikard Bandebo, in a statement. "Even after the industry tightened lending criteria three years ago, delinquencies have continued to rise." A few days before the VantageScore analysis, Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book announced that in September, the average transaction price (ATP) of a new vehicle in the US had soared above $50,000 for the first time. "It is important to remember that the new vehicle market is inflationary. Prices go up over time, and today's market is certainly reminding us of that," said Cox Automotive executive analyst Erin Keating last month. "The $20,000 vehicle is now mostly extinct, and many price-conscious buyers are sidelined or cruising in the used vehicle market. Today's auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates, and are propping up the higher end of the market." "Tariffs have introduced new cost pressure to the business, but the pricing story in September was mostly driven by the healthy mix of EVs and higher-end vehicles pushing the new vehicle ATP into uncharted territory," she added. "We've been expecting to break through the $50,000 barrier. It was only a matter of time, especially when you consider the bestselling vehicle in America is a pickup truck from Ford that routinely costs north of $65,000. That's today's market, and it is ripe for disruption." Other recent findings that have shown the economic deterioration under Trump include a Thursday report from Democrats on the congressional Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which found that the average US family is spending around $700 more each month on basic items since Trump returned to office in January. "As families across the country spend more to pay their bills and put food on the table, Democrats and Republicans should be working together to lower costs," said Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH), the JEC’s ranking member. "Instead, President Trump is pushing ahead with reckless tariffs that continue to fuel inflation and drive prices up even higher." A closely watched University of Michigan survey revealed last week that since October, consumer sentiment has fallen over 6% to 50.3, the second-lowest level since 1978, and the "current economic conditions" index has dropped nearly 11% to an all-time low of 52.3. Earlier in November, the Washington Post reported on layoff data from corporate outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which documented 153,000 job cuts in October, bringing the total for this year to 1.1 million. "We haven't seen mega-layoffs of the size that are being discussed now—48,000 from UPS, potentially 30,000 from Amazon—since 2020 and before that, since the recession of 2009," said the firm's CEO, John Challenger.

Title: Verizon layoffs: American telecommunications company to cut 15,000 jobs amid restructuring — Who will get affected?

Verizon layoffs: Verizon, the leading American telecommunications company, is set to reduce thousands of roles as part of a restructuring under its new CEO Dan Schulman, reported Reuters. The company is planning to cut about 15,000 jobs, 15% of its workforce, said the report, citing person familiar with the matter. However, a Verizon spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. The new CEO's first commitment was to stop the bleeding from subscriber churn, which would require subsidizing expensive handsets for a huge number of Verizon's subscribers to keep them from leaving, Craig Moffett, senior analyst at Moffett Nathanson, told Reuters. The layoffs are set to take place as soon as next week. The job cuts are aimed at Verizon's non-union management ranks and are expected to affect more than 20% of that workforce, a source told Reuters. He added that Verizon also plans to transition around 180 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations. As subscriber growth slows and cautious consumers are unwilling to buy premium wireless plans, Verizon is battling rising competition. The coompany is also facing mounting pressure from rivals AT&T and T-Mobile US. At the end of 2024, Verizon had about 1,00,000 US employees. Last year it announced a reduction of 4,800 employees through a voluntary program and took a nearly $2 billion charge. — Verizon spent $52 billion to acquire key wireless C-Band spectrum in a 2021 auction. — The telecommunication company struck a $20 billion deal to acquire Frontier Communications last year. — Verizon also spent $6 billion to acquire prepaid mobile phone provider TracFone Wireless. Amazon, TCS, Microsoft, IBM and several other companies have announced layoffs. Earlier this month, tech giant IBM said that it would cut thousands of roles amid focus on software growth. “In the fourth quarter we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” said the company's spokesperson. According to Layoffs.fyi - a platform that tracks global tech industry layoffs — over 110,502 tech workers have been laid off across 226 tech companies in 2025 alone. Amazon has announced that it will reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 people. The total workforce of Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest IT services firm, reduced to 593,314 after the count dropped by 19,755, as of the second quarter of the financial year 2025-26.

Agentic calling, 'Buy for me,' and shop with Gemini. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's the holiday season, and Google is rolling out some epic tools to help you find the perfect holiday gift, but here's the catch — with Gemini, so that you don't have to jump several hoops to find that one thing you spotted on social media or that a friend recently wore. Google is making AI Mode do the heavy lifting for you, so users can go beyond simple two-line queries and really get into the details when describing the product they need. Users can now have conversations with AI Mode in Search, much like they would with a store employee in person, describing exactly what they're looking for instead of typing several lines. When you ask AI Mode a shopping question, you’ll not only get results to your search query, but it will also give you the images along with a breakdown of other purchasing details like price, reviews, and inventory info, helping users "quickly and confidently decide what to buy." For instance, if you need some visual inspiration, you can simply say “cozy sweaters for happy hour in warm autumn colors,” and you’ll see shoppable images. By simply asking for "moisturizers suited to your skin type," you will be presented with multiple products, including insights from reviews (such as how a moisturizer feels on the skin), allowing for a quick understanding of the differences. Additionally, the Gemini app will also feature these new shopping tools so you can shop even when you're chatting with the AI bot. The feature pops up when users ask a shopping-related query. Google says it will give you shopping inspiration for events like Black Friday or holiday lists, providing shoppable product listings, comparison tables, and more. Google's Agentic AI can now find products in stock nearby, saving you the hassle of calling multiple stores and wasting your time being on hold. When you search for products "near me" on Google Search, select "Let Google Call." AI will then call local stores on your behalf to check availability, price, and promos. You'll receive an email or text with the answers, including local inventory from the Shopping Graph. The tech giant says that this feature uses Duplex technology, "with a big Gemini model upgrade that helps us identify the best stores to call, suggest helpful questions to ask based on the product you want and summarize the conversations into key takeaways." Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Holiday sales can be totally overwhelming with so many stores offering huge discounts, and between all that craziness, it's easy to miss out on that dress you've been wanting forever or those pair of shoes that are only on sale for a few days. But that could change, as Google's new "agentic checkout" feature uses price-tracking to help you get desired items within your budget. So you can get down to the specifics by tracking an item by size, color, and desired price, and you'll be notified when the price drops on Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, and select Shopify merchants. If that wasn't enough, Google will then purchase it for you on the merchant's site using Google Pay, obviously after taking necessary permissions from you. This feature combines Gemini models and the Shopping Graph, saving you time and money this holiday season. These agentic shopping features are available in the U.S. starting today (Nov. 13), and Google says it has plans to roll them out to other countries soon.

Title: Deals: M4 MacBook Air $250 off, entry M5 MacBook Pro all-time low, Apple Watch SE 3 $200/Ultra 3 $99 off, more
URL: https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/13/deals-m4-macbook-air-m5-macbook-pro-apple-watch-se-3/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T16:45:00Z
Full Content:
Today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break is loaded with some big-time Apple price drops. Firstly, the all-time lows at $250 off across the M4 MacBook Air lineup have now returned, and we are now tracking a new Amazon all-time low on the most affordable M5 MacBook Pro at nearly $120 off. Those offers also join the best prices to date on Apple Watch Ultra 3 Alpine and Trail configs as well as all-time low pricing on the most affordable new Midnight Apple Watch SE 3 at $200. All of that is detailed for you below alongside this $300 price drop Apple’s Space Black 1TB M4 iPad Pro cell model. Deals on Apple’s latest MacBook releases are really starting to heat up as part of the early Black Friday festivities. All of the M4 MacBook Air models have now dropped back down to the lowest prices ever, we caught an upgraded M5 MacBook Pro at a new all-time low yesterday, and Amazon just served up the lowest price to date on the most affordable new M5 MacBook Pro at nearly $120 off. Amazon is now offering the 14-inch Space Black M5 MacBook Prowith 16GB of RAM and the 512GB SSD down at $1,481 shipped. Regularly $1,599, this is a new Amazon all-time low and the best price we have tracked yet in new condition with $118 slashed from the list. We recently featured a series of exclusive discounts on Apple’s brand new M5 machine – most of those offers remain the lowest prices we have seen to date, but Amazon has now picked it up a notch to deliver the lowest prices anywhere on the new 16GB models, including both the 512GB and 1TB storage options: We caught some early and quite impressive $99 price drops on the brand new Apple Watch Ultra 3 as part of the major early Black Friday offers. At the time that was largely just for Costco members or only on the new Ocean Band configurations elsewhere, but this morning Amazon has put a number of the Alpine and Trail Loop at $99 off as well. Amazon is still offering the same price drops we featured previously on the Ocean Band models, but you will now find a selection of the Apple Watch Ultra 3 configswith the new 2025 Alpine Loop and Trail Loops marked down to $699.99 shipped – a new Amazon all-time low price at $99 under the regular $799 list price. As you can see in the list above, we are also adding the Natural Apple Watch Ultra 3 with the matching Natural Titanium Milanese Loop to the list as well. This one, as you likely already know, fetches a premium because of the higher-end metal Milanese Loop, but it is also now $99 off and sitting at the best price we have ever tracked on Amazon. While not a perfect comparison because it was effectively just a new black color last year, the best official deal we tracked on Apple Watch Ultra 2 (currently down at $650) for Black Friday 2024 was the $80 price drop ushered in by Best Buy’s Black Friday Doorbusters and over at Amazon. We could see the series 3 go for less, but landing Apple’s brand new flagship wearable at nearly $100 off is certainly a solid price drop this soon after release. We caught our very first deal on Apple’s new Midnight 44mm Midnight SE 3 wearable the other day. It went completely out of stock before making a return yesterday – it is still live at the moment – and now the most affordable Midnight model in the new collection is live at its $199.99 all-time low. Amazon is now offering the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3 in the Midnight colorway down at $199.99 shipped. Regularly $249, this is nearly $49 off and the best price we have ever tracked. While this one did drop to the same $200 we have here now at a few days ago, it almost immediately went out of stock and remained unavailable until this morning. Considering almost no one had a chance at this deal earlier in the week, today’s offer is effectively the first chance to score a notable price drop on the most affordable Midnight Apple Watch SE 3 – the most affordable 2025 Apple Watch – and a new Amazon all-time low. This year’s new Apple Watch SE model is the most compelling model Apple has ever released if you ask me. It is, by and large, for just about anyone but the most hardcore users, effectively an Apple Watch Series 10 with less color options. It runs on the same S10 chip and finally supports an always-on display (a must-have for me) as well as double-tap and wrist-flick gesture support. It’s clearly not a Series-grade Apple Watch, but starting at $200 it’s awfully close and much more affordable – the most affordable Series 11 starts at $389 on Amazon. Amazon is landing this morning with one of the best discounts we have ever tracked on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. While we have seen a countless number of opportunities to save big on iPhone 16 Pro configurations, particularly deep 16 Pro Max offers have been a little bit harder to come by. However, this morning you’ll find the 1TB Black Titanium model at $540 off the original list price. Amazon is now offering the Black Titanium 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max down at $1,059 shipped in Renewed Premium condition with a 1-year warranty and a 90-day return guarantee. You’re looking at a spec’d out, upgraded iPhone 16 Pro Max that released in late 2024 at $1,599. While Apple no longer sells this model, as it has been replaced by the 17 Pro Max for the same price, this is indeed $540 off the price you would have paid for it straight from Apple not more than a couple months ago. And all things considered, if it has taken this long for Amazon to serve up an all-time low price on the 16 Pro, you might be waiting until this time next year to see the same on the 17 Pro/Max. The $1,059 asking price here might seem like a lot for a renewed iPhone, but this is the highest-quality refurb Amazon offers and one of the best sources for relatively new iPhone deals there is. I might even suggest it is the best way to land an unlocked iPhone 16 Pro/Max anywhere, even if you have the cash to buy a brand new unit. For more insight on what Apple’s latest handset releases deliver, here’s our hands-on review of the new iPhone 17 Pro. With all of the new M5 talk and fancy new Apple Watch releases, and the all-new AirPods Pro 3, never mind the all-time low pricing on M4 MacBook Air models, one of the best and most value-packed current-generation machines might be slipping under your radar – M4 Mac mini. I have been raving about this machine for a long while now, and with early Black Friday pricing now live, and our recent follow-up video review after 1 year in the lab, we wanted to make sure these deals are front and center. There’s no denying how convenient a MacBook can be – it is effectively just as good a home office computer as it is a portable solution – but it’s going to cost you a whole lot more than the Mac mini. And while I certainly value the freedom Apple’s battery-powered Macs provide, the M4 Mac mini has been the best and most useful Apple purchase I have made in recent memory. If you need to be able to pick up and go with your Mac system, then the Mac mini clearly isn’t for you, but if you don’t or you’re just looking to land a solid new at-home setup without completely running up the credit card, there’s simply nothing better if you ask me. You can get the same on-screen macOS experience as the MacBook for $250 less than the most affordable current-generation MacBook, and that’s with the all-time low Black Friday pricing right now.

Title: ‘Big Short’ investor Michael Burry deregisters Scion hedge fund amid bets against AI titans
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/11/13/business/big-short-investor-michael-burry-deregisters-scion-hedge-fund-amid-bets-against-ai-titans/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T16:32:20Z
Full Content:
Michael Burry, the investor whose successful bets against the US housing market in 2008 were recounted in the movie “The Big Short,” is closing his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management. In a letter to investors dated Oct. 27, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Burry said he would liquidate the funds and return capital, “but for a small audit/tax holdback” by the end of the year. A person directly familiar with the matter confirmed the contents of the letter. “My estimation of value in securities is not now, and has not been for some time, in sync with the markets,” Burry said in the letter. Burry could not be immediately reached for comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s database showed Scion’s registration status as “terminated” as of Nov. 10. Deregistering would imply the fund is not required to file reports with the regulator or any state. Investment funds that manage more than $100 million of capital are required to register with the SEC. Bets by Scion, which managed $155 million in assets as of March, have long been dissected for hints of looming bubbles and signs of market froth. In a post on social media platform X on Wednesday, Burry said, “On to much better things Nov 25th.” Scion Asset Management did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Burry, who was famously featured in the book and movie ‘The Big Short’, has stepped up criticism of technology heavyweights, including Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, in recent weeks, questioning the cloud infrastructure boom and accusing major providers of using aggressive accounting to inflate profits from their massive hardware investments. In his post on X, Burry said he spent about $9.2 million buying up about 50,000 put options on Palantir, saying that the options would allow him to sell the stock at $50 apiece in 2027. The put options convey the right to sell shares at a set price in the future and are typically bought to express a bearish or defensive view. Palantir’s shares were trading at $178.29 on Thursday, giving the company a market value of $422.36 billion. So, I bought 50,000 of these things for $1.84.Each of those things is 100 doodads. So I spent $9,200,000, Not $912,000,000. @CNBC @WSJ @FTEach of those doodads let me sell $PLTR at $50 in 2027. That was done last month. On to much better things Nov 25th. pic.twitter.com/9Voy3nwiTD Last month, Burry posted an image of his character from ‘The Big Short’ movie and warned of bubbles, saying that, “Sometimes the only winning move is not to play.” “Burry’s decision feels less like ‘calling it quits’ and more like stepping away from a game he believes is fundamentally rigged,” said Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management. Burry, who could not be immediately reached for comment, has argued that as companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet-owned Google, Oracle and Meta pour billions into Nvidia chips and servers, they are also quietly stretching out depreciation schedules to make earnings look smoother. Between 2026 and 2028, those accounting choices could understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported profits across the sector, he estimated. AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of the S&P 500 index’s returns since November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, JPMorgan Asset Management wrote in September. “Don’t count him out, just expect him to operate off the grid for a while. He may simply pivot to a family-office setup and run his own capital,” said Schneller. The investor’s short position against subprime mortgage securities during the housing market crash was chronicled in Michael Lewis’s book, “The Big Short,” and its film adaptation. His profile on X, titled “Cassandra Unchained,” is seen as a nod to the Greek mythological figure cursed by Apollo to deliver true prophecies that no one would believe. Investment advisers with assets under management of $100 million or more have to register with the SEC, and are primarily subject to federal regulation instead of state regulation. Burry’s Scion ended last year with shares in American Coastal, Bruker, Canada Goose, HCA Healthcare, Magnera, Molina Healthcare, Oscar Health and VF Corp, but the firm ended those bets earlier this year. During the quarter ended June 30, Burry’s Scion Asset Management was more bullish on companies across different sectors and geographies, after betting against Chinese companies previously as the Trump administration considered imposing tariffs. Burry, who launched Scion Asset Management in 2013, joins a cast of high-profile investors navigating a market that has become increasingly hostile to bearish views in recent years, thanks to unfettered optimism around technology and strong interest from retail investors. Hindenburg Research shuttered earlier this year after a string of high-profile calls, including bets against India’s Adani Group and electric-truck maker Nikola. Veteran short seller Jim Chanos, best known for his bets against energy trader Enron months before the company’s bankruptcy, has also sparred with Michael Saylor’s bitcoin holding company Strategy. Chanos has argued that Strategy’s valuation premium was unjustified, a critique that drew a sharp response from Saylor. Advertisement

For a long time, I thought prediction markets, “superforecasting”, and AI forecasting techniques had nothing to say about the stock market. Stock prices already reflect the collective wisdom of investors. The stock market is basically a prediction market already.Recently, though, AI forecasting has gotten competitive with human forecasters. And we’ve found a way of modeling long-term company outcomes that is amenable to our forecasting approach.Iteration by iteration, my skepticism has turned to light distrust, and then into actually getting value out of our company forecasts. Like most AI companies, we draw from improvements against our LLM-agent benchmarks, Deep Research Bench and Bench to the Future.But at the end of the day, to evaluate it, I think it’s best to follow Charlie Munger’s advice: try to disprove what Stockfisher says. Now, even after an hour of carefully reading through a stock, I generally can’t find any major flaws, and I hear the same from other serious investors.And, since it’s software, not human analysis, we applied it at scale. We have long-term forecasts for revenue, margins, and payout ratios for every company in the S&P 500.We do a Buffett-style intrinsic valuation, that doesn’t take the stock price into account. This means you can sort by the difference between what the stock market says, and what Stockfisher says. Some very interesting neglected companies rise to the top, and we’re starting to process the mid-caps and small-caps too.Stockfisher is live at https://platform.stockfisher.app, no sign in required, to see what we have on the top stocks. (I was happy to see Alphabet comes out well. Meta looks good too, but Amazon and Apple do not.) I would love for you to judge for yourself if the quality of analysis is up to your standards.

But they do get certain things right. And if you figure out the patterns of what types of manager promises tend to play out, and assess them individually for their reliability, you can reason about these business model changes decently well. reply reply The most interesting aspect of this is backtesting. Quant models get run on past data to see if their predictions work.When you use LLMs agents, though, you run into their memorized knowledge of the world. And then there's the fact that they do their research on the open internet. It makes backtesting hard - but not impossible.We wrote about how we do our pastcasting validation here: https://stockfisher.app/backtesting-forecasts-that-use-llms When you use LLMs agents, though, you run into their memorized knowledge of the world.

You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. In today’s "Crypto for Advisors" newsletter, Aaron Brogan from Brogan Law breaks down the history and business model of digital asset treasuries. Then, in "Ask an Expert", DJ Windle from Windle Wealth answers questions that advisors need to know about crypto treasury companies. – Sarah Morton Digital asset treasury (DAT) companies offer public crypto exposure, but how much hype are you buying? The digital asset treasury (DAT) company is a new invention with a long history. They are public companies pursuing an explicit priority of purchasing digital assets. Back in 1989, Michael Saylor founded MicroStrategy (now Strategy) as a software business. It achieved some success and went public in 1998, only to spectacularly implode in 2000, lose more than 99% of its market cap, and catch an SEC investigation. Improbably, though, Strategy did not go bankrupt in 2000, and continues to offer obscure software and services today. The magic happened elsewhere, though. In 2020, the firm began purchasing bitcoin, and it hasn’t stopped. At first, its approach appeared to be rabid evangelism. Saylor would buy bitcoin, go on TV and convince others to buy bitcoin, and that would drive the company’s investment up. But over time, another phenomenon appeared. As Strategy bought more and more bitcoin, and the price of bitcoin climbed ever higher, Strategy increasingly became a box of bitcoins with a vestigial software company stapled onto it. At this point, its share price and market cap should have converged to the price of bitcoin, but it didn’t. It traded at a premium. When this happened, promoters stirred from their hoards like Smaug, and the DAT was born. This multiple of a DATs net asset value (NAV) and its market cap, known as its multiple of NAV (mNAV), creates a special kind of power. If you can buy an asset for $1, and increase your market cap by $2, then you should do nothing else. You can sell equity, and indeed raise debt, and put it to immediate direct productive use accreting shareholder value. As long as this relationship holds, it is, in essence, a money printer. And so as Strategy ran this playbook over time, others took notice. They started to get the idea that maybe they could follow it, and make their own DAT. Some used BTC, like Mara Holdings, Inc., but over time others tried it with other assets like Ether ETH$3,066.85, held by Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc., and Solana SOL$137.90, held by Forward Industries, Inc., as well. Source: Galaxy Research For the promoters of these projects, the value proposition is clear. Asymmetric increases in equity value, coupled with public trading, lead to quick profits. BTC has always been highly liquid, but for virtually all other digital assets, creating a public sink to purchase tokens presents the dazzling potential to increase asset values and provide exit liquidity in a single stroke. This is a major reason that the meta has gained so much traction recently. It is good for bagholders. But what about purchasers? Well, getting access to a DAT stock before its mNAV grows is good, as the company implements its strategy and, hopefully, gains value, equity holders may see gains. But for an ordinary buyer on public markets, after a positive mNAV is established, the value proposition is speculative. You are buying a premium on the underlying asset, and that premium could easily fade. Historically, access to Strategy was valuable to institutional advisors who were hesitant or legally unable to purchase bitcoin directly for their clients. They could hold Strategy instead. But as old taboos fade, and regulatory disapprobation with it, this proposition may lose luster. At the same time, exchange-traded products (ETPs) that skip the step of wrapping a treasury in an operating company have been approved recently, further diluting DAT’s advantage. There is also the regulatory question. Strategy is not a ‘40 Act Fund because BTC is not a security, but it is not obvious that the same reasoning would apply to DATs holding other assets. A future administration unfriendly to the industry could test the operating company exemption on which they rely. To the extent that DATs use leverage to acquire assets, future market instability could lead to liquidations, increasing risk. Premiums, too, may be collapsing even now. Chart: Strategy performance vs. bitcoin (Source: strategtracker.com) For advisors, understanding these different risk vectors is critical to advising clients on a DAT buying strategy. Regulatory risk is unlikely to be significant in the current environment, but premium collapse could be, so understanding a DAT’s mNAV at purchase is critical to evaluating its risk profile. Leverage, too, can increase risk profile. Finally, DATs may change strategy more readily than a comparable ETP, and so monitoring developments in management is another important factor to consider. - Aaron Brogan, founder and managing attorney, Brogan Law Q: What should advisors understand before clients start asking about digital asset treasury companies? A: Advisors don’t need to master every nuance of on-chain finance, but they do need to grasp what makes a digital asset treasury (DAT) company behave differently from a traditional stock. These companies hold large amounts of crypto on their balance sheets, and their share prices often move with those assets rather than their business fundamentals. When clients bring them up, they’re really asking: “Is this a safe way to own crypto in my brokerage account?” The best preparation is to understand that DATs function as leveraged proxies for digital assets. They can trade far above (or below) the value of their holdings depending on market sentiment, leverage, and liquidity. Being able to explain that dynamic clearly separates education from hype. Q: How can advisors evaluate whether a DAT makes sense for a portfolio? A: Start with what drives the stock. A DAT’s share price reflects not just the value of its crypto treasury but also investor sentiment, leverage, and liquidity. Advisors should review three things: Advisors can then reframe client enthusiasm around fundamentals. Is the goal diversified exposure or speculation on a premium? That distinction determines whether a DAT belongs anywhere near a client’s portfolio. Q: What should advisors be ready to explain when clients compare DATs to spot ETFs? A: This will be the most common question. The answer is that spot ETFs hold the digital asset directly, trade close to net asset value, and operate under clear regulation. DATs, on the other hand, are companies using corporate balance sheets to hold those same assets and sometimes using debt to do it. That means the potential upside can look exciting, but the risk profile is closer to a leveraged stock than an ETF. Advisors should prepare to discuss taxation, concentration risk, and how DATs might react differently from the underlying crypto. Helping clients see that difference turns a speculative headline into a teachable moment about structure, liquidity, and risk tolerance. - DJ Windle, founder and portfolio manager, Windle Wealth Más para ti Protocol Research: GoPlus Security Lo que debes saber: More For You CoinDesk 20 Performance Update: Internet Computer Drops 13.2%, Leading Index Lower Cronos (CRO) joined Internet Computer (ICP) as an underperformer, falling 5.8% over the weekend.

Title: Nancy Pelosi Is Retiring up 595%, but She’s Still Holding on to These 3 Stocks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images News via Getty Images Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement last week. She has been a leading voice in Congress for decades, and her term will end in January 2027. She’s currently holding on to many stocks, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) being the latest buys. Pelosi hasn’t been without controversy, with stock trading being one of the biggest concerns of her critics. It should be noted that Nancy Pelosi’s stock trades are not directly hers. Her husband, Paul Pelosi, is the person buying and selling stocks, though these trades are still attributed to her, as she is likely legally entitled to a significant portion of them, upon a possible divorce or her husband’s passing. At the same time, there are concerns that Nancy Pelosi will be passing information to her husband. These claims are not proven. But what is proven is that the Pelosis have had remarkable wins over the course of their investing history. Since mid-2014, her strategy has yielded her 858.58% in gains, whereas the S&P 500 only returned 263.2%. This is a 595% outperformance over the S&P 500. Let’s take a look at the three stocks she holds now. Nvidia is Pelosi’s biggest holding, with 20% of her portfolio being in this one stock. Her latest trade was on January 14, 2025, and was disclosed on January 17. She purchased 50 call options with a strike price of $80 and an expiration date of January 16, 2026. Since that trade, NVDA stock is up 47.09%. If the options were to be exercised today, she would have a total of $569,000 in NVDA stock. To find the true profits, you’d have to exclude the premium paid for all these options, the exact amount of which is not known. Alphabet is her second-biggest holding, with 15% of her portfolio in GOOGL stock. Her latest transaction was on January 14, 2025, and was filed three days later on January 17. She bought 50 call options on GOOGL stock, with each option representing 100 shares. This has been a very profitable buy, with GOOGL stock up more than 46% since that transaction took place. Since these are options, Pelosi will be able to exercise 5,000 shares of GOOGL at the strike price of $150. If these options were to be exercised today, she would have $683,550 in GOOGL stock. This is a well-timed trade, and Pelosi is very likely to exercise these options by the time they expire and then hold GOOGL stock directly. Broadcom also has the same weight as Alphabet at 15%. Her most recent AVGO trade happened on June 20, 2025, and it was disclosed on July 9. She exercised 20 call options that were purchased on June 24, 2024 (20,000 shares post-split). President Donald Trump announced a $70 billion investment in AI and energy, less than a month after Pelosi exercised those options. AVGO stock is up 42.09% since the call options were exercised, but her initial call options trade made even more money. Pelosi bought 20 call options on AVGO with an $800 strike price and an expiry of June 20, 2025. This was three weeks before AVGO went through a 10-for-1 stock split. AVGO stock gained over 50% from June 24, 2024, to June 20, 2025.

Title: This is how MAGA falls

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/13/2025 5:30:32 AM PST by lasereye As in his first term, Donald Trump now presides over a visibly sinking ship as his approval ratings slide. MAGA, a movement built around the personality of one man, never amounted to a coherent political force or even a workable coalition. Claims that Trump and his lieutenants won a mandate in 2024 and then ‘saved’ the country were always delusional. After all, his margin was thin, as was that of his party in Congress. Three forces are killing MAGA, perhaps even pushing the US in a distinctly socialist direction. The first are the internal divisions, which are growing ever-more pronounced and will only intensify as an aging Trump becomes an ever-lamer duck, particularly if Democrats romp to victory again in the 2026 midterms. The second, arguably more serious, weakness lies in the loss of the Latino vote – a growing political force in many states. Many Latinos shifted to Trump in 2024, but the brutality of the ICE crackdown, reported with typical zeal by his media foes, has eroded his appeal, as seen in results from New York, New Jersey and Virginia. The third, and most fatal, factor is the economy, whose troubles may have begun under Biden but now belong to Trump. Pressured by investors and accelerated by the rise of artificial intelligence, the US has produced an economy in which major companies, particularly in tech, are shedding workers even as they post record profits. It’s not a good look, especially given that under Trump the 10 richest Americans grew richer by an astounding $700 billion. The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Many Latinos shifted to Trump in 2024, but the brutality of the ICE crackdown, reported with typical zeal by his media foes, has eroded his appeal, as seen in results from New York, New Jersey and Virginia. The third, and most fatal, factor is the economy, whose troubles may have begun under Biden but now belong to Trump. Pressured by investors and accelerated by the rise of artificial intelligence, the US has produced an economy in which major companies, particularly in tech, are shedding workers even as they post record profits. It’s not a good look, especially given that under Trump the 10 richest Americans grew richer by an astounding $700 billion. The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

If that continues, 2026 and 2028 will not be good. I believe those large deals Trump has made to bring manufacturing back will start bearing fruit during the term of the next President. Unfortunately, there's a good chance a Democrat President will be taking credit for those jobs. 1 posted on 11/13/2025 5:30:32 AM PST by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye There isn’t going to be any 2026 Mid-term!

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats.

Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes.

As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Title: Don't Chase Google, Meta: IBM Chief Scientist Urges Graduates To Examine Sectors Outside Silicon Valley
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/dont-chase-google-meta-ibm-chief-scientist-urges-graduates-to-examine-sectors-outside-silicon-valley

IBM Chief Scientist Ruchir Puri urged tech graduates to explore avenues beyond chasing after the prestige of Silicon Valley tech giants such as Google, Meta or Microsoft. He encouraged them to instead look into those sectors and industries where they find potential for innovation, in light of the turbulence in the job market primarily stemming from AI. "Stop only chasing the tech giants everyone else is pining after," Puri said, indicating that software engineers have niches they can thrive in beyond large tech companies. "Artificial intelligence is transforming every sector — from agriculture to retail — and meaningful work is happening everywhere," he said in an interview with Business Today. Puri used the example of agricultural manufacturing company John Deere which have used AI and automation to optimise its operations in innovative ways. The firm has pioneered ecofriendly and economical ways to engage in weeding, such as the 'spot and spray' method, where cameras and AI are used to find and target individual weeds, helping farmer cut costs and reduce damage to crops. “Graduates often overlook such enterprises while focusing narrowly on Silicon Valley,” Puri said. He asked freshers to see beyond "a narrow set of tech companies" and to look to the "massive enterprise landscape". His comments can also be contextualised with the increasing number of lay-offs and lower job demand in tech companies with the advent of AI automation. Job postings reduced 16% year-over-year, according to an August report from Handshake, at the same time, applications per posting went up 26% showing the gap between demand and supply. Tech conglomerates such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and Amazon have announced waves of layoffs in 2025. IBM also stated earlier in the month that it would get rid of thousands of positions across the globe in the fourth quarter. However the firm also said that its planning to ramp up hiring young graduates for AI-centred positions, according statements chief executive officer Arvidn Krishna made to CNN in an interview. “People are talking about layoffs or hiring freezes, but I actually want to say we are the opposite,” Krishna said. “We expect to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in recent years," he added.

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit Job cuts made at Brandtech group media agency Jellyfish may be the latest symptom of a contracting advertising and marketing job market. The company cut as many as 50 roles at the end of October, following a slowdown in client spending, Digiday has learned. “Our existing clients were spending less money, some of those were retracting the projects that they had planned, and that obviously led to a revenue hit,” said one exec whose role was cut in the layoffs and who spoke on condition of anonymity. Jellyfish confirmed the cuts. “Like everyone in marketing, our business is dynamic and we are constantly making shifts in our resources, redesigning roles and structures,” said a spokesperson. “At 8% we have one of the lowest churn rates in the industry. Currently there is a very small number of roles affected in the U.S. and U.K.” Those let go face difficult circumstances. One ad-tech executive made redundant earlier this year, who exchanged candor for anonymity, told Digiday that 11 months on, they were still without a permanent position. Compared with previous job markets, they said new positions were thinner on the ground. “Back then I could walk out of a job and walk into five interviews the following day. Now, I can’t get the interview,” they said. “It’s a tough market.” Jellyfish’s cuts are small, compared with the job losses at holding company agencies in recent months. Forrester analysis suggests agency headcounts have fallen 8% in 2025. In August, Dentsu committed to eliminating 3,400 jobs worldwide, approximately 8% of its staff. WPP, meanwhile, cut 7,000 during the final months of Mark Read’s CEO tenure; 700 came from Ogilvy alone. Interpublic Group has laid off 3,200 employees this year, while its to-be acquirer Omnicom already cut its global headcount by 3,000 jobs in 2024 and has been working to reduce staff costs by 10% in the run-up to that merger’s completion. Once the deal is complete, it expects to find $750 million in cost savings — given labor costs always lead the balance sheet, that’s not great news for the thousands working under each umbrella. “Layoffs have become the new normal,” said the former Jellyfish exec. But industry job losses aren’t limited to agencies. In October, TikTok cut 400 jobs in the U.K. from its Trust and Safety Team, while Target cut 1,800 white-collar positions, and Amazon recently announced plans to reduce its corporate workforce by 14,000 roles. CPG giant Nestlé plans to cut 12,000 office staff. Between August and December 2024 (the most recent data), the American ad industry lost 4,600 roles overall according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And data from Britain’s Office for National Statistics showed job openings in the advertising and marketing industries had fallen 7.5% between 2022 and 2025. That’s set against rising unemployment in the U.S. (4.3% in August) and the U.K. (5% in September); U.S. firms, particularly retailers, announced the most job cuts for any October in more than 20 years according to a Thursday report from global outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Some of the firms responsible have laid out their own justifications for reducing headcount. A historic merger here; long-term underperformance there; a restructuring ahead of a potential sale. Add them all together, and a pattern emerges. “What we’re seeing is layoffs as a result of restructuring and financial distress,” said Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester, who referenced an estimate by Madison & Wall that suggested the four largest holdcos averaged just 0.3% organic growth in Q3, the lowest for five years. “If you’ve got a category that is in effect growing less than 1% then yes, they’re shedding jobs, because jobs are the number one overhead,” he added. This year’s job cuts can be traced to restructuring and client cutbacks. But generative AI is the ghost at the leaving party. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet,” said Beth Galetti, svp of people experience and technology at Amazon, in an Oct. 28 blog post sent to Amazon employees. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Naveen Tewari, CEO of ad tech firm InMobi, warned in February that AI progress meant his software engineers “will not have jobs within two years.” Statements like Tewari’s are leaving marketing execs looking for their next role worried they’re going to be frozen out, experience be damned. The anonymous ad tech exec voiced fears that older workers could be disproportionately affected, and that a perception they’re less adept with gen AI tools could be used as cover for ageist discrimination. 40% of advertising staffers aged between 40 and 55 feel their age has limited their career, according to research by the IPA and the Advertising Association. “It does start to feel like ageism and a slight white male-ism,” they said. Pattisall suggested that while this year’s layoffs can be primarily traced to restructuring pushes, next year’s will be provoked by AI. Two years ago, Forrester predicted that AI, automation and efficiency initiatives would result in a net 7.5% reduction in the U.S. advertising workforce. Its most recent report upgraded that estimate to 15% by the end of next year. Again, this isn’t limited to ad agencies. Over a quarter of private-sector employers expect to cut staff as a result of AI, according to a survey of 2,000 firms by the Chartered Institue of Personnel and Development, the U.K. professional body for HR. 62% said they believed that admin and managerial roles were most at risk. “The technology was nascent when we developed that forecast in in mid-2023,” explained Pattisall. “We had not factored for agentic and agents. I think we’ll see a larger percentage of the advertising population that can be replaced by those tools.” — Jessica Davies contributed reporting to this story The longstanding divide between marketing and communications is eroding — not with a bang but with a slow, steady merging of responsibilities. LinkedIn’s head of ads measurement, Jae Oh, explains why he believes the platform is “phenomenally cheaper” than others in the market. The EC’s Digital Omnibus could redefine data rules — and shift power in digital advertising.
