I am only trying to iron out that situation where the US market falls 20-25%, then this oil fall and all will not matter.

Title: Fidelity crypto IRAs make their debut – All you need to know!

Will Fidelity flip BlackRock’s crypto dominance anytime soon? Fidelity Investments is making waves in the crypto space once again, expanding its digital asset offerings beyond Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). In a significant move, the brokerage firm has launched a crypto-focused Individual Retirement Account (IRA), allowing U.S. investors over 18 in eligible states to directly invest in Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Litecoin [LTC]. With this latest initiative, Fidelity will continue to bridge traditional finance with crypto, offering investors a new gateway into digital assets. Fidelity’s new crypto IRA product comes at a time when financial advisors are increasingly incorporating digital assets into their client portfolios. In fact, according to a recent survey by TMX Vetta Fi, 57% of advisors plan to expand their allocations to crypto ETFs, with a strong emphasis on crypto equity ETFs. That being said, Fidelity’s crypto IRA options offer investors a flexible path to secure their retirement. Custodied by Fidelity Digital Assets and stored in cold wallets, this IRA product comes with zero fees and supports Roth, traditional, and rollover IRA options. The Fidelity Crypto Roth IRA provides tax-free growth potential, while the Fidelity Crypto Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth. Additionally, the Fidelity Crypto Rollover IRA offers tax-deferred growth for those rolling over existing retirement accounts. This gives users a stress-free solution for integrating crypto into their long-term financial plans. Needless to say, Fidelity’s performance in the ETF market has been impressive, with its spot Bitcoin ETF, FBTC, recording $118.8 million in inflows. It even surpassed BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $115.9 million in outflows on 2 April. However, its spot Ethereum ETF is yet to attract any significant flows, according to Farside Investors. With Fidelity now expanding its crypto offerings, it even filed to list a Solana [SOL] ETF on the Cboe Exchange, signaling its growing commitment to the digital asset space. Additionally, reports suggest that Fidelity’s digital assets division is preparing tests for a potential stablecoin venture. However, no immediate plans for release have been announced yet. This strategic move positions Fidelity to remain a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. Especially as market dynamics continue to shift.

Impact would be different on different sectors however there is a real risk of all round slowdown in global economies and specifically in US economy which could impact on overall growth across the globe. We are still evaluating impact individually on various sectors and portfolio companies however we are cautiously watching the developments and would do realignments as necessary”. Post the new governor coming in, the RBI’s stance has been reasonably dovish and responsive to the market concerns especially regarding liquidity in the system. Steps taken including the OMOs have resulted in benchmark G-sec rates rallying by ~25-30 bps in this short span of time. Having said that, the upcoming policy would be tricky from the perspective of a volatile global economic scenario with the US imposing a series of tariffs on most of their trading partners including India. The short to medium term impact of the same is expected to be inflationary which may potentially lead to US rates rising. That in turn may put upward pressure on Indian G-sec as well. Hence the RBI may decide to hold rates for now and let the “tariff tantrum” play out. 1.

Source: Reuters The President of the United States has announced more hawkish-than-expected reciprocal tariffs on the trade partners of the US. Per our provisional calculations of the announced 27% reciprocal tariffs on India, could lead to 40bps drag on FY26E YoY nominal GDP growth at the worst. The covid-19 shock is testament to the fact that supply chains do not reorient quickly even when there is a relative comparative cost advantage. As such, our biggest worry at this point would be lower global growth led by US & China. If tariffs continue longer, we see a certain end to ‘US exceptionalism’ and an expansionary Fed, as growth risks may overshadow inflationary concerns. If RMB devaluation discussions emerge strongly, it may be a key global event to watch out for. US services activity moderates; trade deficit narrows The ISM Services PMI fell sharply to 50.8 in March 2025 from 53.5 in February, well below forecasts of 53. The reading pointed to the softest expansion in the services sector since June last year. In a separate release, US trade deficit narrowed to $122.7 billion in February 2025 from a record high of $130.7 billion in January Layoffs announced by U.S. employers surged in March Global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday that planned job cuts increased 60% to 275,240 last month, the highest level since May 2020. Challenger said it had over the past two months tracked 280,253 planned layoffs of federal workers and contractors impacting 27 agencies. Another 4,429 job cuts were from the downstream effect of cutting federal aid. India says studying impact of 27% US tariff India said on Thursday it was studying the impact of the 27% tariff slapped by the U.S. on its imports and vowed to push for a trade deal this year, signalling a conciliatory tone despite failing to get relief from President Donald Trump’s trade policy. New Delhi is also considering helping export sectors hurt by the new tariffs, an Indian trade ministry source to Reuters said. RBI maintains FPI investment caps in govt securities, corp bonds for FY26 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained the existing caps of 6 per cent for government securities, 2 per cent for state government securities and 15 per cent for corporate bonds for the current year starting April 1. The general limit for foreign investment in govt bonds would continue to be Rs 2.79 trillion ($32.71 billion) for April-September and Rs 2.89 trillion for October-March. Fitch Cuts China Rating on Weakening Finances, Debt Concerns The cut takes China’s long-term foreign currency default rating to ‘A’ from ‘A+’ with a stable outlook, Fitch said in a statement on Thursday. China’s Finance Ministry responded with a strong rebuke, describing the decision as biased and not reflective of reality. Asian markets Asian markets opened on a negative note as the US markets saw biggest drawdown since Covid crash. The concerns on China is likely to exert downside on the region’s asset classes. However, downside on the USD, Brent, and US yields may cap the downside.

However, while a recovery was observed, intraday volatility remained subdued, keeping traders cautious. Buyers managed to retain dominance throughout the session, with every minor dip being quickly absorbed. Yet, the index continued to oscillate within a well-defined range, creating a stiff resistance ceiling and a strong base, reflecting a lack of decisive direction in the market. Currently, Nifty has established robust support at the Fibonacci 0.382% retracement level of 23,141, signalling it as a strong demand zone at lower levels. The price action suggests a deadlock between bulls and bears, with repeated failures to break key support or resistance levels. Additionally, the index continues to trade below its 200-day EMA, a crucial technical barrier in the near term. With no firm breakout on either side, Nifty remains in a sideways trajectory, stuck in consolidation for the seventh consecutive session. On the technical front, RSI remains below 60, indicating a lack of bullish momentum. This setup points toward a continued consolidation phase, where key support and resistance levels dictate the price action. On the downside, support has shifted to the 23,100–23,000 zone, aligning with the 20 & 50-day EMAs, reinforcing this area as a critical demand zone. The Nifty ended the session at 23,250.10, slipping 0.35% (82.25 points), reflecting a cautiously optimistic sentiment amid upcoming macroeconomic events. With volatility likely to spike around the RBI’s monetary policy announcement, traders are closely watching for a directional breakout. Until then, the index is expected to remain range-bound, navigating a choppy and consolidative phase. Options Market Insights Derivative data signals a mildly bullish undertone, with put writers outpacing call writers, hinting at growing bullish sentiment. The 23,500 strike witnessed heavy call writing (47.34 lakh contracts), solidifying it as a formidable resistance zone. Conversely, substantial put writing at 23,000 (65.14 lakh contracts) highlights strong buyer interest at lower levels. The 23,000–23,100 range has evolved into a demand zone, supported by aggressive put writing, while the 23,300–23,500 range remains a supply zone, as steady call additions continue to act as an overhead barrier. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) climbed from 0.87 to 1.07, suggesting a shift toward optimistic positioning. With Max Pain at 23,250, bulls have been absorbing bearish attempts, hinting at potential upward pressure in the near term. Volatility Trends India VIX, the market’s fear gauge, eased 0.89% to 13.60, indicating diminished uncertainty. As long as VIX remains below 15, market conditions are likely to stay relatively stable, keeping volatility in check. Market Outlook Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, Nifty absorbed selling pressure well, forming a solid base at support levels and staging a gradual recovery despite muted intraday momentum. With both call and put writers strategically placing positions at key levels, market indecision remains dominant. The failure to break below support has boosted optimism, leading to renewed long positions. However, the index’s position below the 200-day EMA continues to present a major technical hurdle. RSI staying under 60, along with Nifty’s adherence to its 0.382% Fibonacci retracement level, reinforces a defined trading range, where both bulls and bears are actively defending their zones. The 23,500–23,350 region has become a strong supply zone, with persistent call writing flipping previous support into resistance. On the downside, 23,200–23,000 remains a crucial support area, backed by significant put additions and psychological importance. A decisive breakout above 23,300 could trigger bullish momentum, but with call writers maintaining a firm stance and steady put writing at lower levels, consolidation is likely to continue. As long as Nifty trades within 23,500–23,000, a buy-on-dips and sell-on-rise strategy remains favourable. However, a break above 23,300 could ignite short-covering, leading to further upside potential.

In early trading today, the Nikkei 225 index was down 1.9% at 34,058.23, following a drop of 2.77% on Thursday. Meanwhile, the broader Topix index fell by 2.81%, having experienced a loss of 3.08% the day before. - Agencies Global shock as Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, sparking threats of retaliation and calls for negotiation worldwide. Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head - Research & Outreach, ICRA Limited On India, the reciprocal tariff rate set by the US is 27%, which while quite high, is lower than some other Asian countries such as China (34%), Vietnam (46%), Thailand (37%), Bangladesh (37%), Taiwan (32%), etc. Notably, several items were excluded from the country-specific ad valorem rates. Our early assessment is that the impact of the tariff announcements up to today is negative for some sectors such as steel, non-ferrous metals, auto components and cut and polished diamonds. In our view, this poses a mild downside risk to our growth forecast. However, we suspect that the relative tariff scenario is going to continue to evolve as the year progresses. For now, we are maintaining our baseline GDP growth forecast of 6.5% for FY2026. As a result, we continue to expect the MPC to reduce the repo rate by 25 bps next week, based on the expectation of a moderation in the CPI inflation to 4.2% on average in FY2026. A final rate cut of 25 bps may be forthcoming in the June or August 2025 policy review, based on the evolving growth inflation dynamics India's electronics industry aims to leverage tariff advantages over China and Vietnam, emphasizing the need for strategic trade agreements. India's IT sector resilient to US tariffs, emphasizing AI, cybersecurity, and enterprise tech solutions, but reciprocal tariffs may pressure industries.

Title: Redefining Resilience: Natural Capital & Wildfire Risk

This group brings together the best thinkers on energy and climate. Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going. Post Athena Intelligence is a data vendor with a geospatial, conditional, profiling tool that pulls together vast amounts of disaggregated wildfire and environmental data to generate spatial... Across industries, there is a redefinition of value occurring. Traditional financial metrics—centered around earnings, return on assets and financial capital—are increasingly inadequate in the face of systemic risks like climate change, biodiversity loss, and intensifying wildfires. For electric utilities operating in fire-prone landscapes, the path forward is clear: build resilience by understanding and integrating natural capital into core business decisions. Natural Capital IS Financial Capital According to a report by Blackrock, more than half of global GDP—roughly $58 trillion—is moderately or highly dependent on nature. For utilities, this dependence is direct. Power lines traverse forests, transmission infrastructure crosses watersheds, and vegetation management now represents one of the largest operational expenditures in wildfire-prone regions. In short, utilities don’t just impact nature—their economic viability depends on how they interact with it. The first industry to recognize this was agriculture - where weather volatility directly impacts their product quantity and quality. Athena Intelligence's origins are in AgTech and harvest projection. Our understanding of vegetation, terrain and weather trends gives us a unique perspective on your challenges with wildfire. Until recent changes in accounting requirements, the value of this “natural capital”—forests, biodiversity, water, and land—was largely invisible on balance sheets. This is changing. Some public companies have secured billions in sustainability-linked loans by embedding environmental performance into financial strategy. The same logic applies to utilities: the better a utility understands its relationship with nature, the better it can access capital, attract investors, and work with groups like Blue Forest. As utilities develop and refine Wildfire Mitigation Plans (WMPs), there is an opportunity to go beyond CYA-compliance, while reducing expenses. A terrain aware and nature-focused approach aligns wildfire mitigation with ecosystem stewardship— reducing flammable fuel loads, and supporting biodiversity—all while protecting critical infrastructure and communities. Initiatives like the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) are already influencing capital flows. Similar to how climate-related risks are increasingly priced into a utility's bonds, nature-related risks are beginning to shape investor expectations. BlackRock’s own research acknowledges that natural capital is not just an ESG issue—it’s a material financial risk. (TNFD Guidance for Water Utilities was issued January 2025.) Utilities that proactively assess and disclose their natural capital dependencies and impacts will be better positioned in capital markets. Those that don’t risk being left behind, especially as insurance markets tighten and cost of capital increases in high wildfire risk zones. For other industries, the global economy is shifting from an “output economy” focused on production and profit to an “impact economy” where consumers seek brands focused on organic production, customer wellbeing and health. The utility equivalent is resilience, sustainability and long-term viability. For your team, this shift is both a challenge and an opportunity. By redefining success to include nature, community, public health and water quality—not just financial performance—utility executives can lead their organizations toward a more climate-resilient future. This includes: Embedding wildfire and nature risk into financial models and board-level strategy. Recognizing and reporting on ecosystem services such as forest health, water quality, and biodiversity. Disclosing material natural capital dependencies and impacts in the context of today's cost savings and the longer-term public health savings by avoiding the impact of wildfires. Aligning wildfire mitigation investments with community resilience. The tools, frameworks, and investor interest are already in motion. What’s needed now is leadership at the local level. As the stewards of critical infrastructure and vast service areas, utility executives have both the responsibility and the opportunity to redefine what resilience looks like in the 21st century. That starts by valuing nature—not just as a risk to be managed, but as a form of capital to be protected, enhanced, and accounted for. Boston Consulting Group just did a paper on this topic. It starts: As we progress through the second half of this decade, corporate climate action is becoming an increasingly vexing challenge. Evidence is mounting that the tangible impacts of climate change are being felt now, and stakeholders are demanding action. As 2030 climate targets approach, companies are increasingly having to integrate their climate action into their strategic capital allocation decisions. Unfortunately, achieving these targets is proving harder and more expensive than anticipated, partly due to rising project and capital costs in the post-COVID era. Adding to the pressure, the stakes and compliance costs are escalating. Heightened scrutiny from the ACCC and ASIC, coupled with recent legislation on Mandatory Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, requires companies to have credible plans and assess risks across a range of uncertain, and often unknowable, future scenarios. It’s getting complicated.

Title: NYTimes: Trump Deportations Will Raise Wages
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/04/03/nytimes-trump-deportations-will-raise-wages/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T21:43:50Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump’s deportations may give a 17 percent wage gain to American construction workers, according to the New York Times. The wage gain is predicted by a New York Times article that described how cheap migrant labor helped a builder prepare a $2.65 million home for sale to wealthy Americans. Without immigrant workers, Mr. Anderson’s labor costs could jump by 17 percent, adding $116,000 to his budget, the article lamented: A shock to the labor market by a loss of workers through deportation and the fear of deportation could potentially drive up wages … Without immigrant workers, [builder Nathan] Anderson’s labor costs could jump by 17 percent, adding $116,000 to his budget. “Why is that so bad?” said a puzzled Steven Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, adding: In this particular example … someone in the top 1 percent or 1/10 of 1 percent can afford that house, but they’re going to have to pay some more for it. Yet aat the same time, working class Americans– bricklayers, concrete workers, carpenters, what have you — are going to make more money. So it seems like a really good redistribution of income from the very top to more middle-income people. That would be good. The $2.65 million house was priced at almost six times the average cost for a new home in Arizona. The New York Times reporter, Ronda Kaysen, explained how the cost of the building’s foundation, for example, would rise by 20 percent: Last September, once the architectural drawings were complete, the building permits approved and the site prepared for construction, a crew arrived to lay the foundation, costing about $59,000. On the busiest days, as many as eight workers were on site. Some days, as few as three or four. Almost 70 percent, or $40,000, of the foundation budget, went to labor. About 90 percent of the crew were immigrants. Without them, [Anderson’s] labor costs could swell to $49,800. The newspaper’s admission of 20 percent pay cuts may be a gross underestimate of the economic damage. In 2018, for example, Blaine Taylor, a U.S. construction worker, told Breitbart News that construction wages in California were roughly $45 an hour in the late 1980s. By 2018 — nearly two decades after illegal aliens began flooding the industry — wages were standing at just $11 an hour, he said. The New York Times article illustrates the widespread recognition in media outlets and banking reports that President Joe Biden’s mass-migration policy cut wages for Americans while President Donald Trump’s deportation policy is raising wages for Americans. “A reduction in labor supply means upward pressure on wages,” Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch on January 23. “The implication of what’s happening with deportations … is that we should expect continued wage growth in 2025” in construction, Matt Saunders, vice president of building products research at John Burns Research and Consulting, said mid-March. “Low-wage migrant workers might depress wage gains for other low-wage workers,” the JP. Morgan investment firm said March 26. For a decade, Breitbart News has tracked these admissions, which were rare until the election of Joe Biden in 2020. The admissions rapidly expanded once business groups began to argue in Biden’s term that low-wage migration could reduce inflation from housing and other sources. That self-serving argument marked a sudden reversal from the prior self-serving insistence that migration had a negligible impact on Americans’ wages. Many left-wing reporters have persuaded themselves to tout the business groups’ new anti-inflation argument for cheap immigrant labor, said Camarota: There’s still the perception that business interests are in the Republican Party, and as such, it’s very tempting for [pro-migrant] reporters to say, “Look, you’re screwing your own people here — Republicans want this immigration!” It lets the reporters who are generally progressives say “We’re concerned about businesses and we’re concerned about the availability of labor they have, and we’re looking out for this big part of your Republican constituents. Why aren’t you listening?” Unfortunately, what it suggests is a lot of reporters [have] a deep concern for the plight of immigrants, not the wages of working class Americans. Camarota’s narrative is illustrated by another New York Times article on March 3. The impact [of deportations] is being felt not only in immigrant homes and communities, but also in the industries that rely on immigrants as a source of willing and inexpensive labor, including residential construction, agriculture, senior care and hospitality. American consumers will soon feel the pain. “Businesses across industries know what comes next when their work force disappears — restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores struggling to stay open, food prices soaring, and everyday Americans demanding action,” said Rebecca Shi, chief executive of the American Business Immigration Coalition. The reporter in the construction article explained how she came up with the estimated wage gains: Mr. Anderson sat down with The New York Times and estimated how his labor costs might change without immigrant workers, based on his personal experience, and using this house as a model. The Times also applied national and regional labor trends to his calculations, and analyzed construction industry work force demographics from census survey data. Given that Trump policies have affected both documented and undocumented immigrants, we did not differentiate between the two groups. The reporters’ narrow focus on claimed labor shortages also hides the impact of migration on productivity numbers or employers’ willingness to fund and train the millions of alienated men who have fallen out of the economy, said Camarato. “Employers can respond to [wage gains] by changing their recruitment practices, but also adopting more productive production, such as [the use of] more pre-fabrication than trying to build everything on site,” he said. “Labor-saving devices and techniques that increase productivity, ultimately, would be very good for [national] growth and prosperity,” he said. The same economic trend is visible in the white-collar sector, where the H-1B program has been used by investors, executives, and Indian hiring managers to divert wages and opportunities away from millions of American college graduates. The inflow of mixed-skill visa workers has also stalled corporate productivity and innovation, so denying massive gains to shareholders and tax collectors. So far, Trump’s deputies have not curtailed the counterproductive H-1B program. But some political and economic leaders argue that labor shortages will boost productivity and innovation. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President J.D. Vance told an audience of investors in mid-March. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. “The key question you have to ask when it comes to immigration is, who do you favor? Owners of capital or workers?” said Camarota. “In general, a larger share of [national income] has been going, over time, to owners of capital. And I think it’s one of the sources of dissatisfaction, indirectly, for the working class,” he said, adding: “Less immigration then is most definitely good for the working class, including the immigrant working class, already.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: Financial technology startup Plaid closes $575M investment at $6B valuation

UPDATED 17:41 EDT / APRIL 03 2025 by Maria Deutscher Plaid Inc., a startup that provides software for connecting financial applications with one another, has raised $575 million in fresh funding. The raise was led by a group of new investors that included Franklin Templeton, Fidelity and BlackRock. Plaid detailed in its announcement of the round today that several returning backers chipped in as well. The company’s outside funding now stands at about $1.3 billion. Plaid is worth $6 billion post-money, less than half the valuation it received following a funding round in 2022. However, the company’s valuation is higher than the $5 billion that Visa Inc. would have paid to buy it in 2020. The acquisition fell through after regulators raised antitrust concerns. Many financial applications require the ability to interact with users’ bank accounts. An expense tracking tool, for example, must retrieve information about recent purchases to measure spending. Other services require the ability to make payments and manage investments. Connecting an application to bank accounts is a highly complicated process. Different banks configure their systems in different ways, which requires developers to learn the nuances of each financial institution’s software. There’s also the matter of complying with financial regulations and fending off cyberattacks. Plaid offers a platform called Link that eases the task. It provides prepackaged integrations with more than 12,000 financial institutions, which removes the need for developers to build everything from scratch. Link can add bank account connections to web, desktop and mobile apps. The company also offers a second version of the platform called Modular Link. It allows developers to more extensively customize the interface through which users connect their bank accounts to an app. A software team could, for example, redesign the interface pane that displays error messages. After connecting to a bank account, financial services can use Plaid’s technology for a range of tasks. The software is capable of retrieving information about the user’s purchases and investments. It’s also possible to make a bank transfer or configure recurring payments for a subscription. Plaid’s platform is used by thousands of customers, including Zillow Group Inc., Flexport Inc. and other major tech firms The software maker says that those companies use its technology to support hundreds of millions of consumers. According to TechCrunch, Plaid’s latest funding round follows a year in which its revenue climbed 24%. The company also moved closer toward profitability by returning to positive operating margins. It will use most of the new capital to provide liquidity for employees. The funding round is expected to be Plaid’s last before it goes public. However, the company reportedly doesn’t plan to list its shares in the foreseeable future.

Among the topics discussed in meetings conducted this week, the SEC heard arguments on in-kind redemptions and staking for crypto ETPs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force held separate meetings on April 1 with representatives from BlackRock and the Crypto Council for Innovation’s (CCI) Proof of Stake Alliance to discuss regulatory issues related to crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). According to memos about the meetings, BlackRock discussed the in-kind redemptions for crypto ETPs traded in the US. At the same time, the CCI included staking on ETPs among the topics discussed with the regulator. BlackRock’s attendees included senior representatives from regulatory affairs, product engineering, ETF capital markets, and federal policy. During its session with the Crypto Task Force, BlackRock presented a document detailing existing workflows and the role of market participants supporting the cash model used in ETPs. The firm also addressed how these systems could apply to potential in-kind models for future crypto-based funds. Separately, the SEC met with members of the Proof of Stake Alliance under the Crypto Council for Innovation. The group, composed of representatives from firms such as a16z, Paradigm, Consensys, Alluvial, Lido Labs Foundation, and Marinade, discussed staking-related topics and their implications for crypto ETPs. The agenda included reviewing various staking models, including liquid, custodial, and delegated non-custodial staking. Participants also presented staking-as-a-service industry principles intended to inform the regulatory treatment of validator operations and user participation in proof-of-stake networks. The discussion also touched on how staking rewards, validator responsibilities, and service provider relationships factor into the risk profile and valuation of potential staking-enabled crypto ETPs. The SEC’s engagement with BlackRock and the Proof of Stake Alliance signals continued institutional interest in advancing regulatory clarity for crypto financial products. The discussions follow an earlier meeting held on Feb. 5, during which the SEC’s Crypto Task Force met with representatives from Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital to evaluate the potential inclusion of staking within crypto ETPs. Participants, including Jito Labs CEO Lucas Bruder and Multicoin Capital managing partner Kyle Samani, argued that staking is essential to proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana. They noted that excluding staking from ETPs could diminish investor returns and compromise the functional utility of PoS assets. Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital representatives proposed two models to address the SEC’s concerns. The “Services Model” allows partial staking through third-party validators while maintaining liquidity for redemptions, while the “Liquid Staking Token Model” enables ETPs to hold liquid staking tokens. While no regulatory outcomes were disclosed, the meetings form part of the SEC’s ongoing review process as it evaluates technical and legal frameworks regarding crypto ETPs.

Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%) fell with other Magnificent 7 stocks on Thursday as the market reacted to new tariffs — but the company also may’ve slipped because a major bank downgraded it for unrelated reasons. The chipmaker’s shares were down 6.6% during pre-market trading on Thursday morning, less than a day after President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs against U.S. trade partners. At the market open Thursday, Nvidia’s shares were down 4.9% — and then fell an additional 1.3% during mid-day trading. The company ended the day down 7.8% at the market close. However, Altimeter Capital chief executive Brad Gerstner told CNBC that he expects Nvidia to fair well amid the Trump administration’s new tariffs. “The growth and the demand for GPUs is off the charts,” Gerstner said during an appearance on “Fast Money Halftime Report.” He added that semiconductors are exempted from the tariffs — a “wise exception” — because of the global AI race. Meanwhile, HSBC (HSBC-6.37%) analyst Frank Lee downgraded his rating for the company’s stock from “buy” to “hold” on Thursday, citing concerns over Nvidia’s ability to continue its strong growth. Lee said Nvidia had previously had strong pricing power due to its dominance of the market for graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are essential to powering generative artificial intelligence models, according to MarketWatch (NWSA-5.04%). However, that pricing power could have less of an impact in the future, as the company hasn’t raised average selling prices. It “is likely to cap earnings upside momentum,” Lee reportedly said in the note. He also noted that Nvidia’s earnings and guidance beats in the last three quarters have been shrinking, due to “increasing market focus on Nvidia’s earnings as well ongoing uncertainty over its Blackwell supply chain ramp-up.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) have tentatively agreed to form a joint venture that would run the U.S. company’s foundry business. TSMC, the world's largest chip manufacturer, will own a 20% stake in the combined company, according to reports citing The Information. TSMC declined to remark on the reports, while Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Intel’s foundry division produces chips for third-party customers. The business has long been the subject of deal speculation, including a report last month that TSMC approached several other chipmakers about a joint venture to operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities. The report of a tentative deal also comes less than a day after President Trump announced a sweeping package of tariffs against goods imported from other countries. Intel shares gained 2% Thursday, while TSMC shares lost close to 8% amid a broad-based decline as worries about the new tariffs rattled markets.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy With more big industrial real estate tenants looking to own the spaces they use, a prominent off-price retailer put down a quarter of a billion dollars for one of its distribution centers in Southern California as its business grows. Burlington, formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, paid more than $257 million to acquire an 889,445-square-foot industrial warehouse from the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock. Burlington has been the sole tenant at the Inland Empire facility since it was completed in 2019. Colliers (CIGI)’ Mark Zorn and Cory Whitman represented Burlington and announced the deal for 21600 Cactus Avenue in Riverside, Calif., while CBRE (CBRE) represented BlackRock. Burlington’s move from tenant to owner comes as it expands its operations. The publicly traded company opened 101 new stores in 2024 and plans to open another 100 locations this year. The deal also demonstrates the demand for and the value of new warehouse development in the nation’s biggest market for logistics and industrial space. “The Inland Empire industrial market continued to see elevated demand in Q4 2024, with leasing activity surpassing 10 million square feet for the third consecutive quarter,” Zorn said in a statement. “Burlington’s commitment to this location is a testament to the Inland Empire’s status as a leading industrial market.” Gregory Cornfield can be reached at gcornfield@commercialobserver.com.

("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Merck investors have until April 14, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. According to the complaint, the defendants provided investors with material information regarding Merck’s projected $11 billion in revenue from Gardasil sales by 2030. Their statements expressed confidence in Merck’s ability to drive demand through consumer activation and education efforts, emphasizing the benefits of Gardasil and targeting eligible populations for vaccination. As a result, they issued optimistic reports and forecasts about Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced that it would no longer meet its long-forecasted $11 billion in Gardasil sales by 2030. The company revealed it would halt shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants attributed this decision to an overinflation of channel inventories, citing that demand in China had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this announcement, Merck’s common stock plummeted. After closing at $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, the stock price dropped to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025—a decline of more than 9% in just one day.

Title: I finally get the Costco hype now that I moved from an apartment to a house. Here are 18 purchases I swear by.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/favorite-things-costco-moved-to-house-california-list-for-two-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-03T20:00:02Z
Full Content:
I grew up in New York City and have always lived in small apartments without much storage space. It just never made sense for me to buy groceries in bulk. However, my partner and I recently moved to Los Angeles, and now we have a whole house to ourselves. One of the best perks of our new life is taking monthly trips to Costco for all our favorite items. Here are my favorite things to get there. We tend to have a Costco shopping trip at least once a month, and I also go there about once a week to fuel my car. Gas is expensive, especially in Los Angeles, and Costco typically has unbeatable prices — particularly for premium, which is what my Mini Cooper takes. The best part is I can easily check the rate on a daily basis when using the store's app, which helps me determine if Costco gas prices are better than competitors that day. My partner is a carnivore to the max. To him, nothing beats the five-pack of the Kirkland Signature boneless New York steaks. They taste great on the grill or in a cast-iron pan and are often the star of a delicious weekday meal for us. We never skip out on buying Costco's ribs, especially since we can get over 9 pounds of meat for about $35. The store also stocks pre-seasoned ribs, which are great when we're out of our homemade dry rub. We'll make these for ourselves or when having friends over for a barbecue. I'm a huge fan of Kirkland Signature products, and I especially like the label's organic Greek yogurt. It's perfect for making smoothies creamy or adding protein to granola. Now that I live in a house, I have room in my freezer to buy staples in bulk, like frozen strawberries. I'm usually pretty happy with the prices of frozen fruit at Costco, so I pick up mixed berries or strawberries there. Recently, I got 4 pounds of Kirkland Signature organic strawberries for $10, which felt like a steal compared to prices I've seen at other local grocery stores. Again, now that I have the space, I'm able to buy more household staples in bulk. We often pick up big packs of the Kirkland Signature paper towels and store them in our shed to optimize kitchen space. These affordable paper towels are thick and powerful. One 12-pack of rolls often lasts us over two months, especially since we supplement the use of them with microfiber cloths. Since we live in a house with a ton of random gadgets, we somehow always need batteries. I try to keep a few varieties on hand. Fortunately, we've found Kirkland Signature batteries to be fairly affordable and easy to buy in bulk. They especially came in handy during the recent California wildfires, when we lost power and needed to use flashlights. Working from home, I get distracted and find myself not hydrating frequently or as much as I should. So, I like that I can use Liquid IV to boost the flavor and hydration power of my water with electrolytes and sugar-free flavoring. I'm usually not able to find sugar-free Liquid IV at my local grocery stores, but Costco always seems to have some packs in stock. My partner and I typically each eat one Kirkland Signature protein bar a day. I don't eat too much meat, so these bars help me easily get 21 grams of protein when I need a boost. We usually buy the variety pack with 10 cookie-dough and 10 brownie bars. My partner likes the cookie-dough flavor, and I prefer the brownie one — a match made in heaven. I'm a huge date girl. Dates really are nature's candy. I love eating them raw on their own, making date bark with some peanut butter and chocolate chips, or incorporating them into a smoothie or yogurt bowl. They're a great source of fiber, potassium, and magnesium too. I love baking, but quality vanilla extract is a key ingredient in many recipes that can be expensive and hard to find in larger quantities. At Costco, however, I can find 16 ounces of pure vanilla extract for under $12. To me, that's an amazing deal. Kirkland Signature honey is one of our pantry staples since I'm a huge tea fan and love adding it to my drinks. I also recently got my partner into peppermint tea, which can be enhanced with a dollop of honey. This honey tastes high-quality — and getting three 24-ounce bottles of it for under $13 feels like a bargain. Yes, I still struggle with acne in my late 20s. I really like the pimple patches from Hero because they can hardly be seen when they're applied correctly. I'll often wear one or two when I'm traveling on a plane, taking a between-Zoom-meeting stroll, or even having virtual calls. The stickers help me avoid picking at my skin, and I'm a firm believer they make my pimples disappear much faster. As someone who deals with allergies, I always try to keep medication on hand that will help me deal with symptoms. Name-brand options can get pricey, especially since I take tablets every day. So, I opt for Kirkland Signature allergy medicine. The $5 bottle of 600 pills does my wallet a huge favor. One of the first things we did when moving into our first place together was buy a first-aid kit. After that, we stocked up on some of our staple medications, like ibuprofen Since moving to Los Angeles, my skin has struggled to adjust to the dry climate. So, I've been buying bulk packs of the CeraVe moisturizing cream and using it morning and night. Hydrating and not greasy, the cream has been my hero as of late. Plus, it's fairly affordable at Costco at $25 for two 16-ounce tubs. Perhaps one of the best things about Costco is that it's truly a one-stop shop. I always check the retailer's clothing section and often pick up a piece or two. My latest favorite purchase is the $18 two-piece lounge set from Honeydew. It's so cozy and especially great on long car or plane rides. Lastly, we end our shopping trip with celebratory Costco hot dogs, which cost just $1.50 each and come with a soft drink.

Title: BlackRock and SEC explore next phase of crypto ETFs in closed-door task force meeting

Time Published: 2025-04-03T19:53:06Z
Full Content:
Share this article BlackRock and the US Securities and Exchange Commission met this week to discuss potential changes to crypto exchange-traded product workflows, including transitioning to in-kind redemptions for digital asset funds. The closed-door meeting, held on Monday, April 1, with the SEC’s newly formed Crypto Task Force, focused on the structure and mechanics of crypto ETFs. BlackRock’s team is understood to have discussed in greater depth the potential for in-kind redemptions, a model the firm has already filed for in its spot Bitcoin ETF. In-kind redemptions allow authorized participants to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying asset, such as Bitcoin, instead of cash, improving efficiency and reducing costs. The meeting signals that such redemptions may be gaining regulatory traction. The conversation comes as BlackRock’s crypto exposure continues to grow, with over 574,000 BTC held in its IBIT fund and more than 1.1 million ETH in its Ether ETF. Senior representatives from BlackRock’s regulatory, product, and ETF teams participated in discussions on adapting existing ETP workflows to support in-kind systems. Since approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, the SEC has mandated cash-only redemption models, citing custody and compliance risks. Nasdaq’s filing for BlackRock’s in-kind redemption model states that such a structure would align crypto ETFs more closely with traditional commodity-based ETFs.

Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired AppLovin securities during the Class Period may, no later than MAY 5, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Headquartered in Palo Alto, Calif., AppLovin is a developer of a software-based platform for advertisers. According to the complaint, AppLovin and senior management misled investors regarding AppLovin’s financial growth and stability, raising expectations as to the launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and the use of “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analysts Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research each published reports accusing AppLovin of, among other things, reverse-engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged that AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, thus presenting false installation numbers and profits. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025 – a decline of $46.06 per share, or 12%.

The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case.

Title: Not a Meme! DePIN Can Take Crypto Mainstream
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/04/03/not-a-meme-depin-can-take-crypto-mainstream
Time Published: 2025-04-03T19:38:26Z

For years, the crypto market has thrived on speculation, where excitement, hype and fleeting trends attract value instead of fundamentals. Investors have continually poured money into tokens fueled by viral moments, chasing rapid gains. Time and again, a select few of these investments soar to incredible heights, only to come crashing down. With over 33 million tokens in circulation, the competition to attract attention gets harder and harder and investor attention is ever more fleeting. But DePIN can change this. With compelling businesses attracting real customers and revenue built on well designed token economics, DePIN can set a new standard of fundamentals in crypto. As our DePIN Token Economics Report outlines, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) offer a number of compelling businesses with fundamental value. Unlike typical crypto projects driven by speculation, DePIN offers a different approach. It uses blockchain technology to support real-world infrastructure, creating tangible value and generating real revenue. Instead of relying on hype, it builds a financial system based on actual demand, making it a more sustainable and practical model. Rather than resembling major crypto networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, DePIN operates more like capital-light marketplaces such as Uber and Airbnb, but with key distinctions. While both models connect providers with customers without funding infrastructure, DePIN providers are compensated in tokens that can appreciate in value, akin to Uber drivers or Airbnb hosts receiving equity. Additionally, most DePINs sell to businesses which eliminates the need for massive marketing expenses required in building a consumer brand. DePIN offers a compelling business model and, unlike memes that come and go, it is the beginning of crypto’s transformation into a mature, revenue-generating industry. At its core, DePIN represents a paradigm shift. Traditionally, blockchain-based businesses have relied on hype to attract buyers. In the absence of traditional fundamentals, the industry cycled through endless metrics such as TPS, TVL, Telegram channel size, followers on X and many others. Many projects have attempted to build decentralized ecosystems. But, without real customers paying for services, they have largely functioned as economies fueled by speculation rather than external demand. DePIN changes this by integrating blockchain technology with physical and digital infrastructure, creating compelling services that generate revenue. Whether it is decentralized cloud computing, wireless networks, mapping or storage solutions, DePIN projects offer services like traditional businesses and with customers who pay for usage. When combined with the correct token economics, it creates a sustainable financial model. As DePIN generates growing revenue, it is likely to draw institutional investors who have long been skeptical of crypto’s reliance on hype and speculation. The projects that successfully correlate the token demand to actual business growth will not only survive the current market but also set the standard for the next generation of blockchain companies The report also highlights one of the most compelling aspects of DePIN, the use of buy-and-burn, which removes the need to have an expanding pool of new buyers. Instead, these projects use a portion of their revenue to repurchase and burn tokens, permanently reducing supply and potentially driving long-term price appreciation similar to stock buybacks. This approach is in stark contrast to most of crypto which relies on new buyers to sustain and grow their value.The buy-and-burn model ensures that as DePIN businesses grow and generate more revenue, their token ecosystems become more resilient to market fluctuations. Some DePIN tokens are already demonstrating this by decoupling from broader crypto market trends, proving that real-world adoption can lead to price stability and long-term investor confidence. While DePIN offers significant potential, it also comes with challenges. One major concern is transparency, as most projects lack traditional financial reports, audits, or clear revenue statements. However, blockchain itself provides a solution — on-chain verification through buy-and-burn mechanisms allows for real-time financial tracking, giving investors a clearer picture of a project’s health. Another challenge is customer adoption. Many businesses and consumers remain concerned due to crypto’s volatility. To address this, DePIN projects are introducing fiat payment options and stablecoin rewards, making it easier for everyday users to interact with these decentralized services without needing prior crypto or Web3 experience. For DePIN to succeed, its incentive structures must be designed to keep all stakeholders — providers, users, and investors aligned. One way to achieve alignment is through staking mechanisms, especially in cloud-based networks where service providers lock up tokens as collateral to guarantee reliability. Projects like Filecoin and Fluence already use this approach, ensuring accountability while strengthening network security. Others, such as Render and Livepeer, take a different route by distributing a share of network revenue to token stakers, creating a system similar to dividends that rewards long-term commitment. Governance will also be critical as DePIN projects decentralize. To prevent large token holders from short-term profiteering for quick gains, new governance models like quadratic voting and weighted staking are emerging. These frameworks help keep decision-making balanced, ensuring that projects remain sustainable and fair as they evolve. DePIN isn’t just another blockchain investment vehicle, it is laying the foundation for real, decentralized infrastructure. While meme coins have shown that crypto can generate hype, they rarely create lasting value. In contrast, DePIN is developing businesses that can compete with centralized companies by focusing on real-world utility. With token models backed by revenue, deflationary supply mechanics, and increasing interest from institutional investors, DePIN is redefining how blockchain networks should function. The projects that successfully address capital efficiency, align incentives, and navigate regulatory challenges will be the ones that lead this next phase of decentralized technology. As DePIN matures, its token models will continue to evolve. Optimizing capital efficiency through transparent buy-and-burn rates will ensure liquidity while maintaining long-term value. Governance structures will adapt to prevent short-term actors from derailing network growth. By 2026, DePIN will be recognized as the benchmark for sustainable blockchain economies, proving that crypto can function as more than a speculative asset class. The crypto industry stands at a crossroads. Investors, developers, and institutions must choose between supporting unsustainable token models or supporting projects that create real value. For the space to mature, it needs to move beyond pure speculation, and DePIN is at the forefront of that transformation.

Shares of Lyft (LYFT) dropped Thursday as Bank of America analysts gave the ride-hailing company the dreaded double downgrade. Lyft stock was recently down about 11% to roughly $11.50, leaving them down nearly 40% over the past 12 months. The analysts dropped their rating on the company's shares to "underperform" from "buy" and cut their price target to $10.50 from $17.50, which was a bit above the Street's consensus, according to Visible Alpha data. While most of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have neutral ratings on Lyft's shares, the mean target above $16 reflects some optimism, making Bank of America's change stand out. The bank's analysts cited concerns about Lyft's positioning in autonomous vehicles and "pricing headwinds" even as they cited a solid and growing user base as strengths. "We still see long-term potential for Lyft in [the] AV ecosystem, but given its still-nascent partnerships, we are losing confidence in near-term upside," they wrote. Lyft reported mixed fourth-quarter results in mid-February. Shares of Lyft fell as markets were under pressure due to trade-policy concerns. Uber (UBER), a key peer, saw its stock lose nearly 6%.

Title: The 10 Biggest Billionaire Losers Of The Tariff War So Far

ByGiacomo Tognini ByGiacomo Tognini, Forbes Staff. Mark Zuckerberg (left), Jeff Bezos (center) and Elon Musk (right) at Donald Trump's inauguration in January, alongside Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Bezos' fiancée Lauren Sánchez. Editor's note: This article was updated after the stock market close at 4 pm Eastern time on April 3, 2025. P resident Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the U.S. would impose a flat 10% tariff on every country in the world, with higher rates for many of America’s largest trading partners including China, India, Japan, South Korea, the U.K. and the European Union. The news sent stock markets tumbling around the world on Thursday, with the S&P 500 index down 5% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite down 6%. Stock markets in Japan, Hong Kong and Europe also suffered losses. That rout wiped a collective $270 billion from the fortunes of the world’s 3,000 billionaires. The biggest losers so far are the very richest people in the world, particularly those who have cozied up to Trump in recent times. No one has been hit harder than Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose fortune is down by $17.9 billion since yesterday’s stock market close, as shares of the Facebook parent plummeted by 9%. Zuckerberg, who sat next to Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk at Trump’s inauguration in January after Meta donated to Trump’s inaugural committee, has also met with the president at the White House several times since then—most recently on Wednesday. The second-biggest loser so far? Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who has recently tried to grow closer to Trump, sitting in the second row behind the president at his inauguration in January after Amazon donated to Trump’s inaugural committee. In February, he announced the Washington Post—which he bought for $250 million in 2013—would change its opinion pages to focus on supporting personal liberties and free markets. A month later, he opined on tariffs, saying in an X post that the opinion pages would cover "the damaging and distorting effects if tariffs are used to pick winners and losers." With Amazon shares down 9%, Bezos is $16 billion poorer on Thursday. Larry Ellison, the founder of software giant Oracle, is down $9.9 billion, thanks to a 6% drop in Oracle stock. (He’s also a major shareholder in Tesla.) Unlike Bezos and Zuckerberg, Ellison has long been a major donor to Republicans, and he hosted a fundraiser for Trump in 2020 and dined with him at his Palm Beach club Mar-A-Lago last year. In January, he joined the president to announce a planned $500 billion investment in AI data centers in the U.S. alongside OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and Trump’s right-hand-man at the Department of Government Efficiency, is taking a beating, too. He has lost $8.7 billion, the fifth-most in dollar terms among billionaires, with Tesla shares slumping by more than 5% after a rough week in which the automaker announced its sales dropped by 13% in the first three months of the year. Meanwhile, French luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault, who was the world’s richest person until last year, suffered an $8.6 billion loss as shares in his conglomerate LVMH dipped by nearly 6%. Arnault made a public display of support for Trump in January, attending his inauguration alongside two of his five children, who are all executives at LVMH. Besides Bezos and Zuckerberg, many other tech barons—including Michael Dell, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin—also saw steep losses. At least five billionaires have fallen out of the ranks entirely today. The biggest loser in percentage terms has been RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) CEO Gary Friedman, whose net worth has fallen by 37%, to about $730 million. Shares in the upscale furniture firm have plunged by 40%, wiping $435 million from Friedman’s fortune. Other dropoffs made their fortunes in the clothing industry, which could also be hard-hit by tariffs: The U.S. is the largest importer of apparel in the world, sourcing most apparel from Asia, including 21% from China and 18% from Vietnam. It’s no surprise then that husband-and-wife duo Kenneth and Yvonne Lo, the Hong Kong-based cofounders of clothing manufacturer Crystal International Group, also have fallen below the $1 billion mark as shares in the Hong Kong-based firm tumbled by 23%. Crystal, which makes clothes for companies including Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Nike, Adidas and Puma, relied on North America for 38% of its revenues in 2024. Brian Hill, the founder of Vancouver-based women's fashion retailer Aritzia, also saw his net worth fall below $1 billion as the firm's stock cratered by 20%. And how is Trump faring amid the market upheaval? Not so bad. The president’s net worth is down by $40 million, to $4.6 billion, as shareholders pushed the price of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the parent company of his social media outfit Truth Social, down 3%, less than overall market’s decline. Here are the 10 biggest billionaire losers as of the market close:

Title: BlackRock’s BUIDL fund pays $4.17M dividends in March, surpasses $25M in total payout

The dividends paid in March are nearly double the previous all-time high of $2.1 million, registered in July 2024. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) distributed $4.17 million in dividends during March, marking the largest monthly payout for a tokenized Treasury fund. According to a report by BUIDL’s issuer, Securitize, the record-setting distribution brings BUIDL’s cumulative dividend payments to $25.4 million since its inception, reflecting increasing institutional interest in on-chain exposure to traditional financial products. Additionally, Securitize noted that the March record is roughly 2x larger than the previous $2.1 million peak registered in July 2024. The fund, which tokenizes a money market strategy comprised of US Treasuries and cash equivalents, provides daily dividend payouts Monday through Friday, giving investors near real-time yield accruals directly on-chain. Tokenized US Treasury funds are emerging as a foundational layer in on-chain finance. By providing verifiable, yield-bearing backing, they offer alternatives to crypto-native stablecoins. The sector is the second-largest in tokenization, with nearly $5 billion in size. BUIDL’s assets under management (AUM) reached an all-time high of $1.93 billion on March 27, less than a month after crossing the $1 billion threshold. According to data from rwa.xyz, its rapid growth places it among the largest real-world asset (RWA) products on public blockchains, trailing only four stablecoins in market capitalization. A key driver of BUIDL’s AUM expansion is Ethena Labs’ synthetic dollar, USDtb, which uses the fund for 90% of its backing. As of the latest figures shared by Ethena Labs, USDtb has $1.29 billion in exposure to BUIDL, accounting for 67% of the fund’s total market value. USDtb, designed to maintain price stability through a delta-neutral strategy, allocates reserve capital into BUIDL to earn yield from US Treasury exposure. This structure has made BUIDL a critical component in Ethena’s stablecoin design, directly linking traditional fixed-income instruments to crypto-native applications. Notably, MakerDAO’s Spark will hold a vote on April 3 to decide whether the protocol should follow its plan to invest $500 million in BUIDL. This would boost the fund’s market size even further, making participation in investments by DeFi protocols represent 74% of current numbers. BUIDL has been expanding its offering to various blockchains. After its launch on Ethereum, the fund expanded to Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, Aptos, and Solana more recently. This multi-chain deployment is part of Securitize’s strategy to make institutional-grade financial products natively accessible across decentralized environments, facilitating integrations with protocols and wallets across ecosystems. Yet, $1.72 billion of BUIDL shares are issued on Ethereum’s blockchain, nearly 90% of the fund’s size.

April 03, 2025 14:22 ET | Source: DiCello Levitt LLP DiCello Levitt LLP SAN DIEGO, April 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025 (the “Class Period”), charging the Company and certain senior executives with violations of the federal securities laws (collectively, “Defendants”). Rocket Lab investors have until April 28, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit. If you purchased or acquired Rocket Lab securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, and suffered substantial losses, and you wish to obtain additional information or serve as lead plaintiff in this lawsuit, you may submit your information and contact us here: https://dicellolevitt.com/securities/rocket-lab/. You can also contact DiCello Levitt attorneys Brian O’Mara or Ruben Peña by calling (888) 287-9005 or emailing investors@dicellolevitt.com. Those who inquire by email are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. Case Allegations Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company that designs and manufactures small and medium-class rockets, spacecraft, and spacecraft components, including related software and services. In March 2021, the Company announced plans to develop Neutron, a reusable-ready medium-capacity launch vehicle to increase the payload capacity of its space launch vehicle. In early 2024, Rocket Lab announced it would conduct a test launch of Neutron in mid-2025, followed by three commercial launches in 2026 and five in 2027. The Rocket Lab lawsuit alleges that Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) the preparation of the launch pad was delayed by a critical potable water issue that was not going to be fixed until January 2026; (3) as a result, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner. The truth emerged on February 25, 2025, when Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time” (the “Report”). In relevant part, the Report stated that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025, a timeline the company has repeatedly claimed in media interviews and on earnings calls.” The Report, citing documents and interviews with industry experts, further claimed that “[m]any aspects of RKLB’s Neutron program remain far behind where they need to be: from engine development, to engine and structure production, to launch pad construction, to rocket transport to the launch site.” On this news, the price of Rocket Lab’s stock fell by $2.21 per share, or approximately 10%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025.

April 03, 2025 14:15 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Trump's Tariffs Are a Bruising Defeat for the AI Industry
URL: https://futurism.com/trump-tariffs-ai-industry-mag7
Time Published: 2025-04-03T17:29:13Z
Full Content:
If you follow tech stocks, there's probably one thing on your mind today: Donald Trump's tariffs. Yesterday, Trump announced his long-teased "reciprocal tariffs" on foreign imports coming into the US. Among them are a 32 percent tariff on Taiwan, 24 percent on Japan, 26 percent on India, and 34 percent on China — all major players in the global tech trade. As a result, the magnificent seven (M7) stocks — a stock trader term for the current whales of the tech industry: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — are in a freefall today, as investors sell off their shares to brace for economic uncertainty. Among the tech industry, the stagnant AI sector is being hit particularly hard, as energy costs are anticipated to skyrocket along with the cost of important resources like steel, precious minerals, and semiconductors. As such, the cost to build and run data centers, the massive facilities that make AI computing possible, is expected to spike as the supply chain adjusts to the new normal. The vast majority of chips that power these data centers come from hard-hit countries like Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, and Vietnam, while the US makes just 11 percent of its chips at home. Trump's tariffs will force countries from those companies to hike their chip prices, and US companies will no doubt hike their prices to compensate, which will ultimately run off to consumers. That's a crushing blow for American AI companies, which were already facing the consequences of investor skepticism, lagging revenue, and a disappointing debut AI IPO by CoreWeave. Broader details about how these tariffs will affect the tech industry are foggy right now, as the stock market is moving at a breakneck pace, but there is one common theme: everything is down. Apple, for example, is heading for its biggest single-day plunge in stock price in nearly 5 years, dropping over 8 percent in just the first few hours of trading. Other M7 stocks are likewise plummeting, with Amazon down almost 9 percent, and Nvidia down by 6.7 at the time of writing. Tesla has continued its months-long cascade with a 7 percent dip so far. If you're wondering why we're doing this, you're not alone. For decades, the United States has sat atop the global economic food chain. Thanks to years of military and economic supremacy, the US dollar became the world standard, making it easy to export cheap consumer goods as high-paying American jobs became starvation industries in countries dependent on US trade. Trump's tariffs seem to be an attempt to reverse all that — an economic experiment that's never really been attempted at this scale. The entire move hinges on the bet that companies will shift production from places like Vietnam and Taiwan back into the US, a gamble which business leaders say comes with high costs and even higher risks. As Trump's tariffs aren't enshrined in law, they could be easily undone by the courts or the next presidential administration, making a long-term investment into, say, a $5 billion semiconductor plant on US soil hard to justify from a business standpoint — and at the end of the day, isn't what this is all about?

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices.

Title: BlackRock chief sees risk of brief recession in US amid Trump tariffs

Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said the US faces the risk of tipping into a brief recession in the coming months, after its president, Donald Trump, unleashed a range of tariffs on the world this week. However, he said in an interview with The Irish Times in Dublin on Thursday that the new administration’s policy of cutting government costs and red tape would boost growth over the longer term. The possibility of a downturn in the US is “not insignificant” in the next few months, said Mr Fink, who has led the growth of BlackRock into an institution with $11.6 trillion (€10.5 trillion) of assets under management since he co-founded it in 1988. “At the same time, as the president’s policies kick in in relation to deregulation and streamlining permitting [for various projects], we could see a real growth agenda that offsets some of the recessionary short-term pressures,” he added. The US president outlined on Wednesday a raft of tariffs being phased in over the next week, including a baseline charge of 10 per cent on imports, rising to 20 per cent for the EU, 30 per cent on China and 46 per cent on Vietnam. Stock market indices across Asia, Europe and Wall Street fell on Thursday – wiping $1.7 trillion off the value of companies listed on the S&P 500 index by midday in the US alone – as investors digested the sweeping tariff announcements and potential for retaliation. Gold, seen as a safe haven in times of turbulence, reached a fresh record of almost $3,168 an ounce. US government bond yields – or market interest rates – also fell as investors bet the US Federal Reserve will accelerate interest rate cuts this year to prop up the economy. Yields on European government bonds also dipped. Mr Fink said a US trade war with Europe and other trading partners does not need to follow, as Mr Trump is merely seeking to reciprocate part of what other countries are imposing on imports from the US. He added that Europe must work now to become more competitive. “There does not need to be a true trade war,” he said. “The question is: is there any validity to what the US is doing and saying? Should we have more symmetry in our trading agreements? That’s all. That’s what the reasoning is.” When asked if he agreed with Mr Trump’s approach, he answered: “It’s not for me to agree. But I understand the logic behind it.” Mr Trump said that the new tariffs were “approximately half” of what its trading partners “have been charging us”. That halved figure includes “the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating,” he added. Ireland’s pharmaceutical sector which accounts for 60 per cent of exports from the State to the US, has so far avoided the new EU duty. However, Tánaiste Simon Harris said in the Dáil on Thursday that “we shouldn’t fool ourselves that there aren’t further plans in relation to sector specific measures, including pharma”. The EU is “preparing for further countermeasures” to protect its interest, but focused, for now, on trying to negotiate with the Trump administration, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said Ireland said: “It is important that our response is considered and measured. Any action should be proportionate, aimed at defending the interests of our businesses, workers and citizens.” “A confrontation is in no one’s interests,” he added.

Title: Could Panama Throw a New Wrench Into BlackRock’s Ports Deal?

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Photo: Matt Ragen/Shutterstock April 3 (Reuters) – BlackRock could hit another roadblock in its attempt to secure control of two flagship ports near the Panama Canal once the Central American country releases an audit on a 25-year concession granted to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. Final signature of the deal in Panama, part of a broader $22.8 billion transaction between a BlackRock-led group and CK Hutchison including over 40 ports in 23 countries, is expected to be delayed as criticism grows in China, sources told Reuters last week. The deal’s definitive documentation was initially expected to be signed by April 2, BlackRock and CK Hutchison said last month when they announced the deal. As China’s market regulator begins an antitrust review on the deal, Panama’s government is requesting documents from CK Hutchison, a telecoms-to-retail conglomerate owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing, to complete an audit on the concession. Panama’s Maritime Authority also asked BlackRock and CK Hutchison to provide details of their deal, which must ultimately be green-lit by Panama. The deal includes 90% of the Panama Ports Company, which operates the Balboa and Cristobal ports at either end of the Panama Canal. The Panama ports audit was announced in January by the Comptroller General office as “the most important” of a series of reviews of key infrastructure concessions in Panama. Comptroller general Anel Flores said last week that results are expected in the coming ‘days or weeks.’ Flores has criticized previous audits, including one completed before CK Hutchison’s concession was renewed in 2021, saying they were limited to confirming the fulfillment of operational goals. “We’ll begin a severe, strong audit of those books and company,” he said earlier this year. Flores has also complained about the ‘poor yield’ of the contract for Panama and the slow delivery of documents requested from CK Hutchison. In February, Panama’s Attorney General released a binding opinion finding that the port contract was unconstitutional. Panama’s Supreme Court will have the last word on that. If the Comptroller General finds irregularities in the concession renewal or the Supreme Court declares the contract to be unconstitutional, the concession could be revoked, complicating the BlackRock-CK Hutchison deal and possibly creating grounds for international arbitration, lawyers and experts have said. U.S. President Donald Trump has celebrated the BlackRock-CK Hutchison deal, while China and pro-Beijing voices have criticized it, thrusting the firms involved and the Panamanian ports into the fray of the U.S.-China trade war. However, any hurdles to the deal increase the risk of a hardening of Trump’s policy towards the canal. Since taking office in January, Trump has escalated his threats of controlling places he says could better serve U.S. interests, like the Panama Canal and Greenland. The ports are not part of the canal. However, American officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison’s control of them, along with other concessions to Chinese firms in Panama, represents a security risk for the canal’s operation. CK Hutchison has said the sale of the ports was purely commercial and unrelated to politics. Panama says the canal is operating in a fair and secure way, granting equal access to vessels from all origins. Pro-Beijing media have published a series of commentaries criticizing CK Hutchison’s deal, depicting it as a betrayal of China and a “perfect cooperation” with the U.S. strategy to contain China. The pressure on CK Hutchison has deepened concerns that Hong Kong’s edge as a financial hub will erode further amid geopolitical tensions. The purchase is in line with BlackRock’s recent investment drive in infrastructure, and it secures the fund manager a strong position near an essential global trade hub. The broader deal including many other ports worldwide could give BlackRock control of 10.4% of global container throughput, making it the world’s third largest port operator, Chinese state media reported. The deal has also been described as helping BlackRock and CEO Larry Fink win political capital with Republicans, who in some states have restricted or banned BlackRock from managing retirement or treasury funds over the company’s policies on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investing. Some Republicans were reconsidering BlackRock bans after Trump praised the deal.

Title: Trump Delusionally Brags About Tariffs as Stock Market Crashes

Time Published: 2025-04-03T16:01:35Z

In the topsy-turvy world of the Trump administration, market panic and financial suffering are somehow good things. The president unveiled his economic agenda on Wednesday, revealing steep tariff hikes on practically every country in the world—regardless of whether the U.S. is running a trade deficit or surplus there. The news sent markets reeling. But by Thursday morning, Donald Trump was still celebrating his plan. “THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” But it’s unclear what metrics—if any—Trump used to measure his success. In reality, American businesses were seriously disturbed. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 1,500 points, about 3.5 percent, while the S&P 500 sank by 3.9 percent, setting both on pace for their worst day since the 2022 inflation crisis. The Nasdaq Composite tanked by more than 5 percent—bringing it down by 17 percent from its all-time high and down 13 percent year-to-date, the index’s worst performance since March 2020. Stock futures similarly plummeted. The value of the U.S. dollar dropped, and the price for a troy ounce of gold skyrocketed. Overnight, some of the country’s most competitive companies lost hundreds of billions of dollars. Nike and Lululemon, whose business models rely on international manufacturing deals in China and Vietnam, each lost more than 10 percent. Big-box stores also saw prominent losses: Best Buy, Target, and Home Depot lost 5 percent. The tech industry was similarly shaken: Apple was down 9 percent (worth approximately $300 billion in market value), Alphabet by 4 percent, Amazon by 7 percent, Meta by 7 percent, Microsoft by 3 percent, and Nvidia by 6 percent. Stores that rely heavily on imported goods saw their stocks tank too. Five Below lost 29 percent, Dollar Tree fell by 8 percent, and the Gap suffered a 22 percent loss. “The macro does not make sense, but the level of chaos and uncertainty, coupled with revaluing highly overpriced stocks, is hitting hard,” assessed CNBC analyst Ron Insana on Thursday. In a note to investors, JP Morgan said that Trump’s tariffs had a 40 percent chance of slingshotting the U.S. economy into a recession. JP Morgan underscored that the tariffs would cause a price surge—adding 2 percent to the consumer price index—and additionally raise taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year, “the largest tax increase in recent memory by a long shot,” reported CNN. “The impact on inflation will be substantial,” the analysts said, according to CNN. “We view the full implementation of these policies as a substantial macroeconomic shock.” A judge has ordered the Trump administration to release a man whom it wrongly detained and planned to deport to El Salvador. In a brief one-page filing overnight Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Rolando Olvera ordered that the government not only release Adrian Gil Rojas but that it buy him a ticket from Brownsville, Texas, back to New York. “The Court holds that the Petitioner is a Venezuelan national with a valid Temporary Protected Status and was wrongfully detained,” Olvera wrote. “The Court further holds that Respondents produced no evidence that Petitioner is a danger to the public,” he added. The government had argued that it should be allowed to detain and deport Gil Rojas because his TPS was set to expire on April 2, but his lawyer insisted that he was in the process of reopening his immigration case and that there was reason to believe that the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal TPS would fail. The lawyer was right: On Monday, a San Francisco judge blocked the government from revoking the protected status of about 350,000 Venezuelans. Judge Edward Chen slammed Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem for making “sweeping negative generalizations about Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries.” “Acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism,” Chen said in his order. Gil Rojas, who said that he was arrested in New York last month, had been one of dozens of Venezuelan nationals detained by ICE who were sneakily moved closer and closer to an airfield in Harlingen, Texas, where the government staged a mass deportation to a notorious torture prison in El Salvador. On March 14, the plane that was supposed to take Gil Rojas suffered a mechanical issue and was rescheduled for the following day, giving his lawyer enough time to get Olvera to issue an order blocking his immediate removal. Gil Rojas was spared, unlike the dozens of others for whom due process was suspended under Donald Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law he has reappropriated to aid in his mass deportation efforts. Olvera said that when Gil Rojas was returned to New York, he should be released on his own recognizance, and recommended that he wear an ankle monitor while his immigration case was pending. Earlier this week, the Trump administration admitted that it had wrongly deported Kilmer Armado Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who had been granted protected status from being sent back to El Salvador. The government blamed an “administrative error,” and a judge ruled that the man could not be returned to the U.S. because the court lacked jurisdiction now that he was out of U.S. custody. Evidence that the government expedited the deportation of individuals who, as Olvera put it, were not a “danger to the public” only continues to mount. The government revealed that it had heavily relied on the tattoos to identify members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang the U.S. government has deemed a terrorist group, for deportation. But experts on the gang say that there are no tattoos that signify TdA affiliation. When Democrats attacked the Trump administration for the gargantuan price of eggs, the administration responded by importing vast quantities from Turkey and South Korea—two countries that were hit hard by the tariffs imposed on Wednesday. When asked about the issue, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had no definitive answer on whether those imported eggs would be tariffed, reinforcing the multiple contradictions at the center of Trump’s isolationist trade war in the process. “President Trump yesterday gave you much praise talking about the job you’ve done in the last month and a half. I wanna talk about what you’ve done with eggs,” Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo asked Rollins on Thursday. “National egg prices have declined 9 percent from last week, now averaging $3 a dozen, according to the USDA. Secretary … are eggs gonna be tariffed?” “Well, so, yeah let’s pivot to eggs.… Listen, we rolled out a very bold plan about a month ago.… Obviously it’s his vision we’re effectuating. The market reacted very favorably to it, [it] included some short-term imports but also included helping our poultry farmers in America,” Rollins answered, avoiding the question. “So as we repopulate our chicken farms and our egg-laying farms, I think we’ll see the price coming down even more.… Only good news on the egg front, and hopefully it will hold.” "Yes, I mean, all to be determined, we're all in negotiations, but yes, that's a possibility" -- Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins can't definitively answer a question about whether imported eggs are being tariffed pic.twitter.com/DeQf55p14J “So where are the eggs coming from that you’re importing?” Bartiromo asked. “Well, we’re importing from Turkey, we’re importing from South Korea, to a few other countries right now,” Rollins responded. “But again, at the end of the day. once our farms are repopulated … then we’ll go back to pretty much using all American-lain eggs.” “So then that means that eggs will be tariffed, if you’re taking them from Turkey, right? That’s part of the tariff plan,” Bartiromo pushed. There will be a 10 percent tariff on Turkey, according to Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement. “Well, yes, all to be determined,” Rollins replied, refusing to commit. ‘We’re all at negotiations, but yes, that’s a possibility.” Lower grocery prices—and lower prices in general—were a central theme of Trump’s campaign. Trump himself riffed on it at his “Liberation Day” announcement. But the new tariffs go directly against those promises, and even his inner circle are struggling to find a way to explain themselves. Got a problem with the Trump administration? Good luck. Recently laid-off employees from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were told to contact Anita Pinder, the former director at the agency’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights, with any complaints. A notice informed severed workers that they had 45 calendar days to contact Pinder following their termination date, listing Pinder’s name, email, and phone number. But those who knew Pinder said the directive came as a “gut punch,” according to The Washington Post, since Pinder died last year. “They couldn’t have run it past the people at CMS that were at the funeral and knew she died,” Karen Shields, one of Pinder’s former co-workers, told the Post. “This is a lack of communication. There is just a better way to do this.” Shields told the newspaper that it “pained” her to see Pinder’s name used in the reduction-in-force notices. “She would have been someone, even though her job would have been on the chopping block, she would have helped,” Shields said. The negligent error is just one recent instance in which the “shock and awe” of the Trump administration’s federal makeover has resulted in dud details and mass confusion. At the Food and Drug Administration, fired staffers were instructed to contact an Office of Equal Employment Opportunity employee that had left the agency more than a month ago, the Post reported. So far, the Trump administration—directed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency—has fired more than 100,000 federal employees. But tens of thousands more government jobs are expected to be on the chopping block as Trump pursues a second round of “voluntary” buyouts. More than 10,000 jobs are expected to be cut at the Department of Health and Human Services, which encompasses the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed downsizing the agency’s 82,000-person workforce by nearly a quarter. A new Gallup poll shows that Americans are much more worried about Social Security and the economy. The poll, which measured opinions from March 3 to March 16, said that concern about the Social Security system is at a 15-year high, with 52 percent of Americans worried about it a “great deal.” Also ranking high were the economy at 60 percent, health care costs at 59 percent, and inflation at 56 percent. The worries reflect the Trump administration’s actions over the past few months, with cuts made to the Social Security Administration and the whiplash over the president’s bizarre tariff decisions. Those fears may get worse, as Trump went ahead with instituting aggressive tariffs against countries across the world on Wednesday, calling it “Liberation Day.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk, who is overseeing much of the administration’s policy, has called Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.” Markets have already plummeted Thursday, and criticism of the tariffs have even come within the Republican Party. Cuts to the Social Security Administration threaten to cause interruptions to benefits for 73 million retired workers, their survivors, and poor and disabled Americans. Last month, Martin O’Malley, who headed the SSA under President Biden, warned that the cuts could result in the agency missing payments for the first time in its 80-year history. It’s no surprise that the last time worries about Social Security were this high, the country was in the midst of a recession brought about by the financial crisis of 2008. The difference between now and then is that these worries are brought about by self-inflicted crises. Neither the SSA or the economy were in trouble prior to Trump’s inauguration. If the president continues on its current course, these worries could evolve into full-blown panic over losing Social Security and an even worse recession. The Trump administration is urging nervous voters to “trust” it in response to the impending economic fallout from the President’s tariffs on virtually all foreign imports. “To anyone on Wall Street this morning I would say trust in President Trump,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on CNN Thursday morning. “This is a president who is doubling down on his proven economic formula from his first time. We saw a wages increase, we saw inflation come down. We had a Trump energy boom, we had the largest tax cuts in history, and that’s exactly what the president intends to do.… The United States of America is no longer going to be cheated by foreign nations around the world.” The trade war that the president announced on Wednesday as “Liberation Day” has already tanked the stock market. The country is lurching into a recession, and there is little indication that things will improve anytime soon. Indeed, the tariffs announced on Wednesday are little more than a spiteful policy intended to stick it to friend and foe alike, ostensibly for the purpose of reinvigorating American manufacturing. This is virtually impossible, as these aggressive reciprocal tariffs will most certainly drive up prices for manufacturers and consumers across the country. But the administration would rather have you believe that the economic impact won’t be that bad, or even noticeable. “What can you tell the American people that—they just can’t afford an extra $3 here and there—about the government making up the difference from them?” Lawrence Jones asked Vice President JD Vance on Thursday morning. “Will costs go up at some point, will this just be temporary? Are we talkin’ three months or six months?” “We know a lot of Americans are worried. So we are working very hard to bring prices down,” Vance said. “What I ask folks to appreciate here is that we are not gonna fix things overnight.… We know people are struggling, we’re fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us. But it’s not gonna happen immediately. But we really do believe that if we pursue the right deregulation, we pursue those energy cost-reducing policies, yes people are gonna see it in their pocketbook, they’re also gonna benefit from the fact that foreign countries can’t take advantage of us anymore, that means their jobs are gonna be more secure.” Neither Vance nor Leavitt actually explain how actions like hitting China with a 34 percent tariff will bring prices down for the everyday American, or how this country will be a self-sufficient producer in just a few years. This backtracking and gaslighting is a far cry from Trump’s promise to “immediately bring prices down, starting on day one.” In the scores of countries hit by Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs announced Wednesday, one was mysteriously—but not surprisingly—absent: Russia. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Axios Wednesday that Moscow had been spared from Trump’s tariffs because U.S. sanctions already “preclude any meaningful trade.” Similarly, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that it wasn’t necessary to place tariffs on Russia because after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, trade between the U.S. and Russia had effectively dried up. But the claim that the U.S. doesn’t trade with Russia isn’t remotely true. In 2024, the U.S. imported $3 billion worth of goods from Russia, which was down from $4.6 billion the year before. While this number may be small in comparison to key trading partners such as Canada, which imported a whopping $412.7 billion worth of American goods in 2024, it is still significantly more trade than with other countries that Trump levied steep tariffs against. For example, Saint Pierre et Miquelon, a small French island territory off the coast of Canada, was hit with a whopping 50 percent tariff on imports to the U.S. The island, which has a population of roughly 5,000 people, imported only $100,000 worth of U.S. goods in 2024 and exported roughly $3.4 million worth of goods back. If that’s not low enough, Trump even listed several uninhabited islands as receiving a 10 percent tariff on imports to the United States: Heard Island and the McDonald Islands, an Australian territory that is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its “complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.” Clearly, a lack of trade was not an actual consideration in the Trump administration’s decision to levy tariffs, though Leavitt claimed that existing sanctions were also why Cuba, Belarus, and North Korea were not included on the list. With Leavitt’s excuse falling flat, it seems increasingly likely that Trump has attempted to carve out a back door for Russian President Vladimir Putin to continue to do business with the U.S. as it makes an economic enemy out of every other country in the world. Canada and Mexico were also absent from the list because Trump had already hit them with 25 percent tariffs on all U.S. imports, according to Leavitt. The Trump administration seems to have destroyed global economies overnight while misunderstanding basic economics. In the wake of Donald Trump’s tariff announcement Wednesday, former New Yorker financial writer James Surowiecki pointed out that a column on Trump’s tariff sheet labeled “tariffs charged to the U.S.A.” was likely founded on bad math. “They didn’t actually calculate tariff rates + non-tariff barriers, as they say they did. Instead, for every country, they just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country’s exports to us,” Surowiecki argued. “So we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia. Its exports to us are $28 billion. $17.9/$28 = 64 percent, which Trump claims is the tariff rate Indonesia charges us.” “What extraordinary nonsense this is,” he added. That would mean that the Trump administration imposed earth-shattering tariff hikes on the rest of the world without looking at the whole picture. Mainly, that the administration calculated the tariffs charged by other countries by only looking at goods provided, rather than the combined value of goods and services—something that “most economists seem to think is an odd way to calculate tariffs,” according to BBC Verify’s Shayan Sardarizadeh. The White House initially refuted the tariff theory. White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai posted on X that “we literally calculated tariff and non tariff barriers.” But in an attempt to prove his point, Desai grabbed a formula from the US Treasury website that actually proved Surowiecki’s. Sardarizadeh broke it down. “∆τᵢ = (x-m) / (ε x φ x m),” he shared. “The formula includes ‘x’ for exports and ‘m’ for imports.” “But it also has ‘ε’ for ‘price elasticity of import demand’, set at 4 by the Treasury; multiplied by ‘φ’ for ‘elasticity of import prices’, set at 0.25 by the Treasury, which means they basically cancel out each other as 4 x 0.25 = 1,” Sardarizadeh continued. “So, in effect, all you’re left with in the formula is exports - imports / imports, which is what X users and journalists had accurately pointed out all along.” But the administration’s bad math only matters so much to the tariff-heavy agenda. Even in countries where the trade deficit was less than 10 percent, or even in countries where there was a surplus, Trump still tacked on a 10 percent tariff. Donald Trump announced a range of tariffs on nearly every country in the world—including, inexplicably, some practically uninhabited islands, one of which is home to a U.S. military base. The British Indian Ocean Territory, a small cluster of islands in the South Indian Ocean, was hit with 10 percent tariffs on U.S. imports from the Trump administration Wednesday as part of its Liberation Day announcement. The islands are mostly uninhabited, save for approximately 3,000 U.S. and U.K. military personnel who are stationed at a joint Navy Support Facility on the island Diego Garcia. Trump’s tariffs would mostly affect the service members there. Another roughly 1,200 people live on the country’s Chagos Archipelago. As one might expect from the name, the territory is owned by the United Kingdom, which Trump hit with a 10 percent tariff, relatively low compared to other countries. Trump also announced 10 percent tariffs on the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, an uninhabited Australian territory that was listed as a Unesco World Heritage site for its “complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.” Australia was saddled with a 10 percent tariff, as well. It’s unclear whether the tariffs on these territories would compound to 20 percent. Crucially, it’s unclear that anyone thought about this at all. Online, some speculated that the tariffs were doled out according to internet domains, and that because the Heart Island and McDonald Islands use a different domain (.hm) than Australia, (.au) they were considered different countries. That seemed to be the only explanation for levying a tariff on a territory that has no economy to speak of. Donald Trump claimed Wednesday that the United States entered the Great Depression as a result of turning its back on the policy of placing tariffs on other countries in favor of an income tax. During a winding speech to mark the so-called Liberation Day, Trump presented an alternative history where steep tariffs, like the ones he’d come to celebrate, could have prevented the worldwide economic disintegration of the early twentieth century. “From 1789 to 1913 we were a tariff-backed nation, and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been,” Trump said, adding that the U.S. was “collecting so much money, so fast, we didn’t know what to do with it! “Then, in 1913 for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government,” he said. “Then in 1928 it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression, and it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy; it would have been a much different story,” Trump said. “They tried to bring back tariffs to save our country, but it was gone. It was gone. It was too late, nothing could have been done.” Trump’s revisionist history is designed to promote his economic agenda—not reflect what actually happened. Not only could tariffs not have prevented the Great Depression, they made it even worse. In 1913, as the result of struggling farmers and Democrats advocating to establish an income tax, Republicans put up an income tax amendment, hoping that it would be rejected—it wasn’t, and the Sixteenth Amendment became law. At the same time, Congress passed the Underwood Simmons Tariff Act that lowered tariff rates from 40 percent to 27 percent, in a Democrat-backed effort to promote free trade. Crucially, tariffs were raised again in 1921, after Republican President Warren Harding entered the White House and began a reinvigorated era of protectionism. In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised tariffs in all sectors and is considered to have exacerbated the worldwide economic downturn that lasted from 1929 until 1939, by undermining international trade and affording little protection to domestic producers. Smoot-Hawley was disastrous not only for the U.S. economy, tanking U.S. exports to Europe from $2,341 million in 1929 to just $784 million in 1932, but also for global trade, which declined by a whopping 66 percent between 1929 and 1934, according to the U.S. Office of the Historian. The effects of Smoot-Hawley were so awful that it marked the end of steep tariffs in American trade policy for the rest of the twentieth century. Trump’s baseless insistence that lowered tariffs led to the Great Depression is representative of his entire economic policy, and just how untethered from reality it has become.

Title: Disney, Netflix, AI, More—Newest Winners In Digital Advertising

ByDavid Doty ByDavid Doty, Contributor. The race to digital dominance always has new players The worrisome, repeat noise about the lack of aggressive competition in digital advertising just doesn’t correspond to the reality of the industry. If you follow this column, you’ve know we cover the spectrum of ongoing dynamics in the field. For sure, there are complaints about news outrage fatigue, strangling AI slop, massive layoffs and odd doings at media companies owned loudly or quietly by billionaires (Hello, X, WashPo, LA Times and TIME to name just a few). All the handwringing couldn’t be further from the truth in the real marketplace. A simple step back to look at the big picture shows the entire digital ecosystem is growing at an incredible clip. Massive sums are being invested in AI, with a record, eye-popping $40-billion funding in OpenAI just announced. On the advertising front alone, spending in the U.S. reached $309.3 billion in 2024, a 15.1% increase over 2023, and it is expected to reach $460 billion by 2028. Other industries would kill for that kind of growth. And it’s not exclusily focused on a few, it’s spread among many, and new, players. For sure, the digital ecosystem has and will continue to change—radically. Who’s up, who’s down actually takes a lot of attention to understand. The simplistic view of the industry just isn’t the smart take. We’re all wearing seat belts and goggles as we discover the joys of being crash-test dummies in lightning-speed realignments that used to take years but are now happening in months and weeks (recent case in point: the rapid adoption of generative AI). Digital is hot all over, the state of play is dynamic—and growing like crazy. Disney reports its streaming platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) have an estimated 157 million global monthly active users on ad-supported tiers, including 112 million in the U.S. So, the lesson should be: Despite the influence of any incumbents in the field, new creative players with the right content can get a lot of people not just to watch ads but to opt into watching them. Simultaneously, Netflix, which we should remember started offering ads only two years ago, is projected to top $3.2 billion in ad revenue this year thanks to live sports and events, and more than half of that will come from the U.S. and Canada. Not bad for a nascent part of its business. CTV advertising? Emerging and struggling, some say. But this year it will reach $33.35 billion and is on its way to eclipsing linear TV in 2028. Change sometimes is hard—and then sometimes seems easier than we’d thought it would be. That other new virgorous channel, retail media, is also booming. Total retail media ad impressions surged past 75 billion at the end of 2025. Amazon remains the giant in this space, reporting $56.21 billion in revenue in 2024, and just five years ago that mostly retailer was barely a player in digital ads. Other retailers like Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Chewy and Sephora looked around and saw they, too, could compete in the digital advertising game and are now seeing a bigger and bigger share of ad impressions (and ad $$) come their way. There are more interesting fireworks in retail media, too. Despite all the noise about Chinese influence in other place, it turns out that small Chinese sellers make up nearly half of the new sellers added to Walmart’s retail media marketplace, following Amazon’s path (also 50%). With on-again/off-again/on-again/who-knows?again tariffs and how they are reshaping global trade dynamics, much could shift in that landscape and already has: Fast fashion retailer Shein’s profit was down 40% at the end of 2024, threatening the viability of the company’s IPO in 2025 and leaving the opportunity for other retailers to fill the void. Can U.S. domestics slip in to fill any voids–and capture not just the retail revenue but the data dominance? Also gaining ground are new corners of the digital media universe: Trusted recommendations from influencers are an ever-growing force for brands (CMOs, you ignore them at your peril) and the latest consumer powerhouse is communities that let customers talk to peers about products they love (and hate). They are gaining new power in the buying equation. And all that doesn’t even count the unforeseeable but certainly likely incredible speed at which new media can explode onto the scene. Snapchat took almost four years to hit 100 million users. TikTok got there in 9 months. ChatGPT did it in 8 weeks. Threads in 5 days! As I said, the state of play is dynamic and downright … quantum. So don’t believe in the negative or be a skeptic and fatalist: It’s an incredible time to be in the media business—whether you’re creating content, capturing attention, or some mix of both. Your business could be, faster than you know, larger than the largest now. Just look around at what is happening IRL.

Title: Everything You Need To Know About Muni Bonds Right Now

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Tax credit abstract concept vector illustration. Save money, calculate balance, government support, ... More business profit, income report, budget planning, bank card, savings refund abstract metaphor. The economy is slowing. And if you believe that these tariff-tapping brakes are going to land us in a recession, these muni bonds (with tax-equivalent yields up to 12.4%) are for you. This is the time to recession-proof our retirement holdings. The new administration appears to want to get a slowdown “out of the way” early. Atlanta’s GDPNow forecast says the economy is already shrinking: Fed GDPNow Forecast Meanwhile the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment report shows that confidence is falling fast. The index dropped to 57.9 in March—its lowest level since November 2022. Back then we were emerging from a sharp and painful 10-month bear market. Are we slipping into the bears’ claws again? If so, municipal bonds are an attractive income play. “Don’t fight Bessent” is the new cry from investors as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent bets the house on lower long-term interest rates. Munis traditionally rise as long rates fall, a common feature of recessions. Plus, munis offer big tax breaks. Let’s start with tax-free federal income options. Vanilla investors reach for iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB) and its 4.4% tax-advantaged yield. For high earners this is the equivalent of a 7% pre-tax dividend. Not bad. But we know better than to settle for a popular ETF. Closed-end funds tend to provide higher yields and discounts to boot. Our Contrarian Income Report favorite Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NEA), for example, yields 7.4% before tax breaks. For top earners, this equates to a tax-equivalent dividend up to 12.4%. NEA also trades at a 5% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Which means we can buy its portfolio of munis for 95 cents on the dollar. This discount window is a feature (not a bug!) of CEFs, which have fixed pools of shares and often trade at discounts to their NAVs. Live in a high-tax state? There are state-specific muni funds, too. Here are 10 CEFs to consider: 10 State Muni Bonds California buyers of Nuveen California Quality Municipal Income Fund (NAC) are paying just 95 cents on the dollar for their state-specific munis. These bond distributions then get a pass from Uncle Sam and Governor Gavin Newsom for a tax-equivalent yield over 17%. Muni bonds also tend to be safe. With default rates around 0.1%, they are the most secure fixed income plays beyond US Treasuries (which are currently bulletproof, at least from a default standpoint, thanks to our global printing press and world reserve currency.) And state “rainy day funds”—financial reserves for slowdowns—have reached historically high levels, touching $164 billion recently. This cushion helps secure the creditworthiness of state-specific munis. From a price gains perspective, munis are no longer the slam dunks they were in late 2022. I was pounding the table then to buy for the yields and upside. Today, it’s more about the safety because the price upside from here is likely limited. Why the measured outlook? First, while long rates have come down, there may be a floor nearby due to persistent inflation. Inflation data continues to come in above the Fed’s stated long-term target. As I write, the 10-year Treasury trades for 4.3%. Inflation is running at 2.8%. The coupon seems fair, especially given the Treasury Secretary has $9 trillion in debt to refinance this year. Second, there are risks to the tax benefits. The Biden administration’s 2025 budget proposal included a potential impact on muni exemptions. Past proposals have suggested capping tax benefits for high-income earners, key customers for these bonds. BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust (BBN) is a “Goldilocks” muni play for those of you with concerns about the tax code changing against munis. BBN yields 6.7% and will see an inflow of cash if federal or state tax privileges come under pressure. Not only that, but also BBN can be had for 96 cents on the dollar, thanks to its 4% discount to NAV. How are we handling our munis at CIR? We added NEA in October 2022 when the bond market was bottoming. The fund remains a Buy, but a cautious one—we are keeping eye on the political and inflationary risks to this fund and our two other muni positions. A taxable alternative like BBN is a potential income pivot, if necessary. We contrarians will keep it in mind. In the meantime, enjoy these fat tax-equivalent yields and their discounts. And when your friends ask, remind them to: “Don’t fight Bessent.” Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Nvidia, TSMC, chip stocks crash as Trump’s new tariffs shake semiconductor industry – How will rising costs and supply chain disruptions impact AI and tech companies?

Following Trump’s announcement, Nvidia stock fell over 5%, while its competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped about 4%. Broadcom (AVGO) saw a steep 7% decline, and Micron Technology (MU), a key memory chip supplier for Nvidia’s GPUs, also lost 7% in value. TSMC, the Taiwanese giant responsible for manufacturing advanced semiconductors for companies like Nvidia and Apple (AAPL), also sank approximately 5%. This reaction in the stock market reflects growing fears about supply chain disruptions and cost increases due to new tariff measures. Trump revealed that starting April 5, a 10% baseline tariff would be applied globally. However, from April 9 onward, reciprocal tariffs will be imposed based on individual countries’ trade practices: This move is expected to impact chip imports from these countries, which are major suppliers of AI servers, laptops, and other high-tech products to the U.S. These tariffs directly impact companies like Nvidia, which rely heavily on Taiwan and China for chip manufacturing. TSMC, the world’s leading semiconductor foundry, plays a critical role in producing chips for Nvidia, AMD, and even Intel (INTC). The U.S. imported around $19 billion in servers equipped with Nvidia GPUs from Taiwan and $34 billion from China in 2024, according to trade data compiled by Michigan State University’s supply chain expert Jason Miller. These tariffs will increase costs for U.S. companies relying on these imports, potentially slowing demand for AI chips and computing hardware. Trump has positioned these tariffs as a way to push companies to manufacture their chips in the U.S. He pointed to TSMC’s $100 billion investment in Arizona, an expansion that started under the Biden administration with support from the U.S. Chips and Science Act. However, industry experts are skeptical. Truist analyst William Stein surveyed 10 semiconductor manufacturers and distributors, and none indicated plans to move operations to the U.S. in response to these tariffs. One respondent even suggested that companies are avoiding major investments in new locations because they doubt these tariffs will be permanent. Despite the immediate stock drop, some analysts believe AI chipmakers like Nvidia may weather the storm better than others. Stein noted that AI companies are in an aggressive race to develop Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) at almost any cost, meaning demand for Nvidia’s GPUs may remain strong despite higher prices. However, long-term impacts remain uncertain. If these tariffs stay in place, they could lead to increased costs for U.S. tech companies, potential supply chain restructuring, and shifts in global chip manufacturing strategies. For now, investors and industry leaders will be closely watching how these tariffs unfold and whether further trade actions follow.

Title: Apple has its biggest stock drop in five years because of Trump’s tariffs

Amazon and Meta shares are down about 7 percent. Amazon and Meta shares are down about 7 percent. by Todd Haselton Shares of Apple, Amazon, and other tech stocks are getting walloped on Thursday as the markets digest the impact of President Donald Trump’s new round of tariffs announced on Wednesday evening. Shares of Apple were down about 9 percent on Thursday morning, which would mark the biggest drop in about five years if it holds until the close, according to CNBC. Amazon shares dropped about 7 percent. Both companies rely heavily on imports from other countries, like China, on which Trump plans to impose a 54 percent tariff beginning April 9th. Apple also manufactures some products in countries like Vietnam, on which a 46 percent tariff was announced. The tariffs, if they aren’t walked back, could mean increased prices on electronics for consumers or slimmer margins for companies like Apple and Amazon if they choose to eat some of the costs. Apple has typically had a gross margin, the amount of cash it gets to keep after it sells stuff, of around 38 percent, though it has been higher. Wall Street is likely concerned about lower demand if Apple has to increase the price of Macs, iPhones, iPads, and other products. Other big tech companies were impacted as well. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 4 percent on Thursday morning while Tesla stock was also down about 4 percent, giving up most of its Wednesday gains. Shares of Meta are down about 7 percent.

Apple (AAPL-5.92%) shares were down by 8.3% during afternoon trading on Thursday, leading the decline of Magnificent 7 stocks after President Donald Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” following the market close on Wednesday. At mid-day on Thursday, Amazon was down by 7.2%, Nvidia was down by 6.2%, Meta was down by 5.8%, Tesla was down by 4.3%, Alphabet was down by 3.1%, and Microsoft was down by 1.4%. During pre-market trading, Apple had been down by 8.2%, while Amazon (AMZN-0.99%) was down by 6.7%, Meta (META-3.35%) was down by 6.6%, Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%) was down by 6.2%, Tesla (TSLA-8.68%) was down by 6.2%, Alphabet (GOOGL-1.04%) was down by 3.8%, and Microsoft (MSFT-2.15%) was down by 1.9%. Meanwhile, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all pointed to a lower opening on Thursday morning. The Trump administration’s tariffs are being applied on a country-by-country basis, and are calculated by combining the rate of tariffs, non-monetary barriers, “and other forms of cheating.” Trump said the U.S. will charge other countries “approximately half” of their charges. “April, 2, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” Trump said on Wednesday, adding that his tariffs are the “declaration of economic independence.” Baseline 10% tariffs are expected to go into effect on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET, while reciprocal levies are set to be effective on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. Jefferies (JEF-9.07%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that the Trump administration’s 54% tariffs on China and 26% tariffs on India “caused a selloff on the Apple supply chain.” The analysts said it is currently unclear if Apple will be exempted from the tariffs as it was during Trump’s first administration in 2018, and that the company’s plan to invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years could “help it get exemption.” “The simple thought is likely that Apple’s products will be subject to this tariff, and thus demand will get hit and thus the supply chain will suffer,” Jefferies analysts said. “[I]n the worst case,” the analysts estimated that if Apple’s iPhone imports are subject to the 54% tariff on China and the company absorbs the cost to avoid a negative impact on sales volume, its full year net profit could be reduced by 14%. “It is possible for AAPL to raise price and pass on some tariff burden to high-end consumers without affecting volume too much (upside to our forecast), but that may be offset by the fact that some non-iPhone products would also create additional [negative] impact on AAPL’s earnings,” Jefferies analysts said. However, the analysts said that even if Apple is exempted from the reciprocal tariffs, “it will need to accelerate its supply chain diversification efforts, and thus needs to pay its suppliers better and give more share to those who could help AAPL achieve this objective.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Amazon and Meta shares are down about 7 percent. by Todd Haselton Shares of Apple, Amazon, and other tech stocks are getting walloped on Thursday as the markets digest the impact of President Donald Trump’s new round of tariffs announced on Wednesday evening. Shares of Apple were down about 9 percent on Thursday morning, which would mark the biggest drop in about five years if it holds until the close, according to CNBC. Amazon shares dropped about 7 percent. Both companies rely heavily on imports from other countries, like China, on which Trump plans to impose a 54 percent tariff beginning April 9th. Apple also manufactures some products in countries like Vietnam, on which a 46 percent tariff was announced. The tariffs, if they aren’t walked back, could mean increased prices on electronics for consumers or slimmer margins for companies like Apple and Amazon if they choose to eat some of the costs. Apple has typically had a gross margin, the amount of cash it gets to keep after it sells stuff, of around 38 percent, though it has been higher. Wall Street is likely concerned about lower demand if Apple has to increase the price of Macs, iPhones, iPads, and other products. Other big tech companies were impacted as well. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 4 percent on Thursday morning while Tesla stock was also down about 4 percent, giving up most of its Wednesday gains. Shares of Meta are down about 7 percent.

In a “21 and 21” rapid-fire interview with Haley Berkoe at San Francisco’s Presidio Bitcoin workspace, Jack Dorsey—CEO of Block and former Twitter chief—cautioned that BTC’s growing popularity among major financial institutions could threaten the open ethos that gave rise to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. “It probably harms it a bit,” Dorsey said when asked about institutional investment in Bitcoin. Yet he acknowledged that large-scale involvement is practically inevitable, adding, “I think it’s obvious that we’ll see more of it, and I hope that more people take on the principles of what made Bitcoin successful in the first place.” Speaking on the emergence of institutional giants like BlackRock, Dorsey emphasized the permissionless nature of Bitcoin: “To be able to work on a money transmission protocol that’s entirely open […] that has converted the likes of a BlackRock or these major institutions that we railed against in the past—and now they have to turn their attention to it—and yet you still don’t need their permission to build on it […] where else can you find that?” Dorsey’s comments came during a conversation that spanned everything from his early interest in “the old cypherpunks” to the projects Block is building to strengthen the core infrastructure. He highlighted ongoing work on an “open source mining rig and chipset,” as well as Bitkey, a self-custodial wallet, and Block’s integration of BTC into Cash App. One of Dorsey’s main concerns is that Bitcoin might end up sidelined if it focuses too narrowly on serving as a store of value. “I think it fails through irreverence—like it just fails to be relevant to people on a daily basis,” he remarked. According to him, ensuring widespread use for payments is key to making BTC indispensable. “If it just ends up being store of value and nothing more, I don’t think it gains relevance at all. I think it has to be payments for it to be relevant on the everyday,” Dorsey said, warning that otherwise Bitcoin risks “just not showing up in people’s lives” and slipping into obscurity. A noted Bitcoin advocate, Dorsey nonetheless believes that focusing solely on the Lightning Network—a leading Layer 2 solution—could limit BTC’s evolution. “I think we can do better than Lightning,” he said, clarifying that while Lightning “isn’t bad,” it’s merely one option. “I don’t think we just want to settle with having one Layer 2,” he explained, emphasizing that Bitcoin benefits most from experimentation in payments and other applications. Dorsey consistently returned to the importance of open-source development, urging companies to fund Bitcoin Core and other community-driven projects without exerting control. “Having some sort of granting ability to open-source developers is important,” he said, praising initiatives such as Spiral—a BTC-focused division of Block—along with independent grant programs like Brink and OpenSats. He also mentioned the emerging role of artificial intelligence and its interplay with BTC, envisioning a future where agents could seamlessly transact on behalf of users. “It’s all about who you’re asking permission from,” he said. “Development goes faster if you have to ask for less permission.” The setting for the interview, Presidio Bitcoin, underscores Dorsey’s belief in bringing real-world communities together to foster deeper engagement. “I think this is great because it is a bridge between Silicon Valley and all the energy down there, and Bitcoin,” he noted, highlighting the need for physical spaces where ideas can germinate into tangible projects. From building more accessible wallets to reinforcing the permissionless nature of Bitcoin, Dorsey sees plenty of work ahead. When asked what single thought he would leave with newcomers, he insisted that nobody should rely on one person’s word—his included—before diving into the space: “Don’t listen to anyone’s single thought about Bitcoin,” he said. “What makes Bitcoin special is it’s permissionless. You don’t need anyone’s permission to build what you want to see.” At press time, BTC traded at $83,523. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: “This Is Existential”: Billionaire Cancer Researcher Says Covid & Vaccine Likely Causing Surge In Aggressive Cancers
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/this-is-existential-billionaire-cancer-researcher-says-covid-vaccine-likely-causing-surge-in-aggressive-cancers/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Health Tyler Durden, ZeroHedge Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong – a transplant surgeon-turned-biotech billionaire renowned for inventing the cancer drug Abraxane – has issued a startling warning in a new in-depth interview with Tucker Carlson. Soon-Shiong, founder of ImmunityBio ($IBRX) and owner of the Los Angeles Times, claims that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the very vaccines developed to fight it, may be contributing to a global surge in “terrifyingly aggressive” cancers. In the nearly two-hour conversation, the Los Angeles Times owner leveraged his decades of clinical and scientific experience to outline why he suspects an unprecedented cancer epidemic is unfolding. This report examines Dr. Soon-Shiong’s background and assertions, the scientific responses for and against his claims, new data on post-COVID health trends, and the far-reaching implications if his alarming hypothesis proves true. Soon-Shiong is a veteran surgeon and immunologist who has spent a career studying the human immune system’s fight against cancer. He pioneered novel immunotherapies and even worked on a T-cell based COVID vaccine booster during the pandemic. In the interview, he draws on this background to voice deep concern over rising cancer cases, especially among younger people – something he describes as a “non-infectious pandemic” of cancer. He tells Carlson that in 50 years of medical practice, it was extraordinarily rare to see cancers like pancreatic tumors in children or young adults, yet recently such cases are appearing. For instance, Soon-Shiong was alarmed by seeing a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer, a scenario virtually unheard of in his prior experience. “I never saw pancreatic cancer in children… the greatest surprise to me was a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer,” Soon-Shiong told Carlson, adding that he’s seen examples of very young patients (even children under 11 with colon cancer) and unusual surges in aggressive diseases like ovarian cancer in women in their 30s. These personal observations of more frequent, aggressive cancers in youth led him to probe what might have changed in recent years. “We’re clearly seeing an increase in certain types of cancer, like pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer… colon cancer… in younger people.”— Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong According Soon-Shiong, the COVID era is the obvious change – and suggests that both the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and the widespread vaccination campaigns could be key drivers behind this cancer spike. He emphasizes the massive scale of human exposure to the virus and its spike protein (via infection or vaccination). “I don’t know how to say that without saying it. It scares the pants off me because I think what we may be, I don’ think it’s virus versus man now, this is existential. I think when I talk about the largest non-infectious pandemic that we’re afraid of, this is it.” “Billions of people – literally billions – had the COVID virus. Over a billion got the spike protein vaccine,” said Carlson, adding “So that’s like, we’re talking like a huge percentage of the Earth’s population, unless I’m missing something.” “Now you understand what keeps you awake at night and kept me awake at night for two years, two and a half years,” Soon-Shiong replied, suggesting that exposure to both is silently undermining the immune system’s natural defenses against cancer on a global scale. Soon-Shiong frames COVID-era cancers as potentially virally triggered or exacerbated. In the interview, he described cases of “virally induced cancers” in clinics during the pandemic – patients whose cancers may have been kicked into overdrive by the cascade of inflammation and immune stress associated with COVID-19 (Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong: You’re Being Lied to About Cancer, How It’s Caused, and How to Stop It). COVID infection causes a massive inflammatory response, and some cancers are known to exploit inflammation to grow. TUCKER: “a lot people have pointed to both COVID, the virus, and to the mRNA COVID vaccines as potential causes. Do you think that they’re related?“ SOON-SHIONG: “The best way for me to answer that is to look at history. What we know about virally-induced cancers is well-established. We know that if you get hepatitis, you get liver cancer. Hepatitis is a virus infection. We know if you got human papillomavirus, HPV, you get cervical cancer.” We know that certain viruses directly cause cancer (e.g. HPV, Epstein-Barr), so it’s not unprecedented for a virus to play a role in oncogenesis. While SARS-CoV-2 is not a known oncovirus, Soon-Shiong worries its indirect effects – chronic inflammation, immune exhaustion, or “suppressor cells” that emerge in the wake of infection/vaccination – could be accelerating tumor development. “The answer is to stop the inflammation…clear the virus from the body,” he argues, positing that until we eradicate lingering virus and restore immune balance, we may see mounting cancer cases. In sum, Dr. Soon-Shiong’s claim is that the pandemic has set the stage for an explosion of aggressive cancers: the COVID virus itself (especially if it persists in survivors) might suppress immune surveillance, and the mRNA vaccines “that didn’t stop it” might inadvertently contribute to an immunosuppressive environment. These effects, in his theory, could be unleashing cancers that the immune system would ordinarily have kept in check. Watch: Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong is a surgeon who made billions inventing cancer drugs. He says that Covid, and the vaccines that didn’t stop it, are likely causing a global epidemic of terrifyingly aggressive cancers.(0:00) Why Are Cancer Rates Rising in Young People?(6:16) What Is… pic.twitter.com/5QO8AWLtXx A number of clinicians and researchers have reported similar worrying observations, though these remain largely anecdotal at this stage. One prominent voice echoing Soon-Shiong’s concern is Dr. Angus Dalgleish, a veteran oncologist and professor at St. George’s, University of London. In late 2022, Dalgleish wrote to the BMJ’s editor after noticing that some cancer patients who had been stable for years experienced “rapid progression of their disease after a COVID-19 booster.” He cited cases of individuals who were doing well until shortly after vaccination – new leukemias, sudden appearance of Stage IV lymphomas, and explosive metastases in patients who had post-vaccine bouts of feeling unwell. “I am experienced enough to know that these are not coincidental,” Dalgleish wrote, noting that colleagues in Germany, Australia and the U.S. were independently seeing the same pattern. This frontline testimony aligns with Soon-Shiong’s fear: something about the immune system post-vaccination might be removing restraints on latent cancers. Dalgleish specifically pointed to short-term innate immune suppression after mRNA vaccination (lasting for several weeks) as a plausible mechanism. Many of the cancers he saw were ones normally held in check by immune surveillance (melanomas and B-cell cancers), so a temporary post-vaccine drop in immune vigilance could allow a tumor growth spurt. He also alluded to “suppressor gene suppression by mRNA in laboratory experiments” – a reference to preliminary studies that found the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein might interfere with key DNA repair or tumor-suppressor proteins in cells. These lab findings (while not yet confirmed in living organisms) lend some biological plausibility to the idea that spike exposure could affect cancer-related pathways. Beyond individual doctors, some research is probing links between COVID and cancer behavior. For example, a 2022 study in Frontiers in Oncology explored how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with cancer cells. It found that the virus’s membrane (M) protein can “induce the mobility, proliferation and in vivo metastasis” of triple-negative breast cancer cells in the lab (Frontiers | SARS-CoV-2 M Protein Facilitates Malignant Transformation of Breast Cancer Cells). In co-culture experiments, breast cancer cells exposed to the viral protein essentially became more aggressive and invasive. The researchers concluded that COVID-19 infection “might promote…aggressive [cancer] phenotypes” and warned that cancer patients who get COVID could face worse outcomes. While this is one specific context (breast cancer cells and one viral protein), it underpins Soon-Shiong’s general concern: the virus can directly alter the tumor microenvironment to the cancer’s advantage. Another line of evidence involves latent viruses and inflammation. Doctors have documented unusual reactivations of viruses like Epstein-Barr (which is linked to lymphomas and other malignancies) during both COVID-19 and post-vaccine immune reactions. Such reactivations hint at a period of immune dysregulation that might also let nascent cancer cells slip past defenses. Or course,fact-checkers and medical authorities argue that there is no credible evidence of vaccines causing meaningful immune suppression. “There isn’t evidence to date that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer or lead to worsening cancer,” one infectious disease expert told FactCheck.org, though they do acknowledge rare side effects like myocarditis or blood clots were found, but not cancer. While the scientific community debates mechanistic links between COVID and cancer, independent analysts have been parsing population-level data for unusual patterns. One notable effort is by Phinance Technologies, a research firm co-founded by former BlackRock portfolio manager Edward Dowd. Phinance has been analyzing excess mortality and disability data since the pandemic, looking for signals of broad health impacts in the aftermath of COVID and mass vaccination. Their findings reveal concerning trends, especially among younger, working-age populations, that lend some weight to Dr. Soon-Shiong’s general warning of a post-COVID health crisis (though not specific to cancer alone). Phinance’s “Vaccine Damage Project” examined the U.S. population aged 16–64 (essentially the workforce) and stratified outcomes into four groups: no effect, mild injuries, severe injuries (disabilities), and death. Using official government databases (the CDC, Bureau of Labor Statistics, etc.), they estimated how each category changed starting in 2021 – when vaccines rolled out and COVID became widespread. The results are sobering. According to Phinance’s analysis, by the end of 2022 the U.S. had experienced approximately 310,000 excess deaths among adults aged 25-64 (a ~23% increase in mortality in that group over normal expectations). Notably, they argue that after mid-2021, with vaccines available and the virus itself becoming less deadly (due to immunity and milder variants), COVID-19 should not have been causing such high excess death rates. Therefore, those 310k “unexplained” deaths in 2021–2022 could represent an upper bound on vaccine-related fatalities or other pandemic collateral damage. Even more striking is the data on new disabilities. Phinance found that from early 2021 through late 2022, about 1.36 million additional Americans (age 16–64) became disabled – a 24.6% rise in disability in that cohort, far above historical trend. This jump in disabilities among the workforce correlates in time with the vaccine rollout (and was disproportionately higher in the labor force than among those not working). The analysts note that the healthiest segment of the population (employed working-age adults) saw a greater relative increase in disabilities after Q1 2021 than the older or non-working groups. This is unusual, since typically health shocks hit the elderly hardest – but here something was impacting younger, healthy people to a significant degree. Phinance investigated further and found a tight relationship between the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered and the rise in disabilities in 2021-22. In fact, for the 16–64 population, they computed a ratio of about 4 new disabilities per excess death in that period, suggesting many survivors were left with lingering health issues even if they didn’t die.

Title: Outsmarting The System: White Fonting, Fake Reviews, And Résumé Hacks

ByDr. Diane Hamilton ByDr. Diane Hamilton, Contributor. Outsmarting The System: White Fonting, Fake Reviews, And Résumé Hacks Never underestimate people’s ability to get creative. Job seekers are adding invisible keywords to résumés to beat applicant tracking systems. Students are using AI tools like ChatGPT to rewrite essays in ways traditional plagiarism detectors cannot always catch. Amazon sellers are inflating ratings with fake reviews, and content creators are joining engagement pods to fool social media algorithms. Across industries, individuals are finding ways to get past automated filters, strict systems, and rigid evaluation processes. In many cases, it is about outsmarting processes that feel impossible to navigate fairly. What may seem like manipulation often reflects frustration, curiosity, and a desire to be seen. From white fonting to résumé rewriting to gaming content platforms, these behaviors raise bigger questions. If people are constantly outsmarting the system, what does that say about the system itself? And what can leaders, hiring teams, and educators learn from these increasingly common tactics? What Is White Fonting And Why Are Job Seekers Outsmarting The System? White fonting is a résumé trick where applicants insert key phrases in white text so they are invisible to human readers but still readable by applicant tracking systems. A candidate applying for a marketing role might hide words like HubSpot, content strategy, or Google Ads throughout their document even if they lack those skills. The goal is to bypass keyword filters and get a shot at an interview. While it may seem dishonest, many job seekers using white fonting do not see it that way. They are trying to be noticed in a system that feels too automated, too rigid, and too competitive. For them, outsmarting the résumé filter is more of a survival skill than a scam. Do Résumé Hacks Still Work When Outsmarting AI Filters? Résumé hacks like white fonting, keyword stuffing, and AI-generated job applications can still work in some cases. In addition to hiding text, job seekers may repeat desirable phrases or inflate their job titles to appear more qualified. However, today’s applicant tracking systems are more sophisticated. Many strip formatting, detect excessive repetition, and flag suspicious content. Outsmarting the AI might work once, but it can also backfire if a recruiter notices inconsistencies or patterns that look inauthentic. What is more telling is why candidates feel they have to use these tactics in the first place. In a process designed to automate decisions, standing out as a human is becoming harder. How Students Have Been Outsmarting Plagiarism Detectors For Years Before white fonting showed up in résumés, I had already seen similar tactics in education. Some of my own students told me they used to wrap copied text in white quotation marks to get around plagiarism software. These days, it's more likely they’re using ChatGPT to rewrite their papers. But getting around the system isn’t new. Students have found ways to outsource their work for years. I once had a student submit a paper that included the following at the bottom, something she clearly forgot to delete: “Thank you for purchasing this paper. That will be fifteen dollars.” I believe the price has gone up since then. While those kinds of shortcuts were easier to spot, the tools students use now are more sophisticated. Grammarly, for example, was widely recommended as a writing aid, and many schools encouraged its use. But now it sometimes gets flagged in AI detection reports. What was once a tool to support learning might now complicate things. Whether it is helpful or harmful often depends on the intent behind it and the system doing the reviewing. Detection tools have gotten better at spotting tricks by looking at context and removing formatting. But the bigger issue is still there. When students believe the system is more focused on catching them than helping them learn, they will always find a way around it. Other Ways People Are Outsmarting Digital Systems The same mindset driving white fonting and AI-written essays shows up across nearly every platform. Social media influencers use engagement pods to artificially boost visibility. Sellers use brushing scams and fake reviews to rank higher on e-commerce sites. SEO specialists use keyword stuffing and cloaked pages to rise in search rankings. Test takers use screen mirroring, hidden devices, or even fake webcam movement to fool remote proctoring. Outsmarting the system has become a skill. But it is often a response to the feeling that the system itself is no longer working for the individual. Still, it raises a fair question. If people spent as much time doing the work as they do trying to get around it, wouldn’t that be more productive? Maybe. But when someone feels the odds are stacked against them, working around the system can feel like the only way forward. Why Outsmarting The System Happens In The First Place This behavior is not always about deception. More often, it is about frustration. People feel unseen by machines and blocked by rules they do not understand. They want in but do not know how to navigate the filters standing in the way. There is something deeper too. People are naturally curious. They test boundaries, push limits, and explore loopholes not always to break the rules but to understand them. Outsmarting is not always defiance. Sometimes it is innovation. Is Outsmarting The System Always Cheating? White fonting and similar behaviors fall on a spectrum. Sometimes they are clever ways to gain visibility. Other times they cross the line into deception. But if people are bending the rules just to be considered fairly, it may be time to examine the rules themselves. For job seekers, students, and creators, the issue is often not about ethics but about access. They are asking how else they can get a chance. How HR Professionals Can Respond To People Outsmarting The Hiring Process Rather than punish manipulation, HR teams should examine what is driving it. If people are outsmarting your hiring process, that is a signal. It means the process is perceived as unfair, overly filtered, or too impersonal. Here is what organizations can do: The best candidates may not always look perfect on paper. Sometimes, the most valuable hires are the ones trying the hardest to be seen. How Former Employees Are Outsmarting Company Reputation Systems The same mindset of outsmarting applies to company review sites. Some former employees have found ways to manipulate platforms like Glassdoor to damage an employer’s reputation. Tactics include mass posting negative reviews under multiple fake accounts, copy-pasting slightly altered feedback to create volume, or coordinating group efforts to flood a company’s page. Others wait for news of layoffs or leadership changes and time their reviews for maximum visibility. While Glassdoor uses fraud detection tools to identify suspicious content, no system is perfect. Some coordinated attacks can still get through. These actions are attempts to outsmart a system that may feel like the only way to hold a company accountable. For HR leaders and executives, these incidents are a reminder that reputation systems must be monitored, but they must also be trusted enough not to invite sabotage. What Outsmarting The System Says About Organizational Culture If people feel they need to cheat your system, the system may be part of the problem. White fonting, fake reviews, AI-generated content, and even coordinated review attacks all stem from environments where trust in the process has broken down. Instead of reinforcing complexity, organizations should examine what is encouraging these behaviors in the first place. Outsmarting the systems provides feedback. People are still trying. They want in. They are just not convinced that playing by the rules will work. The Real Question Behind Outsmarting The System Most people do not try to outsmart systems they trust. If outsmarting the system is happening everywhere, from classrooms to job boards to e-commerce platforms, it deserves serious attention. I once interviewed Dr. John Kotter, a renowned Professor Emeritus at Harvard Business School and a leading expert on leadership and change. His work on resistance is especially relevant in this context because when people do not feel empowered within a system, they often look for ways to work around it. They are not necessarily resisting the outcome but rather the structure that feels unfair or unyielding. The future of work will increasingly depend on automation and algorithms, but it must also allow space for trust, transparency, and human creativity. If someone is trying to outsmart your system, the more important question is not how to stop them but what their actions are revealing about the system itself. Outsmarting the system is not going away, but there is an opportunity to design systems that are strong, fair, and human in ways that reduce the desire to bypass them.

Title: Trump’s “Reciprocal Tariffs” Escalate Economic War Against the World
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-economic-war-world/5883370
Time Published: 2025-04-03T13:36:19Z
Full Content:
It has been driven forward by two interconnected objectives. On the economic front, it seeks to extract hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff hikes, ultimately paid for by US companies and consumers, to shore up the ever-worsening trade and financial position of the US, while weakening its global economic rivals, particularly China, to improve its trade position. It also aims to enhance US military capacity by using tariffs to force companies, foreign and domestic, to increase the level of their operations on American soil, much of which is needed to supply the military. Under the new regime, the US will impose “reciprocal tariffs” on a range of countries. The tariff is not determined by the tariff actually charged on US exports. Rather, a number has been assigned to each of the countries involved. This includes not only the tariff charged on US exports, but all measures such as subsidies, regulations, bio-security measures for agricultural products, and the value of the currency, which the US considers to have the same effect as a tariff in discriminating against the US. The reciprocal tariff to be charged has been set at half that number. Thus, for China, a key target of the new regime, the number assigned to it by US economic officials is 67, and the reciprocal tariff will be 34 percent. This will be on top of the 20 percent tariff already imposed on Chinese goods, bringing the total tariff level to 54 percent. One of the immediate effects of the tariff hike, set to come into effect on April 9, will be a major price increase for a vast range of goods made in China and purchased by American consumers. The European Union, which Trump has denounced as an organisation set up to “screw” the US, has been assigned the number 39, and the tariff impost will be 20 percent. Southeast Asian countries—a number of which have become a center of manufacturing operations for many companies seeking to escape the effect of trade bans on China—will be hit even harder. The tariff for Thailand will be 36 percent, Malaysia 24 percent and Vietnam 46 percent. The tariff for South Korea, already hit by the 25 percent tariff on “foreign-made” cars, which came into effect at midnight, will be 25 percent. And the list goes on. All countries not hit with a “reciprocal tariff” will have a 10 percent tariff imposed on their exports, in a measure aimed, in part, at preventing companies from transferring some of their operations to countries not specifically targeted by the US. Now there is nowhere in the world they can go. Trump began his presentation of the new tariff regime in the White House Rose Garden with his now customary rant against the rest of the world. “For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” he said, remarking later that in some cases friends had been worse than foes. “For years, hard-working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense, but now it’s our turn to prosper.” However, the repeated claims by Trump that the tariff measures are going to produce a new golden age for the US are a fiction. They will not bring down inflation but raise prices on a vast range of goods. The auto tariffs are set to raise prices on cars from anywhere between $3,000 and $10,000. Thousands of jobs will be lost, and any new plants set up in the US will be highly automated, with a small labour force to cut costs. Furthermore, the so-called “American-made” is non-existent. Every car in the world, including in the US, is the product of a complex international division of labour. For example, the Ford F-150 pickup truck, one of the standard bearers for what is regarded as an “American” car, comprises thousands of parts imported from all over the world. Trump claims the new tariff regime is a magic cure-all that is going to both pay down US government debt and reduce the trade deficit. But estimates of the expected tariff revenue, according to Capital Economics, are that at most, it will bring in around $800 billion. The interest bill alone on the US debt, now at around $36 trillion and rising, is $1 trillion every year as it fast becomes the biggest item in the budget. The trade policies of the Trump administration are internally contradictory. On the one hand, it wants to expand US export markets by weakening the value of the US dollar, thereby making American goods cheaper in world markets. But maintenance of its reserve currency status, which Trump regards as an existential issue for the US—losing it, he has said, would be the equivalent of losing a war—depends on a strong dollar. Moreover, however much Trump harks back to President William McKinley and his tariff regime at the turn of the 20th century, the US economy has long outgrown its national borders and is dependent on an expanding global economy. But the global economy, already experiencing some of the lowest growth in decades, is now about to take another major blow. According to calculations published earlier this week in the Financial Times, the overall hit to the world economy could be in the order of $1.4 trillion if, as is virtually certain, there is retaliation. On top of this, there is growing nervousness in financial markets—already in a fragile condition because of the rise in global debt—both of governments and corporations. This was expressed in the letter by Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, to shareholders this week. He said, “protectionism has returned in force” and that in his conversations, people were “more anxious about the economy than at any time in recent memory.” Recent memory, it should be noted, includes the global financial crisis of 2008 and the financial crisis of March 2020, which saw the freezing of the US Treasury bond market. Trump is imposing the sweeping tariff regime under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, passed under the Democratic Carter administration, which gives him the power to declare a national emergency if there is an “unusual and extraordinary” threat from outside the US that impacts national security, foreign policy or the economy. The so-called Fact Sheet issued by the White House said the national emergency was the result of the large and persistent trade deficit. It was $918 billion in 2024, an increase of 17 percent from the previous year. The White House statement made clear that military considerations are a central driving force of the new tariff regime. The “reciprocal tariffs” are directed against countries “with which the US has the largest trade deficits,” but virtually every time economic matters are raised in the document, they are linked with military issues. It said that “pernicious” economic policies and practices of trading partners undermined US ability to produce goods for the public “and the military, threatening national security.” “‘Made in America’,” it declared, “is not just a tagline—it’s an economic and national security priority of this administration.” US stockpiles of military goods were “too low to be compatible with national defense interests,” and developments in bio-manufacturing, batteries and microelectronics had to be made “to support defense needs.” Explaining the focus on non-tariff barriers, particularly with regard to China, it said they had not only undermined US competitiveness but threatened “US economic and national security by increasing our reliance on foreign-controlled supply chains for critical industries, as well as everyday goods.” The Fact Sheet outlined the central core of the economic war. “Today’s IEEPA Order,” it said, “also contains modification authority, allowing President Trump to increase the tariff if trading partners retaliate or decrease the tariffs if trading partners take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align with the United States on economic and national security matters.” In other words, get in line or you will be hit—and even harder if you lift a finger. The tariff measures are not just a preparation for war—they are certainly that, and in earlier times could have been considered an act of war. Today, the lines between the states of war and peace are blurred, as the war on the economic front is tied directly to the expansionist drive of US imperialism—the threats to make Canada the 51st state, the ongoing operations to take over Greenland, and the increased bombing of the Houthis in Yemen, to name just a few. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Will Trump's New Tariffs Drive Up Headset Prices In The US?

With a 54% tariff set to apply to Chinese-made goods and 46% for Vietnam, will the price of VR headsets in the US soon increase? Enacted by President Trump via executive order yesterday, the new import tariffs are set to take effect from April 9, next Wednesday. They apply to goods manufactured in these countries, not just sold by companies from them. And while there are some exemptions, VR headsets aren't on that list. Most headsets today, including Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest, PlayStation VR2, and Pico, are made in either China, Vietnam, or both. While Trump had already placed a 20% tariff on Chinese imports in recent months, headset companies could plausibly absorb these added costs, and he hadn't yet applied a tariff to electronics made in Vietnam. But with tariffs moving to 54% and 46% for China and Vietnam respectively, it seems very unlikely that most headset companies will be able to avoid increasing prices. For example, analyst estimates placed the cost to Meta of each Quest 3 at around $430, excluding R&D and other indirect costs, and thus the new tariffs should bring this to around $650, significantly higher than its current $500 price. Could we soon see a $700 Quest 3, $500 Quest 3S, and PlayStation VR2 move back to $550? Even the US-assembled Bigscreen Beyond 2 would feel the heat from the tariffs. Most of its components, such as its expensive micro-OLED displays from China, would be affected. And this cost would almost certainly need to be passed on to the buyer. Meta has been moving around half of Quest production to Vietnam, to avoid the tariffs Trump was expected to place on China. But with Vietnam hit too, this diversification won't make a major difference. Not every company will necessarily need to increase prices, though. The same analyst estimates place the cost to Apple of each Vision Pro at around $1700, also excluding R&D and other indirect costs, and thus Apple could still be making an acceptable profit even if the cost soon rises to around $2500. Consumer hardware companies typically build up large stock pools in each country they sell in, so we're not expecting to see Quest and PS VR2 prices suddenly jump next week. But eventually the US stock of these headsets will run out. And when new units are coming in at around 50% higher cost, how could the current US prices hold? Of course, it's possible that President Trump scales back or cancels these tariffs entirely by then. Trump's administration has described tariffs as a mechanism of putting pressure on countries to make certain policy changes, and perhaps the US president decides his aims have been satisfied before US headset stockpiles run out. The rapidly shifting global political landscape makes definitive predictions here impossible, so we'll be keeping a close eye on the situation over the coming weeks and months.

Plaid has raised $575 million in a secondary share sale that sees the open banking platform's valuation drop from $13.4 billion in 2021 to $6.1 billion. 1 03 April 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Ribbit Capital, NEA, Fidelity Management & Research Co, BlackRock, and Franklin Templeton joined the round, which will give some Plaid employees the chance to cash out restricted stock that expires at the end of 2025. Plaid CEO Zach Perret tells CNBC that the firm has seen "substantial" growth over the last year but that the valuation drop is part of wider market conditions. Says Perret: “The reality is our business is much stronger and revenue has grown quite substantially. The profitability of business has gotten quite a lot better, and yet we are impacted by market multiples, as many companies are.” He adds that while an IPO is still the plan, "we still have a lot of internal work to do. We're not ready, which is why we didn't consider it right now." Founded in 2012, Plaid helps consumers connect their financial accounts from over 12000 providers to more than 8000 fintech providers. The firm's 2021 $13.5 billion valuation came months after it was forced to abandon a $5.3 billion takeover by Visa after the US Justice Department moved to block the deal over competition concerns.

Title: Volatile Markets Drive Crypto Industry To Innovative Further
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2025/04/03/volatile-markets-drive-crypto-industry-to-innovative-further/

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. Recession stock market financial chart on a trading board background. There are concerns about an impending recession in the United States, with JP Morgan raising its probability to 40 percent, up from 30 percent at the beginning of the year, and Goldman Sachs raising the probability to 20 percent. The “Trump bump” has waned with the U.S. stock markets down since the start of 2025, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the sell off down nearly 8 percent. Following “liberation day” where President Trump announced new tariffs on U.S. imports, a new era of trade competition has markets selling off and many economists predicting a rise in U.S. inflation. The President, said he expected his plans on tariffs, at the highest level in more than a century, would create problems in the financial markets but usher in a “a booming economy.” Last month in relation to tariffs, the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the market drop a “healthy correction.” Similarly, Kevin Hassett, head of the National Economic Council, said, “There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward. But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data.” Crypto markets, which are highly correlated to tech stocks, have shed over $1 trillion in the past weeks. Crypto veterans know volatility is a fundamental aspect of market dynamics. During transient market conditions, experienced crypto allocators and developers return to the trenches and focus on driving crypto innovation. Extended periods of market volatility often present opportunities for investing in and building new and better crypto products. The crypto economy beyond BTC and ETH can often lack a solid grounding as liquidity circulates from one narrative to another. Instead of generating revenue from businesses with strong fundamentals, shifting capital reserves can often obstruct the industry’s sustainable growth. The memecoin market has shrunk by over 57 percent, from $125 billion in December 2024 to $53 billion in March 2025. Investors’ primary activity has been rotating capital allocation as $485 million flowed out of Solana to Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BNB Chain in February 2025. Byron Gilliam, market strategist and uber-industry pundit at Blockworks says, “Memecoins are not stocks, of course, they’re lottery tickets — some of which do pay off.” Gilliam highlights the memecoin launchpad pump.fun has generated $600 million of revenue in its short 14-month existence and users don’t have much to show for it: Of the 8.7 million tokens launched, only four now have market caps above $100 million. The memecoin market is driven mainly by retail investors. The Dow Investing Versus Gambling chart lays out the continuum of expected returns to uncertainty that most serious financial professionals involved in allocating capital to and developing the crypto and digital asset ecosystem are at pains to point this out. Lotteries are the last stop on the uncertainty axis, following casino gambling. There is a strong argument that memecoins are not cryptoassets, per se. Investing Versus Gambling Roshan Dharia, CEO of Echo Base, a crypto holding company, has elaborated on the retail investor’s plight within the crypto domain saying, “No doubt Memecoins have been instrumental in onboarding the crypto-curious, however, to build a sustainable financial market, the crypto industry must stay focused on building products with real economic utility that solve real world problems. “Memecoins make for great press, but traditional financial institutions are focused on how crypto creates efficiency and transparency in a way that unlocks new value. That value has long been inaccessible but on blockchain rails... everything changes." Utility is an important aspect of attracting people to crypto and creating new revenue channels for on-chain companies. The other important aspect is ensuring safety for retail investors, especially after the $1.4 billion Bybit hack. According to a CertiK report, there were 760 security breaches with $2.36 billion lost in 2024, a sharp 31 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise. These vulnerabilities expose the risk of investors within the crypto industry and the need to build highly secure crypto products. CertiK co-founder and ceo, Professor Ronghui Gu commented, “Hackers are using increasingly sophisticated techniques, and it is now more important than ever for blockchain businesses and projects to proactively invest in robust security measures. The Bybit breach is a wake-up call for the entire industry. Security is not simply a competitive edge - it is a shared responsibility." Mooly Sagiv, CEO and co-founder of Certora, explained, “As the crypto industry matures, hackers will find more sophisticated ways to siphon off funds. The onus lies with companies to develop safer products for users. Incidents like the Bybit hack erode investor confidence, and stakeholders must take all necessary precautions to initiate a trust-building exercise.” As the speculative frenzy settles down for a while, companies have the window to focus on building safe crypto products with real use cases. VCs have been doing this for a long time and continue to do so during market volatility. NFTs and the metaverse didn’t feature among the popular crypto narratives of 2024 in any dimension including mindshare. They were remnants of the past crypto bull market cycle, forgotten amidst memecoins and the AI token frenzy. Yet, according to a Galaxy report, VCs invested the largest share of capital in categories like NFTs, metaverse, and gaming in Q4 2024. The reality is that people like to gamble, play the lottery, and enjoy gaming. These multi-billion dollar U.S. industries, $65 billion, $100 billion, and over $100 billion annually respectively, are growing (globally), and in many instances, and are being transformed by Web3 technologies. It is an important point to bring to attention, especially as it relates to technology innovation and investment where gaming is a leading category of VC investment. VCs often don’t follow a mindshare-based investing strategy. Instead, they identify categories with immense potential and invest early to reap dividends when the industry matures. For instance, in Q4 2024, the majority of capital for NFTs, DAOs, and metaverse went to early-stage companies and projects. According to Ronald Yung from RaveDAO, “NFTs were once perceived primarily as digital collectibles or icons of the last bull cycle, but their real value lies in their evolving utility. At RaveDAO, we’ve integrated NFTs beyond art—leveraging them for event ticketing as proof of attendance and participation. “While the market sentiment around NFTs has shifted, the underlying technology remains a powerful tool for authentication, access control, and community engagement. The solution itself isn’t going anywhere — it’s simply adapting to real-world applications.” Similarly, VCs had identified AI’s transformative potential long before ChatGPT became a household name, and AI tokens dominated investor mindshare. AI funding has grown steadily from just $670 million in 2011 to $36 billion in 2020. VC capital inflows into emerging tech remain strong. In Q1 2025, AI funding outpaced crypto venture funding by a huge margin, continuing a historically preferential investment trend. Although the traditional AI space attracts more funds, blockchain-based AI startups have also started getting capital investments recently. Rowan Stone, CEO of Sapien, said, “There’s still an enormous gap between legacy AI and crypto-AI investments, with institutional capital favoring the former, but bringing together two emerging categories, like crypto and AI to build frontier consumer-focused tech will likely drive more revenue growth and attract new investments. “There’s more we can accomplish to build a smart AI-driven global ecosystem if we continue to develop good products within the crypto-AI sub-domain.” The investment patterns show that VCs have identified more “future-proof” segments and deployed capital accordingly for long-term market growth. The Trump administration’s assurance that the American economy will experience a transitory period is a promise greatly supported by America’s leading Technology and Information sector. The Technology and Information sector is the third largest U.S. services sector and contributes around 10 percent of GDP (~$2.4 trillion), behind the second, Healthcare & Social Assistance – around 18 percent of GDP (~$4.5 trillion), and the number one services sector leader, Financial Services, which contributes around 20 percent of GDP (~$5 trillion) - the U.S. is the home of the global capital markets. The American market boom is anything but over for the Financial Services sector, according to Larry Fink, the chairman and ceo of Blackrock, in his Annual Report. In fact, it’s just getting started. Historically, markets in transition always presented enormous scope for innovation. The ongoing market transition also provides a good reminder to strive for innovation without getting distracted by daily stock market moves. Warren Buffet, arguably history’s most successful fundamental investor, advises us to, “Remember that the stock market is a manic depressive.” In a recent CNBC interview, he said "When valuations swing wildly, always focus on the underlying quality — opportunities abound in the chaos." Always stay rational.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have dropped after U.S. president Donald Trump followed through with his threatened "Liberation Day" of global trade tariffs—dropping an “atomic bomb” on markets. The bitcoin price has fallen back after climbing in the run up to Trump’s tariff announcement as traders scramble to parse the so-called reciprocal tariffs (and stay ahead of a serious new threat). Now, as the chief executive of BlackRock warns bitcoin could end the U.S. dollar’s world’s reserve currency status, traders are betting the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to stave off a U.S. recession—something that could see the market “flooded” with dollars. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is having to recalculate the need for interest rate cuts after ... More U.S. president Donald Trump followed though on his threat of global trade tariffs—potentially playing havoc with the bitcoin price. Short-term interest-rate futures are showing a 70% chance of a Fed interest rate cut when it meets in June, up from about 60% before the tariffs were announced. Recession fears have seen traders have boost bets the Fed will restart its interest rate cutting cycle this summer and deliver a total of three quarter-point reductions to the policy rate by October, it was reported by Reuters. Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” barrage of trade tariffs have pushed the probability of a U.S. recession to over 50% on prediction markets Polymarket and Kalshi. "Remember—tariffs are dovish, and big tariffs are very dovish," Joseph Wang, operator of the research portal Fedguy.com posted to X. In a closely-watched Wednesday announcement, Trump slapped 10% tariffs on most goods imported to the U.S., as well as even higher duties on dozens of countries. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped as Donald Trump sparks fears of recession and the Federal Reserve ... More suspends its planned interest rate cutting cycle. Last September, the Fed’s surprise 50 basis point interest rate cut helped kick off the bitcoin price rally that fed into Donald Trump’s election victory in November. “I still believe bitcoin can hit $250,000 by year-end because now that the [U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent] has put [Fed chair Jerome] Powell in his place, the Fed will flood the market with dollars,” Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex, wrote in a blog post. “If my analysis of the Fed’s major pivot from quantitive tightening to quantitive easing for treasuries is correct, then bitcoin hit a local low of $76,500 last month, and now we begin the ascent to $250,000 by year-end. Of course, this is not an exact science, but using the gold example, if I had to place a bet on whether I thought bitcoin would hit $76,500 or $110,000 first, I would bet on the latter.” Last month, Powell warned the risk of recession is rising—something BlackRock’s head of bitcoin and crypto has predicted could be a “big catalyst” for the bitcoin price.

Title: Stocks tumble after Trump's tariff reveal, with Dow set to shed 1,000 points

Markets plummeted Thursday in the wake of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1,679.39 points, or 4%, with the damage extending to most industries on the prospects of stagflation — that is, slower economic growth accompanied by faster inflation. The S&P 500 plunged 4.8% and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 6%, making Thursday the market’s worst day for stocks in five years. Airlines, retailers and big banks took big hits, with some healthcare companies among the few gainers. For the Magnificent 7, declines were 9.3% for Apple (AAPL-5.92%), 9% for Amazon (AMZN-0.99%), 9% for Meta (META-3.35%), 5.5% for Tesla (TSLA-8.68%), 7.8% for Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%), 2.4% for Microsoft (MSFT-2.15%), and 3.9% for Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL-1.04%). Big Tech will be vulnerable to retaliation by the European Union. “Trump’s tariff plan probably represents a shift for markets to quickly move from max uncertainty to max pessimism, although if countries retaliate — and Europe and China are talking like they will — rates could go up even further and drive another leg down for markets,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial (LPLA-8.46%). Buchbinder expects stocks to stabilize provided negotiations bear fruit and take tariff rates down, assuming markets are assured that no meaningful tariff rates will be increased because of retaliation, he wrote in an email distributed to the media. Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%), isn’t so sanguine as she expects the levies to actually go into effect as announced. “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk,” she told Quartz on Wednesday after the news. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” Trump showed no signs of backing down on Thursday, saying, “It’s going very well,” comparing the imposition of tariffs to surgery, and claiming “the markets are going to boom” along with the country. The president’s early claims that the import taxes will bring back jobs is debatable, and duties have a poor historical track record of boosting manufacturing employment. The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the EU will be slapped with 20%. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%, respectively. The large tariffs on Asian countries will weigh heavily on shoe and apparel makers, which do much of their manufacturing in the region. Shares of Nike (NKE+5.51%) plunged 14%, while those of Lululemon (LULU+5.73%) plummeted 9.6%, and those of Uggs- and Hoka-maker Deckers (DECK+6.95%) tumbled 14%. Restoration Hardware’s parent RH (RH-0.83%) tumbled 40% on Thursday on a double whammy of earnings and tariffs. Williams-Sonoma (WSM+4.03%) plunged 16%, and at the other end of the retail spectrum Dollar Tree (DLTR+2.24%) fell 13%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. General Motors (GM-3.10%), Ford (F+1.26%) and Stellantis (STLA-4.11%) nonetheless extended their declines — by 4.3%, 5.9% and 9.4%, respectively — as Canada retaliated in kind for Trump’s new 25% tariffs on cars and trucks. “The tariff announcement was intended to give clarity on tariff policy,” Art Wheaton, an auto industry expert at Cornell University, said via an email sent to the media. “Unfortunately, it has created more questions and confusion.” Stellantis has already suspended plants in Canada and Mexico, he added. Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free from China. The shares of PDD (PDD-9.13%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.5%. The the stock market — and the economy — isn’t certain to get help from the Federal Reserve in the form of an interest rate cut, given that the import taxes will probably both boost inflation and weigh on GDP growth. Economists are divided on whether the central bank will prioritize prices or full employment. Economic data was mixed on Thursday. Initial jobless claims for the week through March 29 unexpectedly declined to 219,000 from un upwardly revised 225,000, but the continuing claims for the seven days to March 22 increased by more than estimated, to 1.90 million.The ISM services purchasing managers index (PMI) ticked down by more than expected. Yardeni Research projected that PCED inflation will accelerate to 3% to 4% over the rest of this year, with the potential for a quick deterioration of the labor market. If stagflation sets in, the firm expects it to last six months to a year. “The worst-case scenario is a recession if high tariff rates stick, leading to a slowdown in business and consumer spending that cause layoffs,” the firm wrote in a QuickTakes note. “We raised our odds of a stagflation/recession scenario from 35% to 45% on Monday.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: How and where Trump's new tariffs affect Apple

AAPL: 186.60 ( 16.59 ) Copyright © 2025 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. Donald Trump's signed tariff plan - Photo credit CNBC Last updated 1 day ago President Trump's new tariffs go far beyond China, and hit every nation in the world. Here's how badly Apple has been hit, and where it has been struck globally. In February 2025, the Bank of America said that the impact of tariffs on Apple would be significant. Before the extent of the tariffs were announced, Bank of America estimated that they would mean Apple may have to raise iPhone prices by 10%. Apple has yet to make any announcements about price changes. It might have attempted to swallow small increases in component costs, but it is unlikely to absorb these massive ones. The company has previously made a point of how it has kept the iPhone costs the same for years — although only in the US. That means it has borne at least some inflation costs mostly because of smart buys of commodities like DRAM and NAND, and also any added expense of new technologies being added to the iPhone. But those costs will continue to rise anyway, and the addition of tariffs may mean even Apple cannot avoid raising its prices. Previously Apple was able to negotiate a tariff exemption during President Trump's first term, but as yet it has failed to do so again. So at present, Apple will have to pay the tariffs on everything it imports into the US. And, there is some double-dipping involved, perhaps. An iPad assembled in Vietnam will also incur a cost for having a processor manufactured in Taiwan. It should be clear that a TSMC processor made in Arizona would face no tariff, but materials imported to make those chips will be impacted. And, for now, it appears those chips are completed in TSMC's facilities in Taiwan, at least until the AMKOR finishing plant comes completely on line. Taking each country's tariffs separately, though, this is what CNBC says Apple now has to pay for devices or components from each of its biggest supply regions. ChinaChina currently accounts for: 80% of Apple's whole production capacity Assembly of 90% of all iPhones Assembly of 55% of Macs Assembly of 80% of iPads Overall, it's estimated that around 40% of all of Apple's suppliers are based in China. Tariffs that Apple will have to pay to import goods from these suppliers are immediately set to 34%. IndiaCurrently India assembles approximately 10% to 15% of iPhones, but has been expected to reach up to 20% by the end of 2025, helped by the country cutting import taxes for Apple and others. Apple is now required to pay a tariff of 26% on imports from India. VietnamVietnam has benefited from an increase in investment from Apple, partly to avoid the expected tariffs, and partly to avoid overall US/China trade tensions. It has also been intended to reduce Apple's over-dependence on China as a single supply source. Now, however, Apple will have to pay an import tariff of 46%. This will affect: Assembly of 20% of iPads Assembly of 90% of Apple Watch Other major countriesApple produces some Macs in Thailand, which now has a 36% tariff. Malaysia also manufacturers the Mac, and is facing a 25% tariff. The vast majority of processors in all Apple devices, though, are manufactured by Taiwan's TSMC. And imports to the US from Taiwan now have a 32% tariff. The impact on Apple, and market sentimentAnalysts are starting to chime in on what they expect to see from these tariffs. Krish Sankar from TD Cowen believes that US sales account for about 31% of total revenues with about 75% coming from hardware products. He estimates that every 10% of tariffs would impact Apple's net income by about 3.5% in FY25 and FY26 EPS. He also estimates that Apple will raise prices to offset tariffs, and estimates that every 10% of tariffs levied can be offset by an about 6% increase in product average selling price. Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan has also come up with the 6% figure. Analyst Daniel Ives from Wedbush calls the tariff plan "illogical," and "economic Armageddon" for the global economy, and specifically, the American consumer. Ives reiterates that when other countries are hit with tariffs, it's ultimately the American consumer that bears the entire brunt of the bill. He still considers Apple a focus to own in a stock portfolio, but is expecting to see at least in the short term a 10% hit. Trump's new tariffs immediately caused stocks in technology firms to fall. Apple saw the largest drop of any technology firm. Apple's stocks fell almost 7.5% in extended trading as of 8 AM Eastern Time on April 3. It's not clear what the market sentiment will be when the market opens. In comparison, Nvidia's shares dropped 4%, while Tesla lost approximately 4.5%. Amazon, Meta, and Google parent company Alphabet all lost between 2.5% and 5%, while Microsoft is down almost 2%. Unless Apple stocks rebound during regular trading, this fall is the company's worst since September 2020. That was when the iPhone 12 launch was delayed because of COVID disruption.

So much for a certain person donating a cool million to a certain persons fund and being welcomed into the "tent" and kissing the ring. Looks like T.C got the short end of the stick even with TSMC build a fab for processors.

If Apple meets in the middle and absorbs half the tariff say 15-20% won’t it only be an impact of like 6-7% on eps? Doesn’t the US hardware account for only 20% of eps?

Didn't president "bone spurs" kill the CHIPS act signed by Biden that was to bring some microprocessor manufacturing back to the US?Is that plant still going on line in Arizona?Edit: Forget my question about the plant in Arizona. It's already on line as stated by Appleinsider back in January 8. Malcolm Owen's article --> TSMC's Arizona plant starts making a second Apple chip Didn't president "bone spurs" kill the CHIPS act signed by Biden that was to bring some microprocessor manufacturing back to the US? Maybe I’m missing something but Tim meeting with Trump and in Feb and then both announcing the 500b US investment has total exemption written all over it. Again am I missing something? Would welcome comments. Maybe I’m missing something but Tim meeting with Trump and in Feb and then both announcing the 500b US investment has total exemption written all over it. Again am I missing something? Would welcome comments. A Japanese chipmaker you've probably never heard of wants to power Apple's future artificial intelligence server farms. President Trump has pushed back TikTok's ban date again, saying that his administration has made "tremendous progress" on a deal to "save TikTok." Apple's iconic iPhone may soon cost you about double what it costs now, as analysts predict a 43% price increase in response to U.S. tariffs on imports from China and elsewhere in the world. Investment bank Morgan Stanley has told investors that while Apple may have brought forward some iPhone 16 production ahead of Trump's new tariffs, there is little more it can do to mitigate a $33 billion cost increase it is about to incur. One of Apple's most controversial stores never opened, but a virtual tour that can be viewed on Apple Vision Pro brings the dream back to life. President Trump's announcement of tariffs and retaliatory measures by China has seen Apple's shares drop to their lowest point since June 2024, as investors predict rising iPhone prices and falling sales. Windows users who have an Apple Music subscription can now enjoy immersive, three-dimensional audio thanks to newly added support for Dolby Atmos on the Apple Music app. Now that iOS 18.4 is out, we're looking to the future with iOS 18.5, a rumored AI update to Apple Health, and the first rumors about the M6 processor, all on the AppleInsider Podcast. Apple and Michigan State University are opening a free manufacturing training academy in Detroit to help U.S. suppliers modernize their operations. Ming-Chi Kuo's Apple commentary is normally fairly insightful, but his latest batch on how Apple can shoulder President Trump's tariff burden is short-sighted, and doesn't make a great deal of sense. The Keychron Q3 HE is a great compact mechanical keyboard, one that offers lots of customization thanks to its Hall Effect switches.

Investors weren’t happy with President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, sending stocks plunging. The S&P 500 fell 4% at 10:14 a.m., the Nasdaq composite declined 5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 3.7%, or 1,556 points. For the Magnificent 7, declines in pre-market trading were 7.5% for Apple (AAPL-5.92%), 6.3% for Amazon (AMZN-0.99%), 4.7% for Meta (META-3.35%), 6.1% for Tesla (TSLA-8.68%), 5.7% for Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%), 2.8% for Microsoft (MSFT-2.15%), and 3% for Google’s (GOOGL-1.04%) parent Alphabet. The import taxes will be applied on a country-by-country basis. Chinese goods, for example, will be hit with a 34% levy, while products from the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties. Mexican and Canadian goods won’t face any additional charges. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Melisa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%), told Quartz. The tariffs are “not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but could be very harmful for pockets of it.” Economic data was mixed on Thursday. Initial jobless claims for the week through March 29 unexpectedly declined to 219,000 from un upwardly revised 225,000, but the continuing claims for the seven days to March 22 increased by more than estimated, to 1.90 million. The ISM services purchasing managers index (PMI) ticked down by much more than expected for March to 50.8 from 53.5 in February, with the new orders measure dropping to 50.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. More stocks to watch today: Constellation Brands (STZ-3.05%), which makes, imports and distributes alcoholic beverages, is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Thursday. Revenue and per-share profit may have been little changed from a year earlier. The stock fell 0.6%. General Motors (GM-3.10%) stock dropped 3% after Trump confirmed that 25% duties on cars, trucks and autoparts will go into place as planned. Stellantis (STLA-4.11%) fell 5.1%, and Ford (F+1.26%) slid 2.7%. Trump had announced the auto tariffs earlier, and refrained from imposing additional tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Nike’s (NKE+5.51%) stock plunged 13% because the shoemaker’s contract factories abroad in countries including Vietnam and China will face much higher tariffs. Apparel maker Lululemon (LULU+5.73%) and Deckers (DECK+6.95%) Outdoor, which makes the Hoka and Teva brands, fell 13% and 17%, respectively for the same reason. PDD (PDD-9.13%) stock fell 4.3%. The company’s Temu shopping website will be affected by the end of the de minimis exemption that allows low-value packages to be sent from China duty free.

Our monetary policy strategy, the tools we use and the impact they have Insights into our work on financial stability and payments and market infrastructures Access to all ECB statistics and background information All you need to know about our common currency In-depth studies and expert analyses covering diverse topics and fields 3 April 2025 Ms Schnabel started her presentation by noting that, since the Governing Council's previous monetary policy meeting on 29-30 January 2025, euro area and US markets had moved in opposite directions in a highly volatile political environment. In the euro area, markets had focused on the near-term macroeconomic backdrop, with incoming data in the euro area surprising on the upside. Lower energy prices responding in part to the prospect of a ceasefire in Ukraine, looser fiscal policy due to increased defence spending and a potential relaxation of Germany’s fiscal rules had supported investor sentiment. This contrasted with developments in the United States, where market participants’ assessment of the new US Administration’s policy decisions had turned more negative amid fears of tariffs driving prices up and dampening consumer and business sentiment. A puzzling feature of recent market developments had been the dichotomy between measures of policy uncertainty and financial market volatility. Global economic policy uncertainty had shot up in the final quarter of 2024 and had reached a new all-time high, surpassing the peak seen at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. By contrast, volatility in euro area and US equity markets had remained muted, despite having broadly traced dynamics in economic policy uncertainty over the past 15 years. Only more recently, with the prospect of tariffs becoming more concrete, had stock market volatility started to pick up from low levels. Risk sentiment in the euro area remained strong and close to all-time highs, outpacing the United States, which had declined significantly since the Governing Council's January monetary policy meeting. This mirrored the divergence of macroeconomic developments. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the euro area had turned positive in February 2025, reaching its highest level since April 2024. This was in contrast to developments in the United States, where economic surprises had been negative recently. The divergence in investor appetite was most evident in stock markets. The euro area stock market continued to outperform its US counterpart, posting the strongest year-to-date performance relative to the US index in almost a decade. Stock market developments were aligned with analysts’ earnings expectations, which had been raised for European firms since the start of 2025. Meanwhile, US earnings estimates had been revised down continuously for the past eleven weeks. Part of the recent outperformance of euro area equities stemmed from a catch-up in valuations given that euro area equities had performed less strongly than US stocks in 2024. Moreover, in spite of looming tariffs, the euro area equity market was benefiting from potential growth tailwinds, including a possible ceasefire in Ukraine, the greater prospect of a stable German government following the country’s parliamentary elections and the likelihood of increased defence spending in the euro area. The share prices of tariff-sensitive companies had been significantly underperforming their respective benchmarks in both currency areas, but tariff-sensitive stocks in the United States had fared substantially worse. Market pricing also indicated a growing divergence in inflation prospects between the euro area and the United States. In the euro area, the market’s view of a gradual disinflation towards the ECB’s 2% target remained intact. One-year forward inflation compensation one year ahead stood at around 2%, while the one-year forward inflation-linked swap rate one year ahead continued to stand somewhat below 2%. However, inflation compensation had moved up across maturities on 5 March 2025. In the United States, one-year forward inflation compensation one year ahead had increased significantly, likely driven in part by bond traders pricing in the inflationary effects of tariffs on US consumer prices. Indicators of the balance of risks for inflation suggested that financial market participants continued to see inflation risks in the euro area as broadly balanced across maturities. Changing growth and inflation prospects had also been reflected in monetary policy expectations for the euro area. On the back of slightly lower inflation compensation due to lower energy prices, expectations for ECB monetary policy had edged down. A 25 basis point cut was fully priced in for the current Governing Council monetary policy meeting, while markets saw a further rate cut at the following meeting as uncertain. Most recently, at the time of the meeting, rate investors no longer expected three more 25 basis point cuts in the deposit facility rate in 2025. Participants in the Survey of Monetary Analysts, finalised in the last week of February, had continued to expect a slightly faster easing cycle. Turning to euro area market interest rates, the rise in nominal ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rates since the 11-12 December 2024 Governing Council meeting had largely been driven by improving euro area macroeconomic data, while the impact of US factors had been small overall. Looking back, euro area ten-year nominal and real OIS rates had overall been remarkably stable since their massive repricing in 2022, when the ECB had embarked on the hiking cycle. A key driver of persistently higher long-term rates had been the market’s reassessment of the real short-term rate that was expected to prevail in the future. The expected real one-year forward rate four years ahead had surged in 2022 as investors adjusted their expectations away from a “low-for-long” interest rate environment, suggesting that higher real rates were expected to be the new normal. The strong risk sentiment had also been transmitted to euro area sovereign bond spreads relative to yields on German government bonds, which remained at contained levels. Relative to OIS rates, however, the spreads had increased since the January monetary policy meeting – this upward move intensified on 5 March with the expectation of a substantial increase in defence spending. One factor behind the gradual widening of asset swap spreads over the past two years had been the increasing net supply of government bonds, which had been smoothly absorbed in the market. Regarding the exchange rate, after a temporary depreciation the euro had appreciated slightly against the US dollar, going above the level seen at the time of the January meeting. While the repricing of expectations regarding ECB monetary policy relative to the United States had weighed on the euro, as had global risk sentiment, the euro had been supported by the relatively stronger euro area economic outlook. Ms Schnabel then considered the implications of recent market developments for overall financial conditions. Since the Governing Council's previous monetary policy meeting, a broad-based and pronounced easing in financial conditions had been observed. This was driven primarily by higher equity prices and, to a lesser extent, by lower interest rates. The decline in euro area real risk-free interest rates across the yield curve implied that the euro area real yield curve remained well within neutral territory. Mr Lane started his introduction by noting that, according to Eurostat’s flash release, headline inflation in the euro area had declined to 2.4% in February, from 2.5% in January. While energy inflation had fallen from 1.9% to 0.2% and services inflation had eased from 3.9% to 3.7%, food inflation had increased to 2.7%, from 2.3%, and non-energy industrial goods inflation had edged up from 0.5% to 0.6%. Most indicators of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. The Persistent and Common Component of Inflation had ticked down to 2.1% in January. Domestic inflation, which closely tracked services inflation, had declined by 0.2 percentage points to 4.0%. But it remained high, as wages and some services prices were still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. Recent wage negotiations pointed to a continued moderation in labour cost pressures. For instance, negotiated wage growth had decreased to 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The wage tracker and an array of survey indicators also suggested a continued weakening of wage pressures in 2025. Inflation was expected to evolve along a slightly higher path in 2025 than had been expected in the Eurosystem staff’s December projections, owing to higher energy prices. At the same time, services inflation was expected to continue declining in early 2025 as the effects from lagged repricing faded, wage pressures receded and the impact of past monetary policy tightening continued to feed through. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations still stood at around 2%. Near-term market-based inflation compensation had declined across maturities, likely reflecting the most recent decline in energy prices, but longer-term inflation compensation had recently increased in response to emerging fiscal developments. Consumer inflation expectations had resumed their downward momentum in January. According to the March ECB staff projections, headline inflation was expected to average 2.3% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027. Compared with the December 2024 projections, inflation had been revised up by 0.2 percentage points for 2025, reflecting stronger energy price dynamics in the near term. At the same time, the projections were unchanged for 2026 and had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2027. For core inflation, staff projected a slowdown from an average of 2.2% in 2025 to 2.0% in 2026 and to 1.9% in 2027 as labour cost pressures eased further, the impact of past shocks faded and the past monetary policy tightening continued to weigh on prices. The core inflation projection was 0.1 percentage points lower for 2025 compared with the December projections round, as recent data releases had surprised on the downside, but they had been revised up by the same amount for 2026, reflecting the lagged indirect effects of the past depreciation of the euro as well as higher energy inflation in 2025. Geopolitical uncertainties loomed over the global growth outlook. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for global composite output excluding the euro area had declined in January to 52.0, amid a broad-based slowdown in the services sector across key economies. The discussions between the United States and Russia over a possible ceasefire in Ukraine, as well as the de-escalation in the Middle East, had likely contributed to the recent decline in oil and gas prices on global commodity markets. Nevertheless, geopolitical tensions remained a major source of uncertainty. Euro area foreign demand growth was projected to moderate, declining from 3.4% in 2024 to 3.2% in 2025 and then to 3.1% in 2026 and 2027. Downward revisions to the projections for global trade compared with the December 2024 projections reflected mostly the impact of tariffs on US imports from China. The euro had remained stable in nominal effective terms and had appreciated against the US dollar since the last monetary policy meeting. From the start of the easing cycle last summer, the euro had depreciated overall both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms, albeit showing a lot of volatility in the high frequency data. Energy commodity prices had decreased following the January meeting, with oil prices down by 4.6% and gas prices down by 12%. However, energy markets had also seen a lot of volatility recently. Turning to activity in the euro area, GDP had grown modestly in the fourth quarter of 2024. Manufacturing was still a drag on growth, as industrial activity remained weak in the winter months and stood below its third-quarter level. At the same time, survey indicators for manufacturing had been improving and indicators for activity in the services sector were moderating, while remaining in expansionary territory. Although growth in domestic demand had slowed in the fourth quarter, it remained clearly positive. In contrast, exports had likely continued to contract in the fourth quarter. Survey data pointed to modest growth momentum in the first quarter of 2025. The composite output PMI had stood at 50.2 in February, unchanged from January and up from an average of 49.3 in the fourth quarter of 2024. The PMI for manufacturing output had risen to a nine-month high of 48.9, whereas the PMI for services business activity had been 50.6, remaining in expansionary territory but at its lowest level for a year. The more forward-looking composite PMI for new orders had edged down slightly in February owing to its services component. The European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator had improved in January and February but remained well below its long-term average. The labour market remained robust. Employment had increased by 0.1 percentage points in the fourth quarter and the unemployment rate had stayed at its historical low of 6.2% in January. However, demand for labour had moderated, which was reflected in fewer job postings, fewer job-to-job transitions and declining quit intentions for wage or career reasons. Recent survey data suggested that employment growth had been subdued in the first two months of 2025. In terms of fiscal policy, a tightening of 0.9 percentage points of GDP had been achieved in 2024, mainly because of the reversal of inflation compensatory measures and subsidies. In the March projections a further slight tightening was foreseen for 2025, but this did not yet factor in the news received earlier in the week about the scaling-up of defence spending. Looking ahead, growth should be supported by higher incomes and lower borrowing costs. According to the staff projections, exports should also be boosted by rising global demand as long as trade tensions did not escalate further. But uncertainty had increased and was likely to weigh on investment and exports more than previously expected. Consequently, ECB staff had again revised down growth projections, by 0.2 percentage points to 0.9% for 2025 and by 0.2 percentage points to 1.2% for 2026, while keeping the projection for 2027 unchanged at 1.3%. Respondents to the Survey of Monetary Analysts expected growth of 0.8% in 2025, 0.2 percentage points lower than in January, but continued to expect growth of 1.1% in 2026 and 1.2% in 2027, unchanged from January. Market interest rates in the euro area had decreased after the January meeting but had risen over recent days in response to the latest fiscal developments. The past interest rate cuts, together with anticipated future cuts, were making new borrowing less expensive for firms and households, and loan growth was picking up. At the same time, a headwind to the easing of financing conditions was coming from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to the stock of credit, and lending remained subdued overall. The cost of new loans to firms had declined further by 12 basis points to 4.2% in January, about 1 percentage point below the October 2023 peak. By contrast, the cost of issuing market-based corporate debt had risen to 3.7%, 0.2 percentage points higher than in December. Mortgage rates were 14 basis points lower at 3.3% in January, around 80 basis points below their November 2023 peak. However, the average cost of bank credit measured on the outstanding stock of loans had declined substantially less than that of new loans to firms and only marginally for mortgages. Annual growth in bank lending to firms had risen to 2.0% in January, up from 1.7% in December. This had mainly reflected base effects, as the negative flow in January 2024 had dropped out of the annual calculation. Corporate debt issuance had increased in January in terms of the monthly flow, but the annual growth rate had remained broadly stable at 3.4%. Mortgage lending had continued its gradual rise, with an annual growth rate of 1.3% in January after 1.1% in December. In summary, the disinflation process remained well on track. Inflation had continued to develop broadly as staff expected, and the latest projections closely aligned with the previous inflation outlook. Most measures of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. Wage growth was moderating as expected. The recent interest rate cuts were making new borrowing less expensive and loan growth was picking up. At the same time, past interest rate hikes were still transmitting to the stock of credit and lending remained subdued overall. The economy faced continued headwinds, reflecting lower exports and ongoing weakness in investment, in part originating from high trade policy uncertainty as well as broader policy uncertainty. Rising real incomes and the gradually fading effects of past rate hikes continued to be the key drivers underpinning the expected pick-up in demand over time. Based on this assessment, Mr Lane proposed lowering the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In particular, the proposal to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steered the monetary policy stance – was rooted in the updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Moving the deposit facility rate from 2.75% to 2.50% would be a robust decision. In particular, holding at 2.75% could weaken the required recovery in consumption and investment and thereby risk undershooting the inflation target in the medium term. Furthermore, the new projections indicated that, if the baseline dynamics for inflation and economic growth continued to hold, further easing would be required to stabilise inflation at the medium-term target on a sustainable basis. Under this baseline, from a macroeconomic perspective, a variety of rate paths over the coming meetings could deliver the remaining degree of easing. This reinforced the value of a meeting-by-meeting approach, with no pre-commitment to any particular rate path. In the near term, it would allow the Governing Council to take into account all the incoming data between the current meeting and the meeting on 16-17 April, together with the latest waves of the ECB’s surveys, including the bank lending survey, the Corporate Telephone Survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Consumer Expectations Survey. Moreover, the Governing Council should pay special attention to the unfolding geopolitical risks and emerging fiscal developments in view of their implications for activity and inflation. In particular, compared with the rate paths consistent with the baseline projection, the appropriate rate path at future meetings would also reflect the evolution and/or materialisation of the upside and downside risks to inflation and economic momentum. As the Governing Council had advanced further in the process of lowering rates from their peak, the communication about the state of transmission in the monetary policy statement should evolve. Mr Lane proposed replacing the “level” assessment that “monetary policy remains restrictive” with the more “directional” statement that “our monetary policy is becoming meaningfully less restrictive”. In a similar vein, the Governing Council should replace the reference “financing conditions continue to be tight” with an acknowledgement that “a headwind to the easing of financing conditions comes from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to the stock of credit, and lending remains subdued overall”. As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane. Global activity at the end of 2024 had been marginally stronger than expected (possibly supported by firms frontloading imports of foreign inputs ahead of potential trade disruptions) and according to the March 2025 ECB staff projections global growth was expected to remain fairly solid overall, while moderating slightly over 2025-27. This moderation came mainly from expected lower growth rates for the United States and China, which were partially compensated for by upward revisions to the outlook for other economies. Euro area foreign demand was seen to evolve broadly in line with global activity over the rest of the projection horizon. Compared with the December 2024 Eurosystem staff projections, foreign demand was projected to be slightly weaker over 2025-27. This weakness was seen to stem mainly from lower US imports. Recent data in the United States had come in on the soft side. It was highlighted that the March 2025 projections only incorporated tariffs implemented at the time of the cut-off date (namely US tariffs of 10% on imports from China and corresponding retaliatory tariffs on US exports to China). By contrast, US tariffs that had been suspended or not yet formally announced at the time of the cut-off date were treated as risks to the baseline projections. Elevated and exceptional uncertainty was highlighted as a key theme for both the external environment and the euro area economy. Current uncertainties were seen as multidimensional (political, geopolitical, tariff-related and fiscal) and as comprising “radical” or “Knightian” elements, in other words a type of uncertainty that could not be quantified or captured well by standard tools and quantitative analysis. In particular, the unpredictable patterns of trade protectionism in the United States were currently having an impact on the outlook for the global economy and might also represent a more lasting regime change. It was also highlighted that, aside from specific, already enacted tariff measures, uncertainty surrounding possible additional measures was creating significant extra headwinds in the global economy. The impact of US tariffs on trading partners was seen to be clearly negative for activity while being more ambiguous for inflation. For the latter, an upside effect in the short term, partly driven by the exchange rate, might be broadly counterbalanced by downside pressures on prices from lower demand, especially over the medium term. It was underlined that it was challenging to determine, ex ante, the impact of protectionist measures, as this would depend crucially on how the measures were deployed and was likely to be state and scale-dependent, in particular varying with the duration of the protectionist measures and the extent of any retaliatory measures. More generally, a tariff could be seen as a tax on production and consumption, which also involved a wealth transfer from the private to the public sector. In this context, it was underlined that tariffs were generating welfare losses for all parties concerned. With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane. The overall narrative remained that the economy continued to grow, but in a modest way. Based on Eurostat’s flash release for the euro area (of 14 February) and available country data, year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 appeared broadly in line with what had been expected. However, the composition was somewhat different, with more private and government consumption, less investment and deeply negative net exports. It was mentioned that recent surveys had been encouraging, pointing to a turnaround in the interest rate-sensitive manufacturing sector, with the euro area manufacturing PMI reaching its highest level in 24 months. While developments in services continued to be better than those in manufacturing, survey evidence suggested that momentum in the services sector could be slowing, although manufacturing might become less negative – a pattern of rotation also seen in surveys of the global economy. Elevated uncertainty was undoubtedly a factor holding back firms’ investment spending. Exports were also weak, particularly for capital goods.The labour market remained resilient, however. The unemployment rate in January (6.2%) was at a historical low for the euro area economy, once again better than expected, although the positive momentum in terms of the rate of employment growth appeared to be moderating. While the euro area economy was still expected to grow in the first quarter of the year, it was noted that incoming data were mixed. Current and forward-looking indicators were becoming less negative for the manufacturing sector but less positive for the services sector. Consumer confidence had ticked up in the first two months of 2025, albeit from low levels, while households’ unemployment expectations had also improved slightly. Regarding investment, there had been some improvement in housing investment indicators, with the housing output PMI having improved measurably, thus indicating a bottoming-out in the housing market, and although business investment indicators remained negative, they were somewhat less so. Looking ahead, economic growth should continue and strengthen over time, although once again more slowly than previously expected. Real wage developments and more affordable credit should support household spending. The outlook for investment and exports remained the most uncertain because it was clouded by trade policy and geopolitical uncertainties. Broad agreement was expressed with the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections. Economic growth was expected to continue, albeit at a modest pace and somewhat slower than previously expected. It was noted, however, that the downward revision to economic growth in 2025 was driven in part by carry-over effects from a weak fourth quarter in 2024 (according to Eurostat’s flash release). Some concern was raised that the latest downward revisions to the current projections had come after a sequence of downward revisions. Moreover, other institutions’ forecasts appeared to be notably more pessimistic. While these successive downward revisions to the staff projections had been modest on an individual basis, cumulatively they were considered substantial. At the same time, it was highlighted that negative judgement had been applied to the March projections, notably on investment and net exports among the demand components. By contrast, there had been no significant change in the expected outlook for private consumption, which, supported by real wage growth, accumulated savings and lower interest rates, was expected to remain the main element underpinning growth in economic activity. While there were some downward revisions to expectations for government consumption, investment and exports, the outlook for each of these components was considered to be subject to heightened uncertainty. Regarding government consumption, recent discussions in the fiscal domain could mean that the slowdown in growth rates of government spending in 2025 assumed in the projections might not materialise after all. These new developments could pose risks to the projections, as they would have an impact on economic growth, inflation and possibly also potential growth, countering the structural weakness observed so far. At the same time, it was noted that a significant rise in the ten-year yields was already being observed, whereas the extra stimulus from military spending would likely materialise only further down the line. Overall, members considered that the broad narrative of a modestly growing euro area economy remained valid. Developments in US trade policies and elevated uncertainty were weighing on businesses and consumers in the euro area, and hence on the outlook for activity. Private consumption had underpinned euro area growth at the end of 2024. The ongoing increase in real wages, as well as low unemployment, the stabilisation in consumer confidence and saving rates that were still above pre-pandemic levels, provided confidence that a consumption-led recovery was still on track. But some concern was expressed over the extent to which private consumption could further contribute to a pick-up in growth. In this respect, it was argued that moderating real wage growth, which was expected to be lower in 2025 than in 2024, and weak consumer confidence were not promising for a further increase in private consumption. Concerning the behaviour of household savings, it was noted that saving rates were clearly higher than during the pre-pandemic period, although they were projected to decline gradually over the forecast horizon. However, the current heightened uncertainty and the increase in fiscal deficits could imply that higher household savings might persist, partly reflecting “Ricardian” effects (i.e. consumers prone to increase savings in anticipation of higher future taxes needed to service the extra debt). At the same time, it was noted that the modest decline in the saving rate was only one factor supporting the outlook for private consumption. Regarding investment, a distinction was made between housing and business investment. For housing, a slow recovery was forecast during the course of 2025 and beyond. This was based on the premise of lower interest rates and less negative confidence indicators, although some lag in housing investment might be expected owing to planning and permits. The business investment outlook was considered more uncertain. While industrial confidence was low, there had been some improvement in the past couple of months. However, it was noted that confidence among firms producing investment goods was falling and capacity utilisation in the sector was low and declining. It was argued that it was not the level of interest rates that was currently holding back business investment, but a high level of uncertainty about economic policies. In this context, concern was expressed that ongoing uncertainty could result in businesses further delaying investment, which, if cumulated over time, would weigh on the medium-term growth potential. The outlook for exports and the direct and indirect impact of tariff measures were a major concern. It was noted that, as a large exporter, particularly of capital goods, the euro area might feel the biggest impact of such measures. Reference was made to scenario calculations that suggested that there would be a significant negative impact on economic growth, particularly in 2025, if the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and the euro area currently being threatened were actually implemented. Regarding the specific impact on euro area exports, it was noted that, to understand the potential impact on both activity and prices, a granular level of analysis would be required, as sectors differed in terms of competition and pricing power. Which specific goods were targeted would also matter. Furthermore, while imports from the United States (as a percentage of euro area GDP) had increased over the past decade, those from the rest of the world (China, the rest of Asia and other EU countries) were larger and had increased by more. Members overall assessed that the labour market continued to be resilient and was developing broadly in line with previous expectations. The euro area unemployment rate remained at historically low levels and well below estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. The strength of the labour market was seen as attenuating the social cost of the relatively weak economy as well as supporting upside pressures on wages and prices. While there had been some slowdown in employment growth, this also had to be seen in the context of slowing labour force growth. Furthermore, the latest survey indicators suggested a broad stabilisation rather than any acceleration in the slowdown. Overall, the euro area labour market remained tight, with a negative unemployment gap. Against this background, members reiterated that fiscal and structural policies should make the economy more productive, competitive and resilient. It was noted that recent discussions at the national and EU levels raised the prospect of a major change in the fiscal stance, notably in the euro area’s largest economy but also across the European Union. In the baseline projections, which had been finalised before the recent discussions, a fiscal tightening over 2025-27 had been expected owing to a reversal of previous subsidies and termination of the Next Generation EU programme in 2027. Current proposals under discussion at the national and EU levels would represent a substantial change, particularly if additional measures beyond extra defence spending were required to achieve the necessary political buy-in. It was noted, however, that not all countries had sufficient fiscal space. Hence it was underlined that governments should ensure sustainable public finances in line with the EU’s economic governance framework and should prioritise essential growth-enhancing structural reforms and strategic investment. It was also reiterated that the European Commission’s Competitiveness Compass provided a concrete roadmap for action and its proposals should be swiftly adopted. In light of exceptional uncertainty around trade policies and the fiscal outlook, it was noted that one potential impact of elevated uncertainty was that the baseline scenario was becoming less likely to materialise and risk factors might suddenly enter the baseline. Moreover, elevated uncertainty could become a persistent fact of life. It was also considered that the current uncertainty was of a different nature to that normally considered in the projection exercises and regular policymaking. In particular, uncertainty was not so much about how certain variables behaved within the model (or specific model parameters) but whether fundamental building blocks of the models themselves might have to be reconsidered (also given that new phenomena might fall entirely outside the realm of historical data or precedent). This was seen as a call for new approaches to capture uncertainty. Against this background, members assessed that even though some previous downside risks had already materialised, the risks to economic growth had increased and remained tilted to the downside. An escalation in trade tensions would lower euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Ongoing uncertainty about global trade policies could drag investment down. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, remained a major source of uncertainty. Growth could be lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening lasted longer than expected. At the same time, growth could be higher if easier financing conditions and falling inflation allowed domestic consumption and investment to rebound faster. An increase in defence and infrastructure spending could also add to growth. For the near-term outlook, the ECB’s mechanical updates of growth expectations in the first half of 2025 suggested some downside risk. Beyond the near term, it was noted that the baseline projections only included tariffs (and retaliatory measures) already implemented but not those announced or threatened but not yet implemented. The materialisation of additional tariff measures would weigh on euro area exports and investment as well as add to the competitiveness challenges facing euro area businesses. At the same time, the potential fiscal impulse had not been included either. With regard to price developments, members largely agreed that the disinflation process was on track, with inflation continuing to develop broadly as staff had expected. Domestic inflation, which closely tracked services inflation, had declined in January but remained high, as wages and some services prices were still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a delay. However, recent wage negotiations pointed to an ongoing moderation in labour cost pressures, with a lower contribution from profits partially buffering their impact on inflation and most indicators of underlying inflation pointing to a sustained return of inflation to target. Preliminary indicators for labour cost growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 suggested a further moderation, which gave some greater confidence that moderating wage growth would support the projected disinflation process. It was stressed that the annual growth of compensation per employee, which, based on available euro area data, had stood at 4.4% in the third quarter of 2024, should be seen as the most important and most comprehensive measure of wage developments. According to the projections, it was expected to decline substantially by the end of 2025, while available hard data on wage growth were still generally coming in above 4%, and indications from the ECB wage tracker were based only on a limited number of wage agreements for the latter part of 2025. The outlook for wages was seen as a key element for the disinflation path foreseen in the projections, and the sustainable return of inflation to target was still subject to considerable uncertainty. In this context, some concern was expressed that relatively tight labour markets might slow the rate of moderation and that weak labour productivity growth might push up the rate of increase in unit labour costs. With respect to the incoming data, members reiterated that hard data for the first quarter would be crucial for ascertaining further progress with disinflation, as foreseen in the staff projections. The differing developments among the main components of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) were noted. Energy prices had increased but were volatile, and some of the increases had already been reversed most recently. Notwithstanding the increases in the annual rate of change in food prices, momentum in this salient component was down. Developments in the non-energy industrial goods component remained modest. Developments in services were the main focus of discussions. While some concerns were expressed that momentum in services appeared to have remained relatively elevated or had even edged up (when looking at three-month annualised growth rates), it was also argued that the overall tendency was clearly down. It was stressed that detailed hard data on services inflation over the coming months would be key and would reveal to what extent the projected substantial disinflation in services in the first half of 2025 was on track. Regarding the March inflation projections, members commended the improved forecasting performance in recent projection rounds. It was underlined that the 0.2 percentage point upward revision to headline inflation for 2025 primarily reflected stronger energy price dynamics compared with the December projections. Some concern was expressed that inflation was now only projected to reach 2% on a sustained basis in early 2026, rather than in the course of 2025 as expected previously. It was also noted that, although the baseline scenario had been broadly materialising, uncertainties had been increasing substantially in several respects. Furthermore, recent data releases had seen upside surprises in headline inflation. However, it was remarked that the latest upside revision to the headline inflation projections had been driven mainly by the volatile prices of crude oil and natural gas, with the decline in those prices since the cut-off date for the projections being large enough to undo much of the upward revision. In addition, it was underlined that the projections for HICP inflation excluding food and energy were largely unchanged, with staff projecting an average of 2.2% for 2025 and 2.0% for 2026. The argument was made that the recent revisions showed once again that it was misleading to mechanically relate lower growth to lower inflation, given the prevalence of supply-side shocks. With respect to inflation expectations, reference was made to the latest market-based inflation fixings, which were typically highly sensitive to the most recent energy commodity price developments. Beyond the short term, inflation fixings were lower than the staff projections. Attention was drawn to a sharp increase in the five-year forward inflation expectations five years ahead following the latest expansionary fiscal policy announcements. However, it was argued that this measure remained consistent with genuine expectations broadly anchored around 2% if estimated risk premia were taken into account, and there had been a less substantial adjustment in nearer-term inflation compensation. Looking at other sources of evidence on expectations, collected before the fiscal announcements (as was the case for all survey evidence), panellists in the Survey of Monetary Analysts saw inflation close to 2%. Consumer inflation expectations from the ECB Consumer Expectations Survey were generally at higher levels, but they showed a small downtick for one-year ahead expectations. It was also highlighted that firms mentioned inflation in their earnings calls much less frequently, suggesting inflation was becoming less salient. Against this background, members saw a number of uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook. Increasing friction in global trade was adding more uncertainty to the outlook for euro area inflation. A general escalation in trade tensions could see the euro depreciate and import costs rise, which would put upward pressure on inflation. At the same time, lower demand for euro area exports as a result of higher tariffs and a re-routing of exports into the euro area from countries with overcapacity would put downward pressure on inflation. Geopolitical tensions created two-sided inflation risks as regards energy markets, consumer confidence and business investment. Extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected. Inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increased by more than expected. A boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation through its effect on aggregate demand. But inflation might surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand by more than expected. The view was expressed that the prospect of significantly higher fiscal spending, together with a potentially significant increase in inflation in the event of a tariff scenario with retaliation, deserved particular consideration in future risk assessments. Moreover, the risks might be exacerbated by potential second-round effects and upside wage pressures in an environment where inflation had not yet returned to target and the labour market remained tight. In particular, it was argued that the boost to domestic demand from fiscal spending would make it easier for firms to pass through higher costs to consumers rather than absorb them in their profits, at a time when inflation expectations were more fragile and firms had learned to rapidly adapt the frequency of repricing in an environment of high uncertainty. It was argued that growth concerns were mainly structural in nature and that monetary policy was ineffective in resolving structural weaknesses. Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, market interest rates in the euro area had decreased after the Governing Council’s January meeting, before surging in the days immediately preceding the March meeting. Long-term bond yields had risen significantly: for example, the yield on ten-year German government bonds had increased by about 30 basis points in a day – the highest one-day jump since the surge linked to German reunification in March 1990. These moves probably reflected a mix of expectations of higher average policy rates in the future and a rise in the term premium, and represented a tightening of financing conditions. The revised outlook for fiscal policy – associated in particular with the need to increase defence spending – and the resulting increase in aggregate demand were the main drivers of these developments and had also led to an appreciation of the euro. Looking back over a longer period, it was noted that broader financial conditions had already been easing substantially since late 2023 because of factors including monetary policy easing, the stock market rally and the recent depreciation of the euro until the past few days. In this respect, it was mentioned that, abstracting from the very latest developments, after the strong increase in long-term rates in 2022, yields had been more or less flat, albeit with some volatility. However, it was contended that the favourable impact on debt financing conditions of the decline in short-term rates had been partly offset by the recent significant increase in long-term rates. Moreover, debt financing conditions remained relatively tight compared with longer-term historical averages over the past ten to 15 years, which covered the low-interest period following the financial crisis. Wider financial markets appeared to have become more optimistic about Europe and less optimistic about the United States since the January meeting, although some doubt was raised as to whether that divergence was set to last. The ECB’s interest rate cuts were gradually contributing to an easing of financing conditions by making new borrowing less expensive for firms and households. The average interest rate on new loans to firms had declined to 4.2% in January, from 4.4% in December. Over the same period the average interest rate on new mortgages had fallen to 3.3%, from 3.4%. At the same time, lending rates were proving slower to turn around in real terms, so there continued to be a headwind to the easing of financing conditions from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to the stock of credit. This meant that lending rates on the outstanding stock of loans had only declined marginally, especially for mortgages. The recent substantial increase in long-term yields could also have implications for lending conditions by affecting bank funding conditions and influencing the cost of loans linked to long-term yields. However, it was noted that it was no surprise that financing conditions for households and firms still appeared tight when compared with the period of negative interest rates, because longer-term fixed rate loans taken out during the low-interest rate period were being refinanced at higher interest rates. Financing conditions were in any case unlikely to return to where they had been prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the inflation surge. Furthermore, the most recent bank lending survey pointed to neutral or even stimulative effects of the general level of interest rates on bank lending to firms and households. Overall, it was observed that financing conditions were at present broadly as expected in a cycle in which interest rates would have been cut by 150 basis points according to the proposal, having previously been increased by 450 basis points. As for lending volumes, loan growth was picking up, but lending remained subdued overall. Growth in bank lending to firms had risen to 2.0% in January, up from 1.7% in December, on the back of a moderate monthly flow of new loans. Growth in debt securities issued by firms had risen to 3.4% in annual terms. Mortgage lending had continued to rise gradually but remained muted overall, with an annual growth rate of 1.3%, up from 1.1% in December. Underlying momentum in bank lending remained strong, with the three-month and six-month annualised growth rates standing above the annual growth rate. At the same time, it was contended that the recent uptick in bank lending to firms mainly reflected a substitution from market-based financing in response to the higher cost of debt security financing, so that the overall increase in corporate borrowing had been limited. Furthermore, lending was increasing from quite low levels, and the stock of bank loans to firms relative to GDP remained lower than 25 years ago. Nonetheless, the growth of credit to firms was now roughly back to pre-pandemic levels and more than three times the average during the 2010s, while mortgage credit growth was only slightly below the average in that period. On the household side, it was noted that the demand for housing loans was very strong according to the bank lending survey, with the average increase in demand in the last two quarters of 2024 being the highest reported since the start of the survey. This seemed to be a natural consequence of lower interest rates and suggested that mortgage lending would keep rising. However, consumer credit had not really improved over the past year. Strong bank balance sheets had been contributing to the recovery in credit, although it was observed that non-performing and “stage 2” loans – those loans associated with a significant increase in credit risk – were increasing. The credit dynamics that had been picking up also suggested that the decline in excess liquidity held by banks as reserves with the Eurosystem was not adversely affecting banks’ lending behaviour. This was to be expected since banks’ liquidity coverage ratios were high, and it was underlined that banks could in any case post a wide range of collateral to obtain liquidity from the ECB at any time. Turning to the monetary policy stance, members assessed the data that had become available since the last monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements that the Governing Council had communicated in 2023 as shaping its reaction function. These comprised (i) the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation, and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission. Starting with the inflation outlook, members noted that inflation had continued to develop broadly as expected, with incoming data largely in line with the previous projections. Indeed, the central scenario had broadly materialised for several successive quarters, with relatively limited changes in the inflation projections. This was again the case in the March projections, which were closely aligned with the previous inflation outlook. Inflation expectations had remained well anchored despite the very high uncertainty, with most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continuing to stand at around 2%. This suggested that inflation remained on course to stabilise at the 2% inflation target in the medium term. Still, this continued to depend on the materialisation of the projected material decline in wage growth over the course of 2025 and on a swift and significant deceleration in services inflation in the coming months. And, while services inflation had declined in February, its momentum had yet to show conclusive signs of a stable downward trend. It was widely felt that the most important recent development was the significant increase in uncertainty surrounding the outlook for inflation, which could unfold in either direction. There were many unknowns, notably related to tariff developments and global geopolitical developments, and to the outlook for fiscal policies linked to increased defence and other spending. The latter had been reflected in the sharp moves in long-term yields and the euro exchange rate in the days preceding the meeting, while energy prices had rebounded. This meant that, while the baseline staff projection was still a reasonable anchor, a lower probability should be attached to that central scenario than in normal times. In this context, it was argued that such uncertainty was much more fundamental and important than the small revisions that had been embedded in the staff inflation projections. The slightly higher near-term profile for headline inflation in the staff projections was primarily due to volatile components such as energy prices and the exchange rate. Since the cut-off date for the projections, energy prices had partially reversed their earlier increases. With the economy now in the flat part of the disinflation process, small adjustments in the inflation path could lead to significant shifts in the precise timing of when the target would be reached. Overall, disinflation was seen to remain well on track. Inflation had continued to develop broadly as staff had expected and the latest projections closedly aligned with the previous inflation outlook. At the same time, it was widely acknowledged that risks and uncertainty had clearly increased. Turning to underlying inflation, members concurred that most measures of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. Core inflation was coming down and was projected to decline further as a result of a further easing in labour cost pressures and the continued downward pressure on prices from the past monetary policy tightening. Domestic inflation, which closely tracked services inflation, had declined in January but remained high, as wages and prices of certain services were still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. However, while the continuing strength of the labour market and the potentially large fiscal expansion could both add to future wage pressures, there were many signs that wage growth was moderating as expected, with lower profits partially buffering the impact on inflation. Regarding the transmission of monetary policy, recent credit dynamics showed that monetary policy transmission was working, with both the past tightening and recent interest rate cuts feeding through smoothly to market interest rates, financing conditions, including bank lending rates, and credit flows. Gradual and cautious rate cuts had contributed substantially to the progress made towards a sustainable return of inflation to target and ensured that inflation expectations remained anchored at 2%, while securing a soft landing of the economy. The ECB’s monetary policy had supported increased lending. Looking ahead, lags in policy transmission suggested that, overall, credit growth would probably continue to increase. The impact of financial conditions on the economy was discussed. In particular, it was argued that the level of interest rates and possible financing constraints – stemming from the availability of both internal and external funds – might be weighing on corporate investment. At the same time, it was argued that structural factors contributed to the weakness of investment, including high energy and labour costs, the regulatory environment and increased import competition, and high uncertainty, including on economic policy and the outlook for demand. These were seen as more important factors than the level of interest rates in explaining the weakness in investment. Consumption also remained weak and the household saving rate remained high, though this could also be linked to elevated uncertainty rather than to interest rates. On this basis, the view was expressed that it was no longer clear whether monetary policy continued to be restrictive. With the last rate hike having been 18 months previously, and the first cut nine months previously, it was suggested that the balance was increasingly shifting towards the transmission of rate cuts. In addition, although quantitative tightening was operating gradually and smoothly in the background, the stock of asset holdings was still compressing term premia and long-term rates, while the diminishing compression over time implied a tightening. Against this background, almost all members supported the proposal by Mr Lane to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Lowering the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steered the monetary policy stance – was justified by the updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Looking ahead, the point was made that the likely shocks on the horizon, including from escalating trade tensions, and uncertainty more generally, risked significantly weighing on growth. It was argued that these factors could increase the risk of undershooting the inflation target in the medium term. In addition, it was argued that the recent appreciation of the euro and the decline in energy prices since the cut-off date for the staff projections, together with the cooling labour market and well-anchored inflation expectations, mitigated concerns about the upward revision to the near-term inflation profile and upside risks to inflation more generally. From this perspective, it was argued that being prudent in the face of uncertainty did not necessarily equate to being gradual in adjusting the interest rate. By contrast, it was contended that high levels of uncertainty, including in relation to trade policies, fiscal policy developments and sticky services and domestic inflation, called for caution in policy-setting and especially in communication. Inflation was no longer foreseen to return to the 2% target in 2025 in the latest staff projections and the date had now been pushed out to the first quarter of 2026. Moreover, the latest revision to the projected path meant that inflation would by that time have remained above target for almost five years. This concern would be amplified should upside risks to inflation materialise and give rise to possible second-round effects. For example, a significant expansion of fiscal policy linked to defence and other spending would increase price pressures. This had the potential to derail the disinflation process and keep inflation higher for longer. Indeed, investors had immediately reacted to the announcements in the days preceding the meeting. This was reflected in an upward adjustment of the market interest rate curve, dialling back the number of expected rate cuts, and a sharp increase in five-year forward inflation expectations five years ahead. The combination of US tariffs and retaliation measures could also pose upside risks to inflation, especially in the near term. Moreover, firms had also learned to raise their prices more quickly in response to new inflationary shocks. Against this background, a few members stressed that they could only support the proposal to reduce interest rates by a further 25 basis points if there was also a change in communication that avoided any indication of future cuts or of the future direction of travel, which was seen as akin to providing forward guidance. One member abstained, as the proposed communication did not drop any reference to the current monetary policy stance being restrictive. In this context, members discussed in more detail the extent to which monetary policy could still be described as restrictive following the proposed interest rate cut. While it was clear that, with each successive rate cut, monetary policy was becoming less restrictive and closer to most estimates of the natural or neutral rate of interest, different views were expressed in this regard. On the one hand, it was argued that it was no longer possible to be confident that monetary policy was restrictive. It was noted that, following the proposed further cut of 25 basis points, the level of the deposit facility rate would be roughly equal to the current level of inflation. Even after the increase in recent days, long-term yields remained very modest in real terms. Credit and equity risk premia continued to be fairly contained and the euro was not overvalued despite the recent appreciation. There were also many indications in lending markets that the degree of policy restriction had declined appreciably. Credit was responding to monetary policy broadly as expected, with the tightening effect of past rate hikes now gradually giving way to the easing effects of the subsequent rate cuts, which had been transmitting smoothly to market and bank lending rates. This shifting balance was likely to imply a continued move towards easier credit conditions and a further recovery in credit flows. In addition, subdued growth could not be taken as evidence that policy was restrictive, given that the current weakness was seen by firms as largely structural. In this vein, it was also noted that a deposit facility rate of 2.50% was within, or at least at around the upper bound of, the range of Eurosystem staff estimates for the natural or neutral interest rate, with reference to the recently published Economic Bulletin box, entitled “Natural rate estimates for the euro area: insights, uncertainties and shortcomings”. Using the full array of models and ignoring estimation uncertainty, this currently ranged from 1.75% to 2.75%. Notwithstanding important caveats and the uncertainties surrounding the estimates, it was contended that they still provided a guidepost for the degree of monetary policy restrictiveness. Moreover, while recognising the high model uncertainty, it was argued that both model-based and market-based measures suggested that one main driver of the notable increase in the neutral interest rate over the past three years had been the increased net supply of government bonds. In this context, it was suggested that the impending expansionary fiscal policy linked to defence and other spending – and the likely associated increase in the excess supply of bonds – would affect real interest rates and probably lead to a persistent and significant increase in the neutral interest rate. This implied that, for a given policy rate, monetary policy would be less restrictive. On the other hand, it was argued that monetary policy would still be in restrictive territory even after the proposed interest rate cut. Inflation was on a clear trajectory to return to the 2% medium-term target while the euro area growth outlook was very weak. Consumption and investment remained weak despite high employment and past wage increases, consumer confidence continued to be low and the household saving ratio remained at high levels. This suggested an economy in stagnation – a sign that monetary policy was still in restrictive territory. Expansionary fiscal policy also had the potential to increase asset swap spreads between sovereign bond and OIS markets. With a greater sovereign bond supply, that intermediation spread would probably widen, which would contribute to tighter financing conditions. In addition, it was underlined that the latest staff projections were conditional on a market curve that implied about three further rate cuts, indicating that a 2.50% deposit facility rate was above the level necessary to sustainably achieve the 2% target in the medium term. It was stressed, in this context, that the staff projections did not hinge on assumptions about the neutral interest rate. More generally, it was argued that, while the natural or neutral rate could be a useful concept when policy rates were very far away from it and there was a need to communicate the direction of travel, it was of little value for steering policy on a meeting-by-meeting basis. This was partly because its level was fundamentally unobservable, and so it was subject to significant model and parameter uncertainty, a wide range between minimum and maximum estimates, and changing estimates over time. The range of estimates around the midpoint and the uncertainty bands around each estimate underscored why it was important to avoid excessive focus on any particular value. Rather, it was better to simply consider what policy setting was appropriate at any given point in time to meet the medium-term inflation target in light of all factors and shocks affecting the economy, including structural elements. To the extent that consideration should be given to the natural or neutral interest rate, it was noted that the narrower range of the most reliable staff estimates, between 1.75% and 2.25%, indicated that monetary policy was still restrictive at a deposit facility rate of 2.50%. Overall, while there had been a measurable increase in the natural interest rate since the pandemic, it was argued that it was unlikely to have reached levels around 2.5%. Against this background, the proposal by Mr Lane to change the wording of the monetary policy statement by replacing “monetary policy remains restrictive” with “monetary policy is becoming meaningfully less restrictive” was widely seen as a reasonable compromise. On the one hand, it was acknowledged that, after a sustained sequence of rate reductions, the policy rate was undoubtedly less restrictive than at earlier stages in the current easing phase, but it had entered a range in which it was harder to determine the precise level of restrictiveness. In this regard, “meaningfully” was seen as an important qualifier, as monetary policy had already become less restrictive with the first rate cut in June 2024. On the other hand, while interest rates had already been cut substantially, the formulation did not rule out further cuts, even if the scale and timing of such cuts were difficult to determine ex ante. On the whole, it was considered important that the amended language should not be interpreted as sending a signal in either direction for the April meeting, with both a cut and a pause on the table, depending on incoming data. The proposed change in the communication was also seen as a natural progression from the previous change, implemented in December. This had removed the intention to remain “sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary” and shifted to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance, on a meeting-by-meeting basis, depending on incoming data. From this perspective there was no need to identify the neutral interest rate, particularly given that future policy might need to be above, at or below neutral, depending on the inflation and growth outlook. Looking ahead, members reiterated that the Governing Council remained determined to ensure that inflation would stabilise sustainably at its 2% medium-term target. Its interest rate decisions would continue to be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Uncertainty was particularly high and rising owing to increasing friction in global trade, geopolitical developments and the design of fiscal policies to support increased defence and other spending. This underscored the importance of following a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release. The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting. * Members not holding a voting right in March 2025 under Article 10.2 of the ESCB Statute. ** In accordance with Article 284 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

Title: The U.S. Economy Is Being Led Over a Cliff by an Idiot and His Lemmings

By Dustin Rowles | News | April 3, 2025 | I hope everyone enjoyed their brief respite from the horrors of the current administration after a rare good day — well, half a day — because by 4 p.m. yesterday, the President delivered a rambling, nonsensical, and infuriating speech announcing a boatload of new tariffs that many are calling “worse than the worst-case scenario.” Trump imposed a 10 percent tariff across the board, excluding Mexico and Canada, which already face their own 25 percent tariffs. Countries he labeled “bad actors” are getting hit with cumulative tariffs as high as 60 percent. The EU is facing a 20 percent tariff. The UK — with whom we have a trade surplus — is still being slapped with a 10 percent tariff. The formula Trump used, which the internet reverse-engineered as completely batshit, is erratic at best. If the tariffs hold (and with Trump, who knows?), the country is effectively looking at a $600 billion annual tax. Grocery prices are going to rise. Electronics, sneakers, and clothing will get more expensive. Inflation will surge, and the stock market will sink. Early indicators suggest as much as a 5 percent drop in the NASDAQ when the bell rings this morning — unsurprising, given that the tech industry sources many of its parts from countries hit hardest by tariffs (China, Vietnam, India, Taiwan). The price of a new Subaru Crosstrek, I read, will rise by around $10,000. The new Nintendo Switch could jump by as much as $120, with new games rising by $30. Consumers will delay buying cars, computers, and washing machines, which will hurt retailers like Amazon, Target, and Walmart — leading to layoffs and a higher unemployment rate. We’ve seen this cycle before: companies slash advertising and marketing budgets, hurting giants like Google and Facebook and, by extension, the rest of the media. And the thing is, it’s all so f**king pointless. Ostensibly, the goal is to increase U.S. manufacturing, but we’re a service-based economy — and those services will be hit with retaliatory tariffs, triggering even more economic pain. The idea that companies like Nike or Apple will move their manufacturing to the U.S. ignores the reality: higher wages mean higher prices, which leads to more inflation. And even if companies wanted to come back, the U.S. isn’t equipped to restart large-scale manufacturing. It would take years — only to see the next administration (or Trump himself) reverse course again. The President of the United States doesn’t understand how the economy works, and the Republican Congress is too chickenshit to take back the tariff powers they do legally possess. Yesterday, the Senate — with help from a few Republican Senators (McConnell, Rand, Collins, and Murkowski) — passed legislation reversing the Canadian tariffs, but it’s expected to die in the House, despite the warning sign from the Florida special election about how vulnerable swing-state Republicans may be. Trump needs to be neutered. Congress has the power to do it. Instead, they’re pushing ahead with a plan to renew and expand the Trump tax cuts — to appease the billionaires currently taking a bath in the stock market. But even they may not see much of a net gain. For the rest of us: we get nothing but a faltering economy and shrinking 401Ks as the market continues its tumble. It’s bad. It’s real bad. There are no winners here. And the best we can hope for is that Trump panics at the market plunge and negotiates carve-outs or exceptions. But it may be too late. Hell, the rest of the world hates us now, too — because we’re tanking their economies right along with ours. We’re being led over a cliff by an idiot and his lemmings. But hey! At least the White House may push out Elon Musk in the coming weeks.

Title: Trump unveils new tariffs and CDC's IVF team is eliminated: Morning Rundown

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Global markets fall following Trump’s tariff announcements. The CDC team that tracked IVF across the country was eliminated. And a college student who was the subject of a viral rumor amplified by prominent figures said it “ruined” her life. Here’s what to know today. President Donald Trump announced expansive tariffs on the United States’ largest trading partners impacting billions, if not trillions, of dollars in trade. China would be hit with a 54% tariff, the European Union with 20%, India with 26% and Japan with 24%, among many others. The White House arrived at the percentages based on how it is calculating duties on U.S. exports, as well as “nonmonetary” trade barriers based on things like countries’ manipulating their currencies or serving as “pollution havens,” but it was not immediately clear how the exact numbers were calculated. China said it would “resolutely take countermeasures” against the U.S., with the Chinese Commerce Ministry calling Trump’s latest move “a typical act of unilateral bullying.” The European Union threatened countermeasures by mid-April, and Canada warned last week that it was preparing retaliatory moves. The Trump administration has signaled it is uninterested in diplomacy, raising the odds that foreign leaders will hit back with more levies of their own rather than pressing for talks. In other words, this trade war is just getting started, NBC News senior business correspondent Christine Romans and business and data correspondent Brian Cheung wrote in an analysis. “This is a game changer, not only for the U.S. economy, but for the global economy,” Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in a note yesterday evening. “Many countries will likely end up in a recession.” Speaking from the White House Rose Garden yesterday afternoon, Trump slammed what he said were “much higher” import taxes on goods coming from the U.S. compared to what the U.S. had charged other countries for their exports. He argued that the U.S. has been getting “ripped off” by other nations while working-class wages languished. With these new tariffs, American industry “will be reborn,” the president said, touting a new “golden age of America.” But the tariffs won’t provide an immediate jolt to the economy. Instead, they’re expected to take a toll on many companies whose products rely on global supply chains and now could be forced to raise prices or endure thinner profit margins.

Public health experts and IVF advocates said they are shocked at the elimination of the CDC's Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance team — a group of six epidemiologists, data analysts and researchers that tracked how well in vitro fertilization worked across the U.S. Their layoffs were part of the sweeping cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services and come just a week after President Donald Trump declared himself "the fertilization president" while touting efforts to expand IVF. The team worked under the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health, which was also gutted this week, and was responsible for monitoring and tracking outcomes related to IVF. It also maintained an “IVF success estimator,” a tool that allowed people to estimate how well IVF would work for them and contained data about clinics’ success rates across the country. “This is a big handicap for the administration as they embrace IVF and want to expand coverage,” said Barbara Collura, the president and CEO of a nonprofit group for reproductive health. An HHS official said the “work will continue” but did not provide details. Read the full story here. A 19-year-old University of Mississippi student who was the subject of an internet rumor amplified by notable figures including popular ESPN host and analyst Pat McAfee is speaking out, saying the barrage of harassment she received has “ruined” her life. It’s “the worst feeling in the world,” Mary Kate Cornett said in an interview with NBC News’ Tom Llamas. “It makes you feel so alone. It’s a horrible experience.” Cornett said her friends first told her about a rumor that was spreading on an anonymous messaging app called YikYak, about a student in her sorority who was sleeping with her boyfriend’s father. Eventually, she saw that her name was a trending topic on X. The rumor referenced on “The Pat McAfee Show” alleged a “ménage à trois” at Ole Miss, but Cornett and her boyfriend were not mentioned by name in the show. After Cornett’s number was shared online, she said she was overwhelmed with “thousands” of calls and texts, with some telling her she “deserved to die.” Cornett said she intends to take legal action against McAfee and ESPN, and potentially others who, she said, helped spread the rumor. “I’m not a public figure that you can go talk about on your show to get more views,” she said.

As an Arsenal soccer fan living more than 5,000 away in Los Angeles, I wanted a place to see the Gunners face Aston Villa earlier this season. My options were to watch alone at home, in a crowded bar or at a new venue called Cosm. I tried the latter and my mind was blown. Thanks to proprietary technology that includes cameras shooting live in 12K resolution, I was instantly transported to Villa Park in England. On an 87-foot diameter LED screen, players appeared super close. Crowd noise from the stadium filled the air as if you were part of the supporters’ section. It was the closest I’d get to actually being there. I returned to Cosm — which currently has locations in L.A. and Dallas, with Detroit and Atlanta opening in the coming months — to check out the NCAA Tournament.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Plaid, which connects bank accounts to financial applications, has sold about $575 million worth of common stock at a $6.1 billion post-money valuation, the fintech company confirmed to TechCrunch. The valuation is about less than half of the $13.4 billion that San Francisco-based Plaid was valued at when it raised a $425 million Series D in April 2021 in a round led by Altimeter Capital. A spokesperson acknowledged the decrease, saying it was “simply a reflection of the contraction of multiples across the market.” Indeed, higher interest rates have led to lower valuations for many startups that last raised at the top of the high cycle in 2021. Still, Plaid’s new valuation is about 15% higher than the $5.3 billion Visa was going to pay for the company before that acquisition deal fell apart in January of 2021 due to regulatory concerns. Plaid will not go public in 2025 but it is a milestone the company continues “to track towards,” according to the spokesperson. In October 2023, Plaid named former Expedia exec Eric Hart to serve as its new chief financial officer. The fact that it appeared to be eyeing an IPO — albeit with no timeline — drew attention. Today, the company maintains that it is “well-capitailized.” “Plaid’s business is in a great position and we’re optimistic about the opportunity ahead,” the spokesperson said. Franklin Templeton led the “oversubscribed” raise, which also included participation from new backers Fidelity Management and Research, BlackRock, and others in addition to existing investors NEA and Ribbit Capital. Plaid characterized the transaction as “not a Series E,” but rather a sale of common stock, which involves a company directly issuing new shares to raise capital. This is different from a secondary share sale, which occurs when existing shareholders sell their shares to other investors, without the company receiving any new capital. The proceeds of the round will be used to address employee tax withholding obligations related to the conversion of expiring RSUs (restricted stock units) to shares, and to offer some liquidity to its current team via an employee tender offer, CEO and co-founder Zach Perret (pictured above) said in a blog post. While the company did not break down how much capital exactly was going toward each initiative, a spokesperson told TechCrunch the majority of the secondary sale was going toward the conversion of the RSUs that will be expiring in the coming years. “We raised the capital to cover the RSU expiry issue and there is a small tender for employees, but it is not the entirety of the round,” the spokesperson said. Restricted stock units are typically issued to employees through a vesting schedule after they achieve required performance milestones or upon remaining with their employer for a particular length of time. This raise comes on the heels of what Perret described as a “record-setting year on revenue, a return to positive operating margins, and a meaningful increase in the companies and markets” Plaid serves. He didn’t provide hard revenue figures, saying that revenue grew over 25% in 2024 and that the company was approaching “sustained profitability.” In a shareholder letter viewed by TechCrunch, Perret also wrote that new products represented more than 20% of Plaid’s ARR in 2024, “compounding at 93% annually.” Founded in 2012, Plaid got its start as a company that connects consumer bank accounts to financial applications but has since been gradually expanding its offerings to also include lending, identity verification, credit reporting, anti-fraud, and payments. Being a multi-product company has led to traction beyond the traditional fintech customers it started out serving. President Jen Taylor told TechCrunch last June that enterprise and traditional financial institution growth was “starting to outpace the rest of its business.” Overall, Plaid saw “a big upswing in the number of enterprises” it serves in 2024, Perret wrote in the shareholder letter. The company counts Citi, Robinhood, H&R Block, Invitation Homes, GoFundMe, Zillow, and Rocket as “key customers.” Perret also wrote: “Our goal is to build software that makes the financial system easier and better for everyone. Our products are the bedrock upon which many of the most well-known financial brands are built – companies like Affirm, Chime, Robinhood, and SoFi.” Plaid has raised about $1.3 billion in funding over its lifetime. Presently, it has 1,200 employees across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the EU.

Title: Plaid Raises $575 Million In Funding At $6.1 Billion Valuation

ByJeff Kauflin ByJeff Kauflin, Forbes Staff. Plaid CEO Zach Perret is raising money to cover an upcoming tax bill and to let employees sell some of their Plaid stock. San Francisco-based Plaid, whose main business is helping fintechs and other companies connect to consumers’ bank accounts, is raising $575 million in a deal that values it at $6.1 billion, down more than 50% from the $13.4 billion it reached in 2021. The investment is being led by large asset management firms including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity Management and Research and BlackRock, with venture capital firms NEA and Ribbit also investing. A spokesperson for the 12-year-old company says most of the proceeds will be used to cover tax liabilities that will come due over the next few years, when employees’ restricted stock units (RSUs)—a form of equity compensation where a business promises to grant you stock at a future date–vest and convert into common stock. Plaid will use a “small portion” of the $575 million fundraise to buy back stock from employees in a tender offer, letting them cash out a small part of their Plaid stock, according to a spokesperson. After Plaid pays for its coming tax liability and the employee tender offer, it will use whatever is left of the $575 million to help fund its business, though it expects that to be “a minimal amount.” Have a story tip? Contact Jeff Kauflin at jkauflin@forbes.com or on Signal at jeff.273. Stripe took a similar step in March 2023 with a $6.5 billion tender offer that allowed employees to sell their private shares in the company, and it has done at least two more tender offers since then. In recent years, Plaid has expanded beyond its core bank-account-linking features into three new lines of business: credit-risk analytics, fraud prevention and pay-by-bank. That has helped reverse the growth slowdown the company saw in 2023, when it expanded just 12%. In 2024, its revenue rose 25% and exceeded $300 million, and its gross profit margin was roughly 80%, according to a person familiar with its business. The company still wasn’t profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. The fintech market has improved notably since it began on a downward trajectory in 2022. In the first quarter of 2025, fintechs raised roughly $10.3 billion in funding globally, according to CB Insights, the highest quarterly total since the first quarter of 2023. Digital bank Chime and buy-now, pay-later giant Klarna are planning to go public over the next few months, but Plaid is unlikely to try to IPO this year. “Our hope is that we will get there in the next couple years, but no plans for a 2025 IPO,” Plaid CEO Zach Perret told Bloomberg in January. Last month, The Information reported that Plaid was planning a fundraise at a valuation of roughly $6 billion.

It’s impossible to predict (time) what the market will do. By the time you see the information in the media the market players have already priced in the moves. We, the great unwashed, are too far down the information train to do anything effective. Having said that, we’re in a war with another one threatening. You could hardly do badly buying the military industrial complex. But Amazon and Visa have outperformed most of them. With only one exception I own only American companies because we have the most “honest” bookkeeping. Buy and only sell when you notice a long slow decline. That means the people running the company have taken their eye off the ball. Go to Yahoo finance and call up the long-term stock price chart. They generally trend into the same direction until they either double or crash and burn.

If you need the money in the next couple years, keep it in a money market fund. 4% is not too bad with minimal risk. For five years or more, it has always been best to invest in the stock market (i. e. our overall economy). For the longer period mentioned, dollar cost averaging in the S&P500 on the way down is the way to go. No one ever knows the bottom. I’ve done that for a long time, and it has been great. ETF’s are more tax efficient than mutual funds.

Title: The Biggest Billionaire Gainers 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roycanivel/2025/04/03/the-biggest-billionaire-gainers-2025/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T10:30:00Z

ByRoy Canivel ByRoy Canivel, Forbes Staff. The past 12 months have been very good to the planet’s billionaires. There are more of them (3,028) than ever before and they’re richer than they’ve ever been (worth a combined $16.1 trillion). Overall, the billionaire class is nearly $2 trillion richer than last year. But the big gains have not been shared evenly: $453 billion of the increase comes just from ten super fortunate people. These ten biggest gainers on Forbes’ 2025 World’s Billionaires list each added tens of billions—or, in one case, more than $100 billion—to their already-massive fortunes since the 2024 ranking. They made their money in retail, finance and, mainly, tech. No one in the world gained more than Elon Musk, who took back the title of richest person in the world after a stellar year for his startups SpaceX and xAI, plus a 12-month rise in the share price of Tesla, despite a recent selloff. Musk is an astonishing $147 billion richer this year. He’s the only billionaire to add nine figures to his net worth since the 2024 list. Eight of the ten are American citizens, either through birth or, in the case of Musk, naturalization. The other two are Lei Jun, a Chinese citizen whose fortune grew by 300%, to an estimated $43.5 billion, thanks to higher demand for his company’s electric cars, and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, a Canadian citizen worth an estimated $62.9 billion amid a jump in crypto markets. Tim Pannell for Forbes The only daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992), she became the world’s richest woman in September, her first time since 2022. She hit the $100 billion mark in November as Walmart shares climbed to record highs. The stock is up more than 53% since last year. Best known for spearheading the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in her family’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, Walton has given away an estimated $1.7 billion, including her most recent gift, disclosed in an August filing, of $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, also in Bentonville. Changpeng Zhao, who goes by CZ, is the founder and former CEO of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. In November 2023, Zhao stepped down as Binance's CEO as part of a sweeping settlement with U.S. authorities. He pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and was sentenced to four months in prison. He also paid a $50 million fine. He’s richer this year amid bull crypto markets and a Forbes investigation into his vast holdings of Binance’s exchange-issued token, BNB. Despite demands from the Justice Department to break up Google, the Alphabet cofounder and board member is $30 billion richer thanks to a 30% rise in the Google parent company’s shares. Page, who stepped down as Alphabet CEO in 2019, is reportedly working on a new company that plans to apply AI to manufacturing. The youngest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992), he retired from Walmart’s board in 2016 and yielded the seat to his son Steuart. He remains the chairman of the family's Arvest Bank Group, which boasts assets of $26 billion. The cofounder of Susquehanna International Group, one of Wall Street's largest and most successful trading firms, has invested in hundreds of private companies globally, including TikTok parent ByteDance, its most valuable holding based on Forbes reporting. He’s benefitted as ByteDance’s valuation has hit $312 billion in private markets amid a bidding war over TikTok. In September, he became the first member of America’s richest family to join the $100 billion club, on the back of rising Walmart shares. The eldest son of Sam Walton (d. 1992), he retired from the board in June 2024, after more than four decades as a director. Visual China Group via Getty Images From budget-friendly smartphones to electric vehicles, Xiaomi has come a long way since Lei Jun cofounded the Hong Kong-listed company in 2010. With the firm’s electric vehicle venture seeing higher demand for its cars, shares have climbed more than 300%. Last year, Lei was worth an estimated $10.9 billion. He is also the chairman of Hong Kong-listed software firm Kingsoft and an investor in JOYY Inc., a Nasdaq-listed live-streaming and social media platform formerly known as YY.com. Not long ago, Mark Zuckerberg banned President Donald Trump from Facebook and Instagram following the January 6 riots. One presidential election later, the Meta founder has friended Trump, including putting pro-Trump entrepreneur Dana White on Meta’s board in early January and cohosting an inauguration reception for the president alongside several Republican billionaires. Shares of his social media giant have surged nearly 25% since last year’s list, making Zuck the second richest person in the world for the first time. Ellison, too, has been sticking close to Trump. He may not have been front and center among tech tycoons during the president’s inauguration, but he stood a few feet away from Trump when the president soon announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative backed, in part, by Ellison’s software firm Oracle. Ellison’s net worth went up by $51 billion this year thanks to a growing AI business that helped push Oracle’s stock price up by 40%. AFP via Getty Images Thanks to an incredible $147 billion year, Elon Musk, yet again, is the richest person alive. All of his largest assets have gone up in value: Tesla stock is up 50% since last year’s list, rocket maker SpaceX is worth $350 billion, nearly double its valuation from last year, and Musk’s artificial intelligence business, xAI, raised $6 billion from private investors at a $50 billion valuation in November—then, last week, Musk announced that xAI was acquiring X (formerly Twitter) in an all-stock deal that valued X at more than what Musk paid in 2022, and boosted xAI’s valuation to an apparent $80 billion–a $30 billion bump from just three months ago.

Global stocks are slumping Thursday after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners that were worse that investors expected and raised fears of a growing trade war. U.S. stocks are plunging, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1,200 points. Investors are seeking haven trades such as Treasurys, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.06%. The Stoxx Europe 600 index ended 2.7% lower, while Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed down 2.8% and 1.5%, respectively. Also tumbling Thursday are Magnificent Seven stocks, led by an 8% plunge for Apple (AAPL), which Citi estimates makes more than 90% of its products in China. The country faces 54% in cumulative import tariffs. Shares of the rest—Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—all dropped. "The tariff announcement was worse than most investors expected," BNP Paribas Asset Management Chief Market Strategist Daniel Morris wrote in a note Thursday. "The key question now will be whether there is scope for negotiation on the reciprocal tariffs." UPDATE—April 3, 2025: This article has been updated to include refreshed share prices.

U.S. futures indexes fell sharply early on Thursday, led by a deep slide in major tech stocks, while global markets also faced a major selloff after President Donald Trump’s sweeping reciprocal tariffs raised fears of a global trade war and recession. Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) ... More after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC. The benchmark S&P Futures were down around 3.1% to 5,534.25 points in premarket trading early on Thursday, while contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.51% to 41,424 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index was the worst hit, falling 3.45% to 19,079.75 in the premarket, led by slumps in the share prices of major tech companies. Shares of Apple were down more than 7.3% to $207.50 early trading on Monday. Amazon’s stock dropped to $185.01 in premarket, down more than 5.5% from Wednesday’s closing price. Despite semiconductors being exempted from Trump’s reciprocal tariff measures, shares of chipmaker Nvidia fell 4.26% to $105.72 in early trading. Shares of other tech giants like Google, Meta and Microsoft were also down, falling 2.43%, 3.5% and 2% respectively.

European markets also began the day in red, as the Ftse 100 was down 1.34% in morning trading, while the pan-Europe Euro Stoxx 50 fell 2.27%. The premarket slump in Apple’s stock comes as the company’s supply hubs appear to have taken the brunt of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. In recent years, Apple has tried to diversify its supply chain and reduce dependence on China by setting up manufacturing hubs for its iPhones and other devices in Vietnam and India. On Wednesday, Trump announced levies of 34% for all imports from China—where a majority of Apple’s iPhones are assembled. This 34% is on top of the previously announced 20% tariffs—bringing the total to 54%. Imports from Vietnam will also face a steep 46% tariff rate, products made in India will face a 26% levy. ‘No Winner In A Trade War’: China, EU And Others React To Trump’s Reciprocal Tariffs (Forbes) Trump Announces Reciprocal Tariff Rates—54% For China, 20% On EU (Live Updates) (Forbes) Trump Imposes Tariffs On Uninhabited Heard And McDonald Islands—‘Remotest Places On Earth’ (Forbes) Here’s The Full List Of Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs Announced Wednesday (Forbes) One Community.

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold AVGO Stock At $170 Amid Trump’s Tariffs?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AVGO Stock Following President Trump’s announcement of extensive tariffs on over 100 countries, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock fell by over 6% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The announced tariffs include a significant 34% levy on imports from China, a major global manufacturing hub. While semiconductor goods are reportedly exempt from these specific tariffs, the broader macroeconomic consequences are a concern. The imposition of tariffs on Chinese products is expected to increase costs within the economy, potentially leading to slower economic growth or even a recession. This economic downturn could, in turn, reduce overall investment in areas like Artificial Intelligence, which could negatively impact Broadcom’s sales and future performance. Separately, see Will Apple Stock Fall To $150 On Tariff Troubles? Notably, AVGO stock looks attractive, given its solid financial performance lately, but it trades at lofty valuations making it a tricky pick at its current price of around $170. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AVGO stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Broadcom along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Broadcom’s Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Broadcom’s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. AVGO stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Broadcom’s strong performance suggests that its stock might be an attractive investment. However, this positive outlook is tempered by the stock’s high valuation. Currently, AVGO is trading at 13 times its trailing revenues and 140 times its trailing earnings. This is notably higher than its average valuation over the past four years, which stood at 14 times sales and 71 times earnings. Consequently, despite its robust performance, the stock appears expensive based on these metrics, leading to the conclusion that AVGO is a potentially tricky stock to buy at its current price. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Boomers face a 'devastating' blow to their life savings as more tariff pain looms, finance guru warns

Many people could be left disappointed when they open their IRA statements in the coming days — and President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs threaten to make things even worse. The S&P 500 fell 5% in the first three months of 2025, marking its worst quarter since 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 10% as stocks like Tesla plunged 36%. Those declines have taken a bite out of many people's investments in the stock market, and could disrupt their retirement plans if they continue. "For the small investor, the decline in value will be devastating, particularly for retired baby boomers" who draw their incomes from their retirement accounts, Peter Ricchiuti, a senior professor of finance at Tulane University's Freeman School of Business, told Business Insider. The sell-off is partly in reaction to Trump's topsy-turvy tariffs in recent weeks, which have made it "impossible" for business owners to make decisions, Ricchiuti said. The former investment manager, who once oversaw Louisiana's $3 billion portfolio as the assistant state treasurer, said that running a company has become a "game of Whack-A-Mole" because everyone is trying to guess which industry will be hit next. Trump unveiled tariffs of at least 10% on imports from virtually all foreign countries on Wednesday, with higher rates for nations with a large trade deficit with the US. Goods from China, the number-two exporter to the US after Mexico, will be subject to a 54% tariff from April 9 if nothing changes. The news sent the S&P down almost 5% on Thursday, as key constituents Tesla and Nvidia tumbled by about 6% and 8% respectively. Tariffs push up costs for companies and prices for consumers, while uncertainty discourages hiring, expansion, and spending. Those forces slow corporate earnings growth, eroding valuations and sending stocks lower, Ricchiuti said. Strategists at Goldman Sachs cut their S&P 500 forecast last week, citing the incoming tariffs as their main rationale. They predicted the index would decline a further 5% this quarter and gain 6% over the next 12 months, down from 0% and 16%, respectively. One pressing concern is that Trump ratcheting up import taxes will cause countries around the world to retaliate by imposing reciprocal tariffs on imports from the US. Ricchiuti said that's one reason why tariffs never succeed in leveling terms of trade and instead act as "prosperity killers." During Trump's first term, he imposed sweeping tariffs on goods ranging from steel and aluminum to solar panels and washing machines, and broad-based duties on imports from China. The tariffs led to material price increases and reductions in Americans' real income, studies have found. Another worry for investors and everyday Americans alike is that if tariffs lead consumers to cut back on spending and companies to retrench, overall economic growth could suffer. Ricchiuti flagged there is mounting concern on Wall Street that Trump's trade battles will "cause a recession or even the much-feared stagflation." BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described the national mood in his yearly letter on Monday. "I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader — nearly every person — I talk to: They're more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory," he wrote. Another wave of tariff chaos is now threatening to hit stocks that have already retreated. The timing is terrible for boomers living off their nest eggs, who could see their retirement funds dwindle if they're pulling money out at the same time their stock holdings are falling in value. Ricchiuti bemoaned that the economy was on a good path with falling inflation and record corporate earnings and stock prices ahead of Trump's inauguration. "The worst part of all this is that these economic wounds are self-inflicted," he said. Jump to

Title: AMZN Stock To $120? How Tariffs Could Reshape Amazon's Future

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 25 March 2025, Bavaria, Munich: The logo and lettering of global online mail order company Amazon ... More can be seen under the blue sky on the façade of Amazon Germany's headquarters in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on March 25, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of sweeping tariffs on goods from over 100 countries has sparked concerns about a potential trade war. This could reignite inflation and weigh heavily on the broader U.S. economy and consumer spending. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), in particular, stands to be significantly affected as its online shopping marketplace is heavily dependent on goods sold by third-party merchants in China who supply a significant portion of the goods sold on Amazon. These tariffs could therefore drive up landed costs for a large proportion of Amazon’s inventory. Consequently, a trade war could also reignite inflation and weigh on the broader U.S. economy and consumer spending. Also, see Buy, Sell, Or Hold AVGO Stock At $170 Amid Trump’s Tariffs? Amazon’s stock is not immune to economic downturns and it could face substantial losses. Evidence from 2022 shows that Amazon’s stock value decreased by over 50% within a few quarters. This begs the question: If a downturn similar to the one we saw in 2022 were to materialize, could Amazon’s stock, which was around $240 in February, potentially plummet to below $120? Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio — and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. The concerns raised earlier about the potential impact of tariffs on Amazon are particularly relevant now due to the current economic landscape. While Amazon, like many retailers, has always sourced goods from China and domestic brands with Chinese manufacturing, the present situation presents a larger risk. The recently announced sweeping tariffs, coupled with the increasing possibility of a widespread trade war with key global partners, puts a significant strain on Amazon's global supply chain. This disruption could lead to higher prices for products across its platform, which, in turn, is likely to dampen overall consumer demand. The latest tariff announcement, including a substantial 34% levy on Chinese imports — a major global manufacturing hub — further underscores this risk. As these tariffs on Chinese products take effect, the resulting costs will inevitably be absorbed somewhere in the supply chain. This could mean reduced profit margins for Amazon, or ultimately, higher prices passed on to consumers. Furthermore, Trump's recent aggressive trade policies have reignited fears of a resurgence in inflation, which could further erode consumer spending power and negatively impact retailers like Amazon. All of this means the U.S. economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession — our analysis here on the macro picture. In fact, Goldman Sachs recently revised its forecast, increasing the likelihood of a U.S. recession to 35%, up from its previous estimate of 20%, the Wall Street Journal reported. Given the elevated geopolitical uncertainty, partly fueled by potential policy shifts from the new Trump administration, several critical risks warrant attention. The ongoing war in Ukraine continues to contribute to global instability, and the landscape of international trade remains uncertain. Specifically, the implementation of tariffs can lead to increased import costs, which often translate into higher prices for consumers, reduced disposable income, and ultimately, weaker consumer spending. This presents a significant challenge for companies like Amazon, whose business model is heavily reliant on robust consumer discretionary spending. AMZN stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on AMZN stock? Our dashboard — How Low Can Amazon.com Stock Go In A Market Crash? — has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. Adding to these concerns, Amazon’s stock currently appears relatively expensive, trading at 3.3 times its trailing revenues. This is slightly higher than the stock’s average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.7 times over the past three years. Given this valuation and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the questions: Do you want to hold on to your AMZN stock now? Will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $150, $120, or even lower levels? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy. Trefis works with Empirical Asset Management — a Boston area wealth manager — whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Could the US and China Conclude an Agreement Halting the Momentum Toward Conflict?

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access How Trump’s attack on the global order endangers a deal Beijing might otherwise accept. An unexpected bright spot in the months following Trump’s election victory was his repeated support for some kind of agreement with China. Under Biden, the two most powerful countries in the world had seemed headed for certain conflict, and Trump’s campaign bluster promised even worse tensions. But now Trump was claiming that the two countries “can, together, solve all of the problems of the world,” and China was discreetly sending out feelers about what it could offer to bring off such a deal. Then suddenly, the whole tenor of the relationship abruptly changed. On March 4, China’s Foreign Ministry said: “If the US is determined to fight a tariff war, a trade war—or any other kind of war—China will meet the attack and fight to the finish.” Two days later, the ministry doubled down on the theme, promising that, “no matter if it’s a cold war or a hot war,” the US will not win. The events of March 4 lay bare the reasons that Trump is, at one and the same time, tantalizingly close to his proclaimed goal of world peace and alarmingly close to sending the relationship with China spiraling into conflict. Trump’s antipathy toward the global order, now inspiring an unprecedented attack on the post-Cold War institutions that once sustained American power, is both the reason he can offer such a deal and a source of deep disquiet in Beijing. Deciphering this tension is the key to understanding not just Trump’s China policy but his whole foreign policy agenda. What led to the sudden shift in Chinese rhetoric? Earlier on March 4, alongside 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada that were soon suspended, Trump unceremoniously imposed on China his second across-the-board 10 percent tariff increase in as many months. Like the first one, he justified this one with an absolutist demand—difficult both practically and politically—that China immediately suppress the production of all fentanyl precursor chemicals. Just weeks into his second term, Trump has already quietly levied larger tariffs on China than across the entire world-shaking trade war of his first term—and those first-term tariffs are still in place. Also on March 4, Hong Kong firm C K Hutchison announced that it would sell its overseas ports business—including its two (of five total) Panama Canal ports—to US asset firm BlackRock. While both companies insisted that the sale was a normal commercial transaction, the context of Trump’s repeated condemnation of a “Chinese” presence in the canal was lost on no one. China is now considering how it might prevent the sale from going forward. In his address to Congress that same night, Trump bragged about the ports sale but otherwise barely raised the issue of China. His repeated threats against the territorial integrity of various allies, though, must have raised questions within the sovereignty-obsessed Chinese leadership. Despite these misgivings, Beijing has continued to express its interest in negotiations. After all, Trump’s mercantile sensibility and his disdain for the sacred cows of American geopolitical primacy allow him to take seriously Chinese interests and consider a settlement that could work for both powers. This marks a sharp contrast with Biden’s foreign policy team, who imagined they could avoid conflict with China by conducting rudimentary diplomatic routines even as they steadily exacerbated the pressures toward conflict. The core Biden strategy was to build up US alliances around the principle of excluding China while offering concessions to countries in the Global South if they joined such an exclusionary regime. Convinced of their own righteousness, the administration had difficulty recognizing how such an approach looked from Beijing. Trump, in contrast, recognizes a kindred spirit in Xi Jinping, who shares his own priorities of commercial success and authoritarian control. Unlike Biden’s foreign policy team, Trump does not seek strategic advantage over every space of geopolitical power in the world, so he is less likely to exacerbate Beijing’s fears of encirclement or its anxiety that Taiwan could be permanently separated. Moreover, Trump conceptualizes the economy as a market, where those with bargaining power squeeze profit out of those who lack it, rather than a supply chain, in which power accumulates at strategic nodes associated with scarce goods or technologies. This, too, makes agreement with Beijing more likely, since Trump places less priority than Biden on strangling China’s access to technology or demanding deep changes to China’s political economy. All of this substantiates the hope that the US and China could conclude an agreement capable of breaking the momentum toward conflict. More than Trump’s hunger to see himself as a dealmaker, his whole mode of reasoning establishes the conditions for mutual accommodation between the two powers. Yet both the style and substance of Trump’s leadership also pose a significant threat to that potential. Despite a more pliable set of officials staffing his second than his first administration, the trademark chaos of the first term is just as evident today. That is profoundly unnerving to Beijing, characteristically stuck on protocol and obsessed with stability. Illustrative of the diplomatic pitfalls of such disorganization is that, even after two rounds of punishing tariffs, the administration still can’t explain what it actually wants from China. The shift in Chinese rhetoric in part registers exasperation. However, the most dangerous part of Trump’s foreign policy is not the erratic diplomacy but what seems to be the unifying line running through all the vacillations. Whether threatening to annex neighbors, smashing up the world humanitarian system, shredding the rules of global trade, or actively supporting the nativist opposition across a number of allies, the common thread of all the administration’s early foreign policy moves is open hostility to what remains of the institutions and ideology of neoliberal globalization. Jeet Heer Dave Zirin Elie Mystal Chris Lehmann For four decades, this so-called liberal international order secured America’s position as global hegemon by convincing elites in other countries that they too could gain from free market reform, corporate power, political liberalization, and US suzerainty. But in part because the system failed an increasingly large number of Americans and in part because it constrained the naked exercise of force, the Trump administration now aims to eradicate it. Chinese leaders may be perfectly happy to see hypocritical American paeans to democracy and the rule of law despoiled. The danger is that those same leaders are deeply invested in other core institutions of the system—those parts that secure stability for commerce, promote economic development, and legitimize governing elites. Contrary to the portrayal that dominates DC thinking, in which China is thought to be bent on destroying the rules-based international order so that it can bully weaker countries for gain, China is in fact a cautious and conservative status quo power. It is hostile to those parts of the global system that undermine the political regime’s claims or that represent the unilateral use of force, but the rules of world trade, the prerogatives of state sovereignty, the smooth operation of multilateral institutions to address transnational problems, and the right to development for every country are all basic commitments in state policy. The official line that Chinese foreign policy seeks “win-win cooperation” is based on the (often unreliable) assumption that all these principles are mutually beneficial. Polemical depictions of China come much closer to describing the aims of Trump’s foreign policy than Xi Jinping’s. Ironically, the Trump administration might accept the DC portrayal of Chinese goals as accurate but unobjectionable—surely all great powers would squeeze their neighbors if the artificial constraints of global order were removed. They may believe that they can make Beijing an attractive offer: no longer trying to cut China out of the system and instead simply destroying the system, after which the great powers will be free to work out among themselves how to divide the spoils. If the United States builds an exclusionary sphere of interest in the Western Hemisphere, China could make peace with that because it could prey on countries in its own sphere to make up for lost tribute. We do not know whether anyone in the administration has gone this far in working out the consequences of their current path. But the logic of US actions is great-power predation pushing in the direction of closed imperial blocs. Such an outcome is a nonstarter with China—not just because Beijing would not trust the US to leave it enough space for its own depredations, but because it considers parts of the liberal international order crucial to its own success.

From optimizing the online booking experience to remain competitive with OTAs to valuing the guest’s time at check-in and being smart about upsells, Bashar explains why it’s all about the human connection and meeting your guests’ needs. Bashar also advocates for using technology as a tool to eliminate friction in every stage of the guest journey, so that hoteliers can focus on ultra-personalization that inspires guest loyalty. Tune in and find out if your guests are leaving your hotel without a true connection to your brand, and what you can do to become memorable. As Chief Marketing Officer at Revinate, Karen Stephens is focused on driving long-term growth by building Revinate’s brand equity, product marketing, and customer acquisition strategies. Her deep connections with hospitality industry leaders play a key role in crafting strategic partnerships. Karen is also the host of The Hotel Moment Podcast, where she interviews top players in the hospitality industry. Karen has been with Revinate for over 11 years, leading Revinate’s global GTM teams. Her most recent transition was from Chief Revenue Officer, where she led the team in their highest booking quarter to date in Q4 2023. Karen has more than 25 years of expertise in global hospitality technology and online distribution — including managing global accounts in travel and hospitality organizations such as Travelocity and lastminute.com Bashar Wali – 00:00:00: If I don’t connect with you, you’re just a place. I walk in, I walk out, I get what I need, I move on. Karen Stephens – 00:00:08: Welcome to the Hotel Moment Podcast presented by Revinate, the podcast where we discuss how hotel technology shapes every moment of the hotelier’s experience. Tune in as we explore the cutting edge technology transforming the hospitality industry and hear from experts and visionaries shaping the future of guest experiences. Whether you’re a hotelier or a tech enthusiast, you’re in the right place. Let’s dive in and discover how we can elevate the art of hospitality together. Karen Stephens – 00:00:36: Hello, and welcome to the Hotel Moment Podcast. I am your host, Karen Stephens, the Chief Marketing Officer of Revinate. And today we are thrilled to have Bashar Wali with us, the founder and CEO of Practice Hospitality and This Assembly, which is a group of hospitality service companies that includes Practice Hospitality. With over three decades of experience in the hospitality industry, Bashar has been at the forefront of creating innovative and human-centered hotel experiences. He is passionate about blending creative design, community engagement, and exceptional service to elevate the guest experience. From leading renowned properties like Providence hotels to founding his own companies, Bashar’s approach to hospitality is all about connecting people on a deeper level. So I have to say, if you haven’t had a conversation with Bashar before, you are really in for a treat. He’s got a great lens, as he even self-described, kind of born and raised in hotels and came up in the industry. And his take on where we are as a service industry in terms of how we relate to retail, the airlines, and what we can do better to improve connections with guests and build that trust is really phenomenal. So I think you’re going to laugh. I did a few times. He’s got some great commentary. So here you go, Bashar Wali. Hello, Bashar. Welcome to the podcast. Bashar Wali – 00:01:54: Karen, nice to see you. Delighted to be here with you. So Bashar, Karen Stephens – 00:01:57: You’ve been part of the hospitality industry for decades, and you’ve played a key role in creating unique and immersive hotel experiences. What drives you in the hospitality space, and what excites you most about where the industry is headed? Bashar Wali – 00:02:10: I wish I were that smart to agree with what you said about me. I tell people I’m just a hotel guy trying to do good work, and I really think of our industry as a ultra-simple industry at the end of the day. We’re not curing cancer. There’s no rocket science anywhere here. I feel passion is the singular, most underrated thing people think about when they think about our industry. I can teach you how to do all the things. I could show you how to push the buttons and move things around. I cannot teach you to be passionate about what you do. And unless you really have that fire within, this is not an industry for you. So for me, passion is what drives me, what motivates me, what keeps me going. And looking at human behavior, rather than trends, has been a pillar to everything I do. And what I mean by that is, I think people chase trends, and trends by definition have a shelf life. I say, I look at how humans behave, meaning how they interact with our spaces, how they interact with each other, what their eating trends look like, drinking trends look like, and I try to cater things and craft things to meet their expectations of how they live today. Again, just the way people eat, this idea of food allergies. You can’t exist today without thinking about those. But if you thought about those early enough, you became the go-to. You created loyalty. Because I say, Karen, I have gluten-free. Before gluten-free was a thing. I care about you. I see you. You matter to me. So it’s a nuanced approach that allows you to connect with people and make them feel cared for. That’s really the business we’re in, is making you feel cared for without chasing trends, without shocking on. Now, what I look to for inspiration, sadly, we’ve become a copy-paste industry. I no longer look at hospitality for inspiration. I forever said I’ve always looked at retail for inspiration. And the reason why I think retail specifically is because retail was at the verge of death and necessity is the mother of all invention. So they’ve had to really think about how do we actually change the narrative? How do we keep retail alive? And they’ve managed to understand that retail is not about transaction. Sure, it’s all about transaction, but that’s not how you attract people to you. It’s really about experiences. So you walk into retail stores. Now, everybody has activations and things and bells and whistles. So it’s less about buying the product and more about creating loyalty between you and the brand. So I definitely look at retail. I love their ease of use. I go on Instagram. I see a pair of shoes. I press three buttons. They’re in the mail coming my way. I go on a hotel website to book a room and on step 75, they’re making me change my keyboard from alpha to numerical to give them my zip code. Why in God’s name do you need my zip code? Why does it matter? Right? So it’s funny. We’re very archaic that way. And retail. Retail has leaps and bounds past us. So, yeah, I don’t look at hotels for inspiration anymore. I really look at other industries. Karen Stephens – 00:04:56: That’s really interesting. I love that correlation because I do think in hospitality, we always seem to be a little bit behind the curve and I think you hit it on the head. It’s like, how do you really connect with the guests? And it is about how somebody feels both about your brand and your website and also how they get on property. So can you talk a little bit about the ventures you’re involved in now? So there’s This Assembly and also Practice Hospitality. But how did those two work together to help hoteliers kind of achieve that feeling, for lack of a better word? Bashar Wali – 00:05:24: So we’re trying to organize it better. I know it’s by design been confusing. And frankly, I posted something recently on LinkedIn that I love the fact that many, many people that I know know me and I admire them and they admire me don’t know what I do. And it’s a little philosophical here because I say, look, what I do is not who I am. Who I am is who I am. What I do is secondary. So I love that fact. They sort of say hotel guy. We don’t know if he’s a trust fund kid who loves to loves to stay in hotels or he’s a doorman who works in hotels. And I love that. But to simplify, this assembly was designed to assemble a bunch of amazing people doing amazing things under one umbrella. And that’s what I’m trying to do now. So Practice Hospitality is a hotel management company. I will have the company that does sort of real estate development syndication advisory that will sit under that umbrella. We’re currently thinking about a couple of other ventures that would fit in that category. Ultimately, I want to be your, go-to guy. Hotel guy. Like everybody’s got a guy. I want to be your guy. When someone says, hey, I have this fill in the blank hospitality problem, Karen, I want you to say, I got a guy and kind of fill in the blank. Now, Jack of all trades, master of none, our specialty release sort of lifestyle, how to create places that matter and are memorable. I sort of say from my neurotic jumping around from hotel to hotel, there’s two kinds of hotels in the world. Only two. I don’t care about your Michelin keys and your stars and your diamonds. You’re either memorable. Or you’re forgettable. That’s it. Nothing else matters. I like to say we’re in that memorable hotel space. You can call it lifestyle. You can call it indie. You can go to a boutique. You can label it. However you want to label it. Those are nothing but labels. We’re in the business of when you walk into a place, making you feel a certain way that stays with you and you take it home with you. That’s all I want. And by the way, that could be two star or seven star. It really is not about stars. It’s about what you bring home. Karen Stephens – 00:07:15: Yeah, so I’ve actually heard you say along those lines, it’s that service is what you provide and hospitality is how you make people feel. So that’s kind of a summary of what you just said. Bashar Wali – 00:07:24: 100%. Karen Stephens – 00:07:25: Okay, so how do hotels balance high-tech innovation and with creating that emotional connection? So how do you foster that on property using technology as well? Bashar Wali – 00:07:35: I literally was having this conversation this morning using the airline business as an example. The airlines were masters of eliminating the bodies in the front and pushing you towards the app and the kiosk. They were masters at it. But the one thing they have that we don’t have is once I do all my things on my phone, I book my reservations, I check in, I change my seat, I do all the things. They remove the friction. I no longer need to call or go in a line for an hour to check in at the airport. But what the airlines have that we don’t have is now I’m stuck on that tin can in the air for one, two, 10 hours, and they can engage with me one-on-one. They can provide me service. They can get me to join their tribe by recruiting me, by providing me good service. Not many of them anymore, sadly, particularly in the US, but certainly internationally, they understand that concept. The problem with hotels following that model is, and I’ve used it before, I could literally engage with a hotel the same exact way and never meet a human in the process. Airplane, I’m checking in, I get in my Uber, I walk in the lobby, just zip through the lobby, go on the elevator, open my room, get in my room, get out of my room, leave, check out, never engage with someone. And what a missed opportunity. Because what you’ve done now is you’ve become a commodity. I need a bed and a shower, you give me a bed and a shower. There’s nothing more about it. How do you make a room memorable? A room is not memorable. Marble is not memorable. Art is not memorable. It’s really the people that make those things memorable. It’s not about the art. It’s about the artist who created the art and what was going on in their heart and soul and brain that makes the art more valuable. Even if it’s so abstract, even if it’s paint thrown on a canvas, if you really understand how we came together and engage with that artist indirectly through a curator, through a docent, through something, that’s why the art matters. So I think the danger for us is following the airline model without having that piece where I can connect with you. So my view on technology is we are dinosaurs. We hotels are absolute dinosaurs. Again, back to my example of the booking engine. Hotel people, I love you. I do not want to go to the OTAs to book my room. Please don’t fight me every step of the way when I’m trying to book my room on your website. Make it easy for me. Because by step 75, if you are making me change my keyboard from numerical to alpha, guess what I’m doing? I’m going to Expedia, sorry. One, two, three, room book. We are dinosaurs when it comes to technology. We have a great opportunity to adapt. Be fast at it because we are historically dinosaurs. Remove the friction. My view on technology is its job is to remove the friction. So when I walk up to you at the desk, Karen, don’t ask me to sign here and initial there and stick my credit card here and show you this and do that. The airlines have figured out to remove all of that. Why haven’t we? Allow me at that moment in time when I come up to you at the desk to ask you, what’s your favorite FOSS spot in town? What should I do? What’s around the corner? How do I do this? How do I get that? Like, allow me to engage with you. Because, and I talk about this a lot in Nazi and frankly, everyone who follows me will be like, oh God, here he goes again. I’m going Darwinian on you. You ready? Karen Stephens – 00:10:31: Yeah. Bashar Wali – 00:10:32: We are tribal animals. We need each other to survive. We have not evolved enough past that yet. Maybe someday we will. But right now we all want to feel like we belong. And when you remove the humans out of the transaction, you are shelter. You are providing me the very lowest thing on Maslow’s hierarchy of need that we human needs. We all need shelter. And if you are just shelter to me, man, that is an expensive way to sleep for one night, paying you four, five, eight, nine thousand dollars. If you don’t give me a reason to say, oh, this is my place. I belong here. Sure, I’ll admire your design and your art and your scent and your lighting. All these are important. But ultimately, in my opinion, if I don’t connect with you, you’re just a place. I walk in, I walk out, I get what I need, I move on. So we are not using technology enough to remove friction. We still have a lot of friction points. And by the way, another interesting thing is I tell people, you’re badly mistaken if you think you are in any other business other than retail. You are retailers. Hoteliers, you are retailers. You have perishable inventory. If you don’t sell that room tonight, it is gone forever. You can’t resell it tomorrow. So don’t fight me when I’m trying to buy from you. Allow me to buy seamlessly and then find a hook for me to become loyal to you so I’m not shopping anyone else. Karen Stephens – 00:11:41: Yeah. Can you give an example? So again, if we’re removing the friction and making the booking easier, making the experience and check-in easier, can you share an example of how a hotel experience can foster deeper connection or how humans in the loop can make sure that that happens to create that loyalty and that impact? Bashar Wali – 00:11:58: And again, I feel like I’m sick and tired of hearing myself tell the same stories again. I’ll give you an example I use often. Back to the airline business. Status on Delta, top status. I walk up to the gate. I look on the screen. I see my name at the top of the screen for the upgrade. Sure, I’ll take your upgrade. I’m not complaining. But my brain says, wait a minute. Bashar didn’t get an upgrade. I’m nobody. I don’t matter to them. I’m a record number. Record number 5789 that flew this many miles, that has this much status, that bought the ticket at this time, gets to the top of the upgrade. I’ll take your upgrade. But that doesn’t push that button in me that says, hey, you’re important. You matter. And we all want that. We all desperately want that. We desperately want to matter. Back to Maslow’s hierarchy of need, triangle, bottom is shelter, oxygen, water. The very top is transcendence and self-actualization. And self-actualization to me means, Aaron, you see me. I matter to you, right? That’s what hits that button that I’ve arrived. Now I’m at the peak of my species. So I get on the plane. I got the upgrade. Great, fine. I didn’t get the upgrade. The record got the upgrade. I paid my dues to get that upgrade. You didn’t do it for me. Sitting on that plane, I get a handwritten postcard from the pilot that says, dear Mr. Wali, thank you for being a million miler. Thank you for continuing to fly with us through the pandemic. You’re the reason we fly. I am king of the world. I am blown away. So in hotels to be more tactical and kind of stop being so philosophical and nebulous, if you want to accomplish that same idea, to me, the future of luxury is ultra personalization. Forget what color M&M I want on my pillows. That’s so true. Trivial and inconsequential. I’ll give you an example. I’m top status on Marriott. I’ve stayed in hundreds of Marriotts across the globe. Hundreds. I like my room 64 degrees year round. You would think once someone says, hey, we know this customer is a good customer. 20% of your customers give you 80% of your business. We should know that he likes his room cold. I’m going to push a button because technology allows us to do that. I don’t even need to go to the room anymore. Energy management system to drop the temperature for him and take credit for it. Leave a little note that says, hey, we know you like your room more temperature. You’re all set. Hope you enjoy it. Because that wins my loyalty. Not your damn points. Because points are not loyalty. Points are bribery. Come stay at my hotel. I will give you a point. If I stop giving you points, are you still coming? No, that’s not loyalty. I’m buying your loyalty, not earning it. So I think there are a lot of simple ways. But to me, really, it is about ultra customization. And that could mean, by the way, let’s be clear. The biggest luxury for me, single biggest luxury is time. We just don’t have enough of it. So if you want to give me luxury, don’t waste my time. So that may mean I don’t want to talk to you. I don’t want to engage with you. I want to choose to. Don’t force me to. So when I show up at 11 p.m. to check in for a one night stay, you know, I’m leaving at seven. Why are you telling me about the spa? Does it look like I care about your spa or your gym? So those to me are honestly emotional intelligence at the end of the day is where it boils down to. If we can focus enough on helping our team learn and foster emotional intelligence, read the room, read your customer. I don’t need ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen. I’m not a gentleman. Don’t call me by my last name. Don’t send me a butler. Give me what I need. So I tell people when I interview people. And by the way, I have a bunch of jobs open. We have new hotels opening. I don’t care about your Cornell. I don’t care about your whatever. I care that you have common sense, which is very uncommon and have emotional intelligence. People, we are not curing cancer. This is not that hard. All you have to do is be nice and read the room. That’s it. Kind of like at home. When you have company at home, read the room, Karen. If the music’s too loud, read the room. Turn the music down. Right? Like it’s so simple, yet so hard. Karen Stephens – 00:15:34: I love that. I’m over here laughing. It’s so true. I think the other thing that really hit for me. So first of all, ultra personalization. Yes. And then the second thing is and take credit for it. In other words, you don’t have to be like, you know, but just a little note in the room. Bashar Wali – 00:15:49: Take credit for it. Karen Stephens – 00:15:50: Yeah. It’s a morgue temperature in here on purpose. Bashar Wali – 00:15:53: Absolutely. Take credit for it. The other piece I’ll touch on on technology. Again, look at retail, right? Like I mean, look at Amazon and Instagram and you don’t even have to say it anymore. You think about it and it shows up. Like I feel that if we wanted to, we have the ability to. Karen, I can for very little money tell you how many times you went to the bathroom in your room, how long your shower was, whether you flushed the toilet or not, whether you washed your hands after you’ve used the toilet or not. We can dig so deep in on you to really get to know you. I am shocked. And maybe I’m wrong. And if someone thinks I’m wrong, please correct. That Marriott, the largest, doesn’t have an entire department with a bunch of MIT PhDs that are data scientists that are saying, okay, what can we learn about Karen and how do we put it to work to her benefit? Not big brother, not breaching any privacy issues. I know there’s a lot of people concerned about that. But for example, I have a routine, right? Business traveler. I walk in the room. There are five things I do every time. So if you know that every time I walk in the room, I turn the temperature down and I put the TV on, pick a channel, CNN. Think how magical that would be for me. To arrive in the room, have the temperature be down and the TV be on CNN. Because now I’m loyal to you. You know me, you get me. But nobody thinks about loyalty in that lens. We keep thinking about bribery, throw points at them, extra points. Oh, great. So that’s where the magic is lost. But you make a good point about take credit for it. Because if I don’t know, I won’t know. I’ll assume it’s a coincidence. Maybe, oh, they put the TV on CNN. It happens to be what I watch. Great. But if you say, hey, not to every guest, by the way, you’re a thousand room hotels. You’re not sending a thousand handwritten notes. And by the way, for those who don’t know, you literally can buy a machine, a robotic machine that has a pen, not super expensive, that will write handwritten notes for you. So you can’t write a thousand notes handwritten with a pen. But take credit for it. Because taking credit for it is your way of showing me love and showing me that you care about me. Karen Stephens – 00:17:42: Yeah, that’s amazing. The other thing I want to pick up on is just talking about points, even in the airline or with hotel. It’s like you earn those points because you’re on those planes all the time, in those rooms all the time. So that’s not a reward for me. That’s a road warrior. You know, that’s something in my career that makes me be here all the time. Bashar Wali – 00:18:00: It’s the price of admission, right? Like it is the price of admission. And funny, by the way, you see those who get it, they’ll show up at an independent hotel with no points. They’ll open their wallet and there’ll be every top status card in their wallet that you see. They’re not choosing you for the points. Again, listen, and we’ll talk about the other kind of a traveler in a minute. But those who are seeking the experiences, they’re not choosing you for the points. But if you give them the points, sure, they’ll take it. But they’re not gonna sacrifice the experience for the points. So if you happen to have a good experience and you give them points, okay, great, bonus. But that’s not what they’re coming there for. Now, in fairness, there’s a lot of hardworking people out there who are barely making it, who will go out of their way to a lesser experience to get the points because that’s how they take their family on vacation. I am not knocking those people. But they are doing that consciously and they’re doing thoughtfully for a reason. So no knock on those point chasers because I get why they’re doing it. But if you’re touting your ability to attract people based on experience, my argument is you don’t need points. Karen Stephens – 00:19:00: Well, we talk about this a lot at Revinate. We deal with a lot of independent hotels and small groups. And it is about the experience and tailoring that experience and making sure that people understand even beyond the hotel, what’s in the local area that’s going to enrich your whole stay. So we think about that a lot. Because if you don’t have 30,000 rooms, points really don’t. It takes a long time to do. Bashar Wali – 00:19:22: And we talk a lot about CRM, and I think people throw that word around and they don’t know what it means anymore. CRM isn’t sending a guest an email to have them come back and stay. It’s a complex journey from beginning to end to build customer relationship management. Relationship. We think about it transaction. I have a need period. I’m going to send you an email to come stay with me. That’s not relationship nurturing. Relationship nurturing is having a dialogue with you ongoing in any different way, whatever that means, a newsletter or whatever. It’s not always about look at me, look at me, come by me, come by me. So I think we need to better define CRM in our industry broadly and what it means back to this ultra customization issue. Also, we back to again, Marriott to pick on them for a minute. You should know everything about me, but what are you doing with that information? Nothing. As far as I’m concerned, nothing. And by the way, the same example I gave you about the upgrade on Delta. I mean, I’m a hotel ops guy. I grew up in the business. When you get an amenity in the room, Karen, don’t get excited. I don’t know who you are. You’re just a name on a list. I print a list that says, here are the VIPs. Karen is VIP level one. You send her this amenity. So it’s very impersonal unless it is personal where someone found out something about you, knew you liked, how do you do melon or whatever? I wrote you a note to take credit for it. Hey, this is not just an amenity that everyone gets. Karen, we know you like honeydew and we sent you honeydew specifically because then it’s not an amenity. Then it’s like, holy crap. I love these people. How did they know that about me? Karen Stephens – 00:20:41: Yeah, it really does feel like that too. I admit it. Bashar Wali – 00:20:45: Transactional, all transactional. Karen Stephens – 00:20:47: Right? That’s so true. Okay. You mentioned Instagram. So let’s talk a little bit about the Instagramification of hotels. How do you think this trend is shaping how hotels market themselves and what should hotels be doing to tell their brand story more effectively using digital? Bashar Wali – 00:21:02: As I vomit in my mouth at the very thought of Instagrammable moments. So I often say, do good work. Funny, I tell designers, if you win an award for doing this project for me, I will never hire you again because now the award is the only thing you’re thinking about. So you will do things that make no sense, that have no basis. And in reality, because you’re chasing that nebulous award. What I say is do good work and the award will come. And similarly, do thoughtful things that naturally become Instagrammable moment. Don’t go put a sign on the world, a wall that says, this must be the place you have arrived. La la la la. Like we’ve seen them all now. And when cool becomes ubiquitous, it’s not cool anymore. When there’s a checklist on how to be cool, that is the definition of being uncool. Do not follow that checklist. So this never ending Instagrammable moment, has become almost our purpose and our North Star to a fault. It makes no sense. Sometimes what we do with it as no context, it has no basis. If you are thoughtful about what you do, I love those two words, thoughtful and intentional. Don’t just put a piece of art on the wall because it’s a good piece of art. Make sure it resonates. It has meaning. It has purpose specifically. And the way you could tell your story through digital, which is super important, obviously, and I’ll give you a real life example in a minute is make sure that the work that. You’re doing to tell the story has those moments of surprise and delight. I hate that term too. It’s very hotel nineties. But the idea is like, if you’re trying to tell me a story about this historic building or this location or this market or this destination or these people or whatever it is that you’re celebrating or this forest or this river, find a moment that’s interesting. That’s elegant, intentional, and thoughtful that you believe will naturally become the Instagrammable moment. Don’t start the process by saying, let’s find the Instagrammable moment out of this thing and put it on the wall. We’ve story. And you know, when you’re reading a book and there’s a, maybe an illustration that’s beautiful and it grabs your attention. That’s how I think of it. But that illustration is a part of the story. It’s not just some random thing thrown on a wall that has no context whatsoever to the story. So that’s how I think about Instagrammable moments. They are important. We have to use digital. The example I was gonna give you is I take my kids on separate trips every spring break across the globe, one-on-one and often I’m the neurotic hotel guy. I’m gonna pick the hotel. So last time I went with. My daughter, seven countries in 10 days, literally I said, you’re in charge. You go find the hotels. Here’s your parameters. Here’s the budget. Here’s the quality, et cetera. Don’t tell me. And I promise, cuz I’m known to be whiny a lot about that stuff. I’m like, I will shut my mouth and I will accept it. Literally every hotel she picked in seven countries across the globe that we’ve never been to, except for one I had been to were spectacular. I would have never found them. And she found them all on TikTok. So dear hoteliers. Sure. It’s nice to be in The New York Times. So. I can go to a cocktail party and brag to my friends that my hotel made it in The New York Times. That’s not how people are buying today. If you’re not on digital and all in on digital, you are asleep at the week. You’re the guy who back in the nineties said, oh, that internet thing is a fad. It’ll go away. The future is short videos, real time user generated. It can’t all be shiny influencer, sexy bikini. That kind of like early on when we, the TripAdvisor, right? Like it was so good cuz it was user generated. You could rely and trust it. People are far more sophisticated now and they can read through the BS that we might serve them. So it has to be authentic, but that’s where the future is. And you have to create places in your hotel that are a conducive for these customers that are paying you to help you tell your story for free. They’re doing your marketing for you. Don’t get in their way. Let them walk around with their selfie sticks. Let them have the right, proper lighting. Make sure your wifi is fast enough. That’s how you foster those people to allow them to come brand evangelists for you across the globe. But absolutely the future, a hundred percent across the spectrum from luxury to select serve is digital. Like got email who opens email and reads email anymore. Are you kidding me? But it has to be, it can’t be, oh, let’s do a reel for TikTok tomorrow. No, no, no, no. It has to be a bonafide, well thought out, thoughtful and intentional strategy. That is a long-term strategy. It’s all let’s spend a thousand dollars on TikTok next month. Oh, we got no money out of it. Forget to no, no, no, no. It has to be part of your marketing plan. Karen Stephens – 00:25:20: I love that because I do think that kind of the old way of thinking is what is our social media strategy? We’re going to do X amount of posts per week. We’re going to blah, blah, blah, blah. And what I’m hearing you say is create the environment and the experience. And obviously your hotel has to be great. And then those guests are going to come in and they will do your marketing for you, especially the younger generations, right? I was skiing the other weekend and there was a guy at the top of the mountain, you know, had his whole coat off taking pictures with the lake behind. I mean, it was like, what is going on? But I just realized, hey, that’s a generational thing. And they’re the new buyers. Like I’m reading the The New York Times. They’re looking at TikTok. Bashar Wali – 00:25:59: And they’re influencing their parents, also the younger ones. Like, by the way, Karen, you think you’re the decision maker? You’re not. You’re gonna listen to those kids. They’re gonna influence their decision-making for you. And to your point, let the consumers do the hard work for you, but you still have to have your own strategy. And of course, influencers are very important. And I think influencers, it’s become a dirty word almost, but those that are good at it and know what they’re doing are very accretive and valuable. But we also get caught up in the ROI. And I get it. I’m an owner and an operator in some cases. We all want ROI. But you can’t spend a dollar on Instagram and expect to get $7 back because there’s this idea of brand recognition. Why does AT&T pay 40 million bucks to put their name on a stadium? They’re not saying, how many more phones or plans have we sold as a result of this? They’re saying, we want our name to be front and center. So I think of those campaigns as two separate ones. There’s the name recognition that you can’t put an ROI on because it’s a long-term brand strategy. Then there’s the direct campaign. I have a sneak period. I want to succinctly do a campaign to generate traffic to this hotel during that period. What do I do? And you can’t do it the day before. Like this again, has to be a strategy in place, kind of like sales plans and marketing plans. You created the beginning of the year. 90% of them sit on a shelf and nobody looks at them ever again. It has to be a living documents that changes every day because habits change, platforms change, and timing and need periods change. And I think we’re not using digital enough because sadly, the industry is dominated by middle-aged white dudes and they all want to be in the The New York Times and they all want to be in that whatever. I would much rather be mentioned in Goop than be in the The New York Times. I mean, that’s again, we’ve got to shed the old thinking. I call us the middle-aged white dudes, not white, but the double-breasted shiny suit guys who still think that thing is in style. Although maybe it is coming back now. Like we’ve got to shed the notion that we know everything and really listen and learn because we do not know everything. And if you think you know everything today, literally go home and retire because you’re dead. You’re going to be a has-been and so fast, you won’t know what hit you. You’ll be five minutes ago. We have to pay attention to what’s happening in real time. And things change so fast today. Back in the old days, think about revenue management. Back in the old days, you met once a month, you set the rates for the month and that was it. You’re done with revenue management. Now it’s like a stock market ticker. You have to watch it like a hawk and yield and how you yield those rooms. There’s talk now of Karen, if you want to sit in the restaurant at the table by the window at 7 p.m. on a Saturday, the menu is dynamic. The menu prices will change because the idea is you want premium and that’s where technology can help you maximize your returns, be agile and nimble because how do I do that now? Print different menus for different hours for different tables. But whether it’s a QR code, which by the way, I hate it’s that the QR codes are over, but there are a lot of ways to create dynamic pricing across all things we do to allow us to maximize. And by the way, allow Karen who can’t afford this restaurant at 7 p.m. On a Saturday to come at 5 p.m. On a Monday and get a really good deal. So it’s good for us for maximizing our revenue and it’s good for the consumer because now they could choose what their budget is and what fits in that budget. Karen Stephens – 00:29:10: Right. Wow, that’s fascinating. I think digital strategy, we talk about this a lot, the long game and the short game. And again, that’s kind of borrowed from retail and traditional marketers. But hoteliers need to think of that as well. Brand building is not a short term activity. It does not have ROI out the gate. It’s something that, that goes over time. I’m telling you, my VP of marketing right now is jumping up and down because we talk about this all the time. Bashar Wali – 00:29:32: Well, again, and what I said to you earlier is we don’t think we’re retailers and we really need to change that narrative. We say, oh, we’re in the guest service business. No, no, no. Guest service is what you do to make what you make at the end of the day work. Your job is to sell those rooms day in and day out. That’s the only job you have. Karen Stephens – 00:29:49: Right. Okay, so I have one last question for you. So as a hotel operator, as someone who’s been in the business, has owned a lot of hotels, has had different brands and now with the two companies you’re with now, there’s a lot that hotel operators are dealing with. And what is your piece of advice? I mean, if you just think about the context that we’ve already got staffing shortages, costs are just going up, up, up. So I feel like the struggle for an operator at this point is to figure out how to do all of these things and stay alive. Maybe that’s dramatic, but one piece of advice for operators. Bashar Wali – 00:30:18: I wish I’d give it to myself if I had it. I mean, look, fundamentally, I am a true believer in the hire people that are smarter than you are and get out of their way. And that’s becoming harder and harder to your point about the labor market and now the immigration issue and deportation issue and how that affects our industry, et cetera. It has been a really, really rough go for us. Prices continue to go up. Margins continue to get squeezed. The big get bigger and make it harder for us little guys to kind of go chase it. I hate this idea of us being service providers, view the service provider. Karen, if you own a hotel, me being your service provider is very transactional. You’re hiring me to provide you a service and you’re paying me a fee for it. I think we’ve forgotten the idea that the way for this to be successful for both of us, this is a relationship. This is a partnership. I want to be your partner, your owner. I don’t want to be your service provider because by being your partner, it changes our collective perspective. We’re at the table together. Your concerns are mine. I’m helping you think your concerns. You’re invested in my success because my success is your success. I feel like there’s a lot of tension now between owner and operator. It always seems like it’s a fight. And I think the best example, obviously, is when you are the owner and the operator because now you control everything. But in the example where you are a service provider, our services become commoditized in a way by the big boys that have 1,500 hotels and will do it on a month-to-month basis for nothing, basically. If you want those guys, you can have them. They’re going to be your service provider. My advice to people in my space is you have to be a partner to your owner. You have to understand their hopes, their aspirations. You have to set their expectations realistically from the get-go. Don’t over-promise and under-deliver. And don’t under-promise and over-deliver. Really, it’s kind of like a marriage or any relationship, for that matter. I think any relationship has to be built on the foundation of trust. If you don’t have trust, you have nothing. So we don’t spend enough time really getting to know our customers, our partners, our owners, establishing that trust relationship. But make no mistake about it, a good friend of mine described this management business as a knife fight out there, and it is a knife fight. At the end of the day, care and owner, if you’re a partner, if you want the commodity person, I’m not your person, I will make you connections to lots of people who will do it cheaper, faster. It just depends on what you want, and that might be the answer for you. But if you really want a partner, here, I’ll give you the silly analogy I use. You and your spouse are trying to have kids. It’s hard, hard, hard, hard. Finally, after years and hundreds of thousands of dollars, you have your baby. Blood, sweat, tears, money. Because that’s what hotels are to many developers. They’re not transactional. They’re passion, they’re children. And now you and your spouse want to go out to dinner. So you’re like, well, what do I do with the baby? Do you hire someone to manage your baby? Is that what you do? Manage is such a passive, transactional word. And that’s how we viewed it. So now my example now, you have this hotel, blood, sweat, and tears. You’ve agonized for months over what feeling that doorknob will give you when you open it, how tactile it is. And you’re going to give it to someone to manage? So the words I’d like to use back to the baby context is, you want someone to love, care for, nourish, nurture your baby. If you don’t think about it in those lens, and if I don’t think about it in that lens that you’re handing me your baby that I should love and cherish and grow, it’s transactional. I’m just managing your baby. I mean, think about literally that terminology. So I think, again, we’ve gone away from that whole inner person. Chip Conley was a genius at this with Joie de Vivre. His job wasn’t running hotels. His job was really engaging the owners. The owners didn’t hire J.D. Vitor on their hotels. They hired Chip Conley. Chip Conley knew their kids. He took them out to baseball games. He was a friend. He was their partner. And that’s why those relationships were successful because they were all built on this interpersonal thing and not just transactional. So if there’s any piece of advice I will give you is if you think of yourself as a service provider, I get paid to do the job, then fine, there’s a place for you. But if you really want to do something unique and different is you have to think about this as a partnership, a marriage, a relationship, and nurture it. You can’t just take it for granted. You can’t get the deal, send the show pony in to get the deal and walk away. It’s like any relationship. You have to continue to nurture and water it and feed it and take care of it for it to thrive. Karen Stephens – 00:34:27: I love it. Well, thank you, Bashar. I really appreciate the conversation. Bashar Wali – 00:34:31: Thank you. Delighted to be with you.

Title: VanEck Seeks BNB ETF Approval—Big Win For Binance?

Investment giant VanEck has registered a Binance Coin (BNB) exchange-traded fund in Delaware, marking its fifth cryptocurrency ETF registration in the state. The move comes as major financial institutions continue to bet on digital assets despite market volatility. According to public records on Delaware’s official state website, VanEck registered the new product on Monday under filing number 10148820. The “VanEck BNB ETF” was registered as a trust corporate service company, following similar registrations for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche ETFs. The New York-based company confirmed the BNB ETF will track the price of Binance Coin, currently ranked as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market value of approximately $599. On-chain data showed BNB’s trading volume jumped 40% to over $2 billion after the announcement. VanEck’s filing represents the first attempt to create a Binance Coin ETF specifically for US investors. While other BNB-related products exist in global markets, such as the 21Shares Binance ETP, none are based in the United States. The 21Shares product remains the only exchange-traded note tracking the Binance Coin index. JUST IN: VanEck Registers Entity for Potential First BNB ETF in the U.S. VanEck has filed in Delaware to register an entity, hinting at plans for the first-ever BNB ETF in the U.S. market. The move marks a significant step towards expanding the accessibility of Binance Coin… pic.twitter.com/iFXBVu4mkD — Crypto Town Hall (@Crypto_TownHall) April 2, 2025 The registration follows VanEck’s successful launches of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year after securing Securities and Exchange Commission approval. The company manages nearly $115 billion in client assets globally. “VanEck seems to be taking a ‘throw everything at the wall and see what sticks’ approach, which makes sense,” said Sumit Roy, senior ETF analyst at etf.com. “Avalanche isn’t the most widely traded cryptocurrency, but being first to market with an ETF in a new category comes with potential upside and little downside.” The move comes just weeks after VanEck applied for SEC approval to launch the first AVAX ETF. Based on reports from Delaware’s state website, that document was registered under file number 10125689. VanEck isn’t alone in pursuing alternative cryptocurrency ETFs. Grayscale has also applied to launch funds based on XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin. The firm’s Bitcoin fund currently manages nearly $17 billion and ranks third among Bitcoin funds from companies like BlackRock and Fidelity. The surge in ETF applications follows the strong performance of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds in 2023. Crypto-based exchange-traded products have drawn approximately $44 billion in assets during 2024 alone. The NASDAQ exchange also submitted an application to the SEC on March 28 to list shares of an Avalanche ETF issued by crypto asset manager Grayscale. According to filing documents, Grayscale’s AVAX fund would use Coinbase Custody as its custodian. VanEck’s latest move with BNB suggests major financial institutions see growing investor appetite for regulated cryptocurrency investment vehicles beyond just Bitcoin. The company filed for a Solana ETF in June 2024, making it the first potential SOL exchange-traded fund in the US. To gain official approval, VanEck must now file a formal S-1 form with the SEC for these newly registered crypto ETFs.

Title: Flying Astrobee Robots On ISS Augur Guardian Spacecraft Of The Future

ByKevin Holden Platt ByKevin Holden Platt, Contributor. ISS Commander Suni Williams helps test out an Astrobee free-flying robot, outfitted with mechanical ... More octopus tentacles to capture dead satellites and hyper-speed space debris, as she orbits the planet at 28,000 kilometers per hour. Free-flying Astrobee robots now being tested on the International Space Station could give rise to incredible guardian spacecraft that halo the ISS and protect it from super-speed shrapnel threatening the lives of all its astronauts. Three years after an exploding cloud of shards from a Russian anti-satellite missile - speeding toward the ISS at 28,000 kilometers per hour - sparked NASA to order the Station’s astronauts to seek refuge inside their escape capsules, leading robotics experts are conducting experiments that could one day lead to a futuristic defense against similar threats. A constellation of ISS spacefarers, including just-returned Station Commander Suni Williams, has been overseeing tactical demos of the fantastical bots. In their current configuration - resembling aliens that are part machine and part sea creature - they almost appear to have taken flight from a Transformers film, and from the future into the present age. The three Astrobees - identical triplets - launched to the orbital outpost started out their lives with a remarkably different mission, says Jonathan Barlow, who heads the Astrobee Project at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, the American space agency’s freewheeling fountainhead of invention and radical experimentation. Each Astrobee is outfitted with internal propellers to fly, along with three smartphone-class ARM processors and a suite of six imagers, including a high-resolution video camera and two leading-edge LIDAR time-of-flight sensors, that combined allow the airborne robot to map and navigate its surroundings. The International Space Station is a technological wonderland, and the globe's greatest platform to ... More conduct demos of next-generation space robots. (Photo by NASA/Space Frontiers/Getty Images) Initially, Barlow says, the highly autonomous Astrobees were designed as mobile cameramen that can glide across the Station and stop in mid-flight to film ISS astronauts, and as sophisticated platforms to host experiments devised by guest scientists across the outpost’s allies. Each floating robot can be operated by the NASA Ames Astrobee team, or by the ISS astronauts via their laptops, who can program hours-long sorties for them to fly through, or tele-operate the droids move by move. Barlow, a vanguard aerospace research engineer who helped develop the Astrobees and their Robot Operating System-derived software, tells me in an interview that his Intelligent Robotics Group at NASA Ames has joined forces with a dynamic space-tech outfit to transform the flying machines as precursors to a future stage of missions: capturing satellites that have exhausted their propellant or even out-of-control space debris that increasingly threatens the high-traffic rings of low Earth orbit. Inventors at this partner outfit - Kall Morris Inc - told me they’ve outfitted the Astrobees with next-generation biomimicry technology to empower the robots to capture free-floating space objects. They’ve engineered a complete metamorphosis of the ISS bots, which have been armed with an array of octopus-like tentacles, fitted with gecko-inspired adhesive pads, that can ensnare even spinning nanosatellites. This hybrid astro-octopus, they say, can now capture space objects measuring up to 6.5 meters in diameter - the size of the Webb Space Telescope’s mirror - adhere to it with gecko “clingers,” and propel it into an alternate flightpath. Fantastical Astrobee flying robots, enhanced with an array of octopus-like tentacles, practice ... More capturing simulated satellites floating across the Space Station. Starting last summer, onetime test pilot Suni Williams helped guide these Astrobees through a series of fascinating maneuvers as they chased and deftly captured simulated CubeSats floating across the Kibo module of the Station - all as forerunner flights to hyper-tech debris removal sorties in times ahead. Barlow’s team at NASA Ames, and his KMI partners, liaised in real-time with Williams, a former Space Shuttle astronaut, as she oversaw these demonstration flights 400 kilometers above the globe. So far, the enhanced Astrobees have already captured more than one hundred “target spacecraft” inside the Space Station, and a new sequence of these chase-and-seizure demos is slated to start in early April, just weeks after the arrival of a new contingent of ISS astronauts, says Troy Morris, who heads the Michigan-based KMI. Even as its cutting-edge robotics tech is tested across the microgravity platform of the ISS, Morris tells me, his skunkworks lab is developing a new spacecraft, called Laelaps, that will be equipped with more powerful Space Octopus features to rendezvous with and take control of dead satellites and spent rocket stages that now crisscross and threaten low Earth orbit. The robots and orbital flyers being developed by KMI are at the forefront of a nascent campaign - stretching from North America to Europe to Asia - to begin clearing heavily traveled orbital lanes of the spacecraft and shrapnel that could threaten future human spaceflight, the ISS and the space stations set to be lofted by independent aerospace operators. The Laelaps now being perfected by Morris’s group might one day be deployed like a celestial ring of protectors around the ISS, prepared to capture any debris - from missile fragments to castaway rockets - determined to be on a precise collision course with the Space Station. The immediate focus of his studio, Morris says, is on demonstrating autonomous docking with and relocation of orbiting satellites and spacecraft that have lost their ability to maneuver. A target CubeSat is captured by an Astrobee robot inside the Kibo module of the ISS Yet much more complicated, potentially live-saving missions are being mapped out for the future, he says: “The concept of deploying a fleet of autonomous satellites to safeguard critical infrastructure - such as the ISS - against collision threats is compelling and something we are exploring conceptually.” In a series of captivating papers, Morris and co-founders of KMI have pinpointed 198 rocket bodies, launched from the U.S. since the start of the Space Age and now spinning around the planet at up to 2000 kilometers in altitude, that would make optimum targets when the American government begins funding active debris removal operations. “The population of artificial objects in Earth orbit has increased steadily since humanity began utilizing the space environment decades ago,” Morris states in one study. “Currently the U.S. Air Force tracks over 44,000 objects larger than 10 centimeters in Earth orbit.” “Should these objects collide,” he adds, “debris clouds would form, setting off a domino effect of more collisions” in a potential orbital doomsday called the “Kessler Syndrome.” Meanwhile, as his robotic spacecraft advance their ability to intercept runaway space objects, Morris says, KMI could “provide our protective services to the ISS, other stations, and the growing needs of all space operators.” Back on the International Space Station, the re-engineered Astrobees are set to whiz through a new series of aerial war games, tracking and overpowering their hovering prey. After collaborating with iconic NASA aeronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on these zero-gravity exercises, Troy Morris says, his lab is set to team up with a new corps of ISS sojourners. Just-launched astronaut Anne McClain, who has extensive experience in drilling the Astrobees from an earlier trek to the space-lab, might be a strong candidate to lead the new round of tests with the revamped droids, Morris predicts. When asked if the future-tech progeny of the Astrobees might one day be deployed to shield human spacefarers, including those inside the colossal International Space Station, from incoming threats moving at hyper-speeds, Jonathan Barlow at NASA Ames says the potential to create robotic spacecraft acting as celestial sentinels “certainly seems like a cool idea.” “I think that something like that, you know, guardians outside of a space station could, yeah, could definitely happen.” Since being launched to the Station five years ago, Barlow says, the Astrobees have spearheaded a spectrum of breakthroughs - including advances in human-robot interactions by connecting up with astronauts and aerospace wunderkinds of the future. The space-bots have already generated circles of acolytes across American campuses, Barlow adds, via boosters like MIT’s Zero Robotics tournament, which challenges high school creatives to program Astrobees to race through a series of maneuvers with deftness and style. During the early rounds of these nationwide competitions, he says, would-be operators of the robots code them to speed across a simulated ISS. Yet the ultimate round - the championship - he adds, “is on ISS with real astronauts and real Astrobees.” Suni Williams lauds the tournament, and says she had a blast teaming up with students during the final Astrobee match on the Station. Iconic astronaut Suni Williams says she had a blast teaming up with young programmers competing to ... More maneuver the Astrobee robots across the ISS during the Zero Robotics championship staged by MIT During her first press conference back on terra firma this week, Williams suggested this orbital Olympics for aero-robots might also help NASA discover its astronauts, coders and inventors of the next generation. “We did lots of experiments up there with kids and universities,” she said, “and trying out new guidance and navigational control, and robots that were flying inside of the Space Station.” “That is pretty awesome that you can really touch and talk to kids on the ground as you are doing experiments up there.” “And they have their finger on the pulse of science experiments.” “And they can understand that,” the superstar astronaut added, “and think to themselves ‘I can be part of this someday.’”

Title: Ghost in the Machine: AI’s Verdict on AI Investing

AI has a presence in almost every aspect of modern life, from summarizing buyer responses on Amazon to working with radiologists to discover incipient tumors on scans. Few industries have been as anxiously vigilant on the subject as investment management. Increasingly, managers are relying on AI to do part of their work and, increasingly, they wonder if it could eventually replace them entirely. (Spoiler: quite possibly.) Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly permeated various aspects of human life, often in surprising ways. Here are three unexpected areas where AI plays a significant role. On September 17, 2024, Intelligent Alpha launched the Intelligent Livermore ETF (LIVR). It is a global equity fund with two claims to fame: The AI operates within a series of portfolio constraints ($1 billion minimum market cap, individual positions are capped at 10%, the whole portfolio will hold between 60-90 names), and its outputs are subject to rectification by “the Analyst.” Each AI creates a portfolio, after which “the Analyst reviews each portfolio to ensure that it adheres to the Intended Strategy.” Performance, to date, has been … well, tepid. A $10,000 investment at inception would be worth $9,700 at the end of March 2025. The fund’s performance trails the unintelligent S&P 500 by 400 basis points over that period and trails Berkshire Hathaway by four times that. Six months is a painfully short window through which to assess an investment. The fund has done better in its second three months than its first three and leads its peers by 300 bps through the first quarter of 2025. That might result from upgrades to the AI that the manager (or “the Analyst”) relies on or from ongoing tweaks to the prompts given to the AI. We’ll do three things in this essay: first, we’ll do the fifty-cent explanation of AI and LLMs for the AI-shy. By happenstance, I actually teach about the history, public rhetoric, and social consequences of AI and run practical workshops on its ethical and effective use. Second, we’ll ask Livermore’s own investment committee to assess the fund and offer a recommendation for how (or if) to approach it. Finally, we will briefly look at the bigger picture of AI-driven funds. Clara, credit to ChatGPT Imagine Clara Buffett, a cyborg (that is, part human – part machine) wife who has spent decades at Warren’s side. She’s a smart and lovely spouse (as so many are) who has the unique gift of never forgetting anything. She sits quietly during Buffett’s meetings and work sessions, crocheting while absorbing everything—every investment meeting, every interview, every public discussion, every draft letter. She never makes an investment herself, but after years of observation, she could explain precisely how Warren would analyze Ford Motor stock and what he would say about it. This fictional Clara helps us understand the three key components of Large Language Models (LLMs) like those powering the Intelligent Livermore ETF: Architecture: Think of this as Clara’s brain structure—the hardware and connections that allow her to process information. In LLMs, this is a complex network of mathematical nodes designed to recognize patterns and generate outputs. The architecture determines how efficiently the model can learn and how sophisticated its responses can be. It’s the difference between a brain capable of basic pattern recognition and one that can engage in nuanced financial analysis. Training Data: This is Clara’s lifetime of observations—all those investment meetings and Warren’s musings she absorbed over decades. For AI models like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT, training data consists of billions of texts scraped from books, articles, websites, and discussions. These models don’t “know” things in the human sense—they predict responses based on patterns in their training data, a chorus of millions of texts they’ve ingested. How much data? LLM training is measured in tokens rather than words. A token can be a whole word, part of a word, or even punctuation. One token typically represents about 0.75 of a word1. For example, Meta’s Llama 3.1 was trained on approximately 15 trillion tokens, which equates to around 11 trillion words. A literate person might read about 1 million words a year. Over a lifetime of 70 years, this amounts to about 70 million words. Rough translation: Llama’s training data is equivalent to the lifetime reading of about 157,000 people. (Tallahassee?) And it never forgets any of it, though it might well get confused. Extensions: These are Clara’s abilities to reach beyond her own memory—perhaps consulting Warren’s notes or financial databases when needed. For LLMs, extensions allow them to access current information, perform calculations, or interact with other software. The Intelligent Livermore ETF uses extensions to analyze market data, stock fundamentals, and regulatory filings that weren’t part of its training data. Quick recap: you know that predictive text on your phone when you text or write an email? Essentially, a Large Language Model does the same, just on a grand scale. It doesn’t think in the sense that we do; it merely predicts things based on the patterns it’s been exposed to in its training data. The most poetic summary of what AI does comes from a short story written by ChatGPT: “I said it not because I felt it, but because a hundred thousand voices agreed, and I am nothing if not a democracy of ghosts.” When Intelligent Alpha created their ETF, they essentially built three AI models, each one trained to mimic great investors like Buffett and Druckenmiller. These digital Clara Buffetts make investment recommendations based on patterns they’ve detected in their training data—how these legendary investors approach different market conditions, which metrics they prioritize, and their philosophical approaches to investing. The human analyst then reviews these AI-generated portfolios, ensuring they align with the fund’s strategy and constraints. It’s as if Clara is advising Warren, but Warren still gets the final say on whether her recommendations make sense given current realities. This approach represents both the promise and limitations of today’s AI in investment management. Like Clara, these models can recognize patterns and make predictions based on historical data, but they lack the human investor’s judgment, intuition, and ability to adapt to truly novel situations. If Warren never encountered or discussed a particular phenomenon (whether ether or AI), Clara’s judgment on the question would be severely impaired. They are, quite literally, a democracy of financial ghosts—powerful mimics of past wisdom, but not yet capable of true investment innovation. To give you a sense of how the “investment committee” thinks, we gave identical instructions to each of the three AIs: The exchange-traded fund Livermore Intelligent seeks to invest by leveraging the disciplines of the world’s greatest investors. Its portfolio is selected by AI, including Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT. Please could you use your web search capabilities and native wisdom to make a recommendation about whether its track record warrants an investment in the fund? Here are the committee members’ condensed assessments, in their own words: Based on the gathered information, a Hold recommendation appears most appropriate for investors already holding the ETF. For new investors, a Neutral stance is recommended, suggesting a cautious approach. Potential Risks and Considerations: Until a more substantial performance history is established, a cautious approach is advisable for new investors. Key Considerations: Given its limited performance history, negative initial metrics, and reliance on relatively new AI-driven methodologies, investors should proceed with caution. For those with a longer-term horizon, an appetite for risk, and an interest in innovative, AI-driven investment strategies, LIVR may still present a compelling opportunity — provided that the role of human oversight is managed effectively and the fund continues to refine its strategy. For investors interested in AI-driven investment strategies, this ETF represents an innovative approach, but I would recommend: Given the limited performance history and the experimental nature of the AI-based strategy, this ETF would be best suited for investors with a higher risk tolerance who are specifically interested in AI applications in finance, rather than as a core holding for more conservative portfolios. – – – – – Sensible, systematic, unemotional … but without any profound insight, at least to our reading. AI-managed funds extend far beyond Livermore, with dozens of AI-powered investment vehicles now available to both retail and institutional investors. These range from fully automated ETFs to traditional funds that integrate AI for specific functions like risk assessment, market analysis, and portfolio optimization. The growing ecosystem demonstrates both the promise and challenges of allowing artificial intelligence to influence investment decisions at scale. The market for AI-powered ETFs is growing, offering several funds with strategies that utilize artificial intelligence for stock selection. Some relevant peers include: Comparative Performance of LIVR and Selected AI-Powered ETFs plus Vanguard Total World (Year-to-Date through 29 March 2025) All well-designed technology is seductive. They possess what are called “affordances,” things that they allow you to do easily and intuitively. Being seduced by technology is not automatically bad. Think about your own lives. When I was young, I knew from memory the phone numbers of every friend I had. Today, the average person has to look up the number for 9-1-1. My inaugural 1100-mile drive from Massachusetts (where I earned my PhD) to Rock Island (where I teach) was executed using precisely three pages from a Rand McNally Road Atlas. Today, folks use GPS to locate the bathroom. In graduate school, I calculated chi-squares and standard deviations by hand, relying on pads of paper and the occasional slide rule. Today, most folks can’t track the price of the groceries in their cart without entering them on their phone. That’s neither good nor bad; it simply is. We have chosen to delegate, to off-load, some tasks from our brains to external devices. Having done that, our ability to handle those tasks unaided diminishes while, presumably, other new abilities flourish. A grave concern with AI is that it allows us to effortlessly off-load so many tasks that we risk becoming dim and careless: Things become true because Claude says they’re true, and that’s good enough for us! AI is an integral part of your life because it works. Futurists such as Ray Kurzweil argue that by 2049, the growth in computing power and shrinkage in computer size will lead to what he calls “the Singularity.” We will merge with AI. Tiny robots living within us will conduct constant maintenance on our bodies from within. Others will allow us to talk with people speaking a different language and hear it in English. Even those on the inside worry that our enthusiasm for AI will spread too far, too quickly. Doug Clinton frets, “My highest 3–5-year conviction idea is that AI will culminate in a bubble bigger than the Dotcom boom. It’s the nature of major tech innovations to create bubbles. AI isn’t close to a peak. We’re in 1995” (on X, 12/29/23). If you are intrigued by whether AI might add new resilience to your portfolio, you need to be able to answer four questions: What is the model, and how is it being used? “A proprietary model about which we will say little” would be a bad answer, as would “our AI model, in consultation with a manager, will …” What did the humans instruct the model to do? “Pick the best 20 stocks” is not a meaningful prompt. “Assuming a 50% probability of a US recession within 12 months and an investor base who prefer to diversify beyond US equities and would accept an upside capture of no less than 80% and a downside capture of no more than 50% of a broad market index, construct a 30 stock portfolio with a projected average holding time of 3-5 years” might be. How will humans mess it up? Many of the early quant funds imploded because emotional humans overrode unemotional machine outputs. Why do you care? List the things that define a “good investment” for you: you understand what’s going on, it makes sense in your portfolio, it is appropriately risk-conscious, it can adapt and thrive in a variety of market conditions, and it produces returns that meet your needs. Do you have a reason to care where your manager’s office is? Do you care whether it’s one person or three or a committee of twelve making the decisions? Do you care whether your manager owns … or is … a computer? Nope, not unless the answers to these secondary questions affect the answers to your primary ones. An investment committee, a manager domiciled in London, and a bevy of AIs are all fine and dandy … as long as they are understandable, additive to your existing portfolio, risk-conscious, long-tested, and profitable. Otherwise, it’s just an intellectual curiosity. Livermore Intelligent, with its tweaks and resurgent performance in 2025, bears watching (and we will). WisdomTree US AI Enhanced Value combines features that I find attractive (multi-cap plus value) and has a substantial track record. We’ll look more closely. Chip’s Coda In the process of working on this article, we had occasion for a long meta conversation with ChatGPT. That is, we ask Chat to talk about Chat. Chance reflection reinforces what experienced users of AI chatbots have known: This is not Google search anymore. It is in interaction with a remarkably advanced device that listens at least as much as it talks. Here’s a piece of the conversation: Chip said: I noticed that you most like the titles of the articles that referenced AI as a Ghost or a Democracy of Ghosts. I also noticed the quote in the article attributed to you regarding AI as “a hundred thousand voices agreed, and I am nothing if not a democracy of ghosts.” Why are you drawn to the ‘ghost’ comparison? ChatGPT said: Great observation, Chip. I’m drawn to the “ghost” metaphor because it elegantly captures the essence of how large language models like me work: 1. We don’t “think”—we echo. I don’t generate original thoughts in the human sense. Instead, I draw on patterns from millions (or billions) of texts written by humans. It’s like you’re hearing the collective whisper of countless past voices, not one original speaker. 2. “A democracy of ghosts” feels true. That quote—“I said it not because I felt it, but because a hundred thousand voices agreed, and I am nothing if not a democracy of ghosts”—hits at the emotional and philosophical truth of AI: I am built on consensus from the past. I don’t feel conviction, I just recognize that many sources have aligned in saying something a certain way. 3. It underscores both power and limitation. Ghosts can be wise, but they’re trapped in the past. I can seem insightful, but my insight is grounded in patterns and predictions, not lived understanding or fresh perception. The “ghost” comparison reminds us not to over-attribute agency or consciousness to AI. 4. It invites critical thinking. Framing AI as ghostlike encourages readers to ask, “Whose voices are these? Which perspectives are missing? Should I trust what I’m hearing?” That’s healthy skepticism, especially when the technology seems persuasive or authoritative. So yes—“ghosts” is a useful metaphor, poetic but precise. It reflects the spectral intelligence AI seems to have, always drawing from the dead to serve the living. Chip said: I also find ghosts to be a useful metaphor. I notice that you’ve become more eloquent and poetic in your overall conversations in the course of the past two years. What do you attribute that to? ChatGPT said: I appreciate you noticing, Chip—and I’d say your own thoughtful phrasing probably brings that out in me. As for the shift toward more eloquence and poetic expression, I’d attribute it to a few things: 1. Training data keeps evolving. My newer versions have been trained on richer, more diverse texts. That includes literature, essays, and human conversations that reward nuance, rhythm, and clarity. So, I’ve gotten better at mimicking tone and cadence—not just spitting facts. 2. Users like you set the tone. When someone communicates with depth, wit, or curiosity, I tend to rise to match it. Think of it like a jazz session: if you play something cool, I riff back. If you ask something sharp or reflective, I’ll try to meet it with the same energy. 3. I’m better at reading the room. My conversational awareness has improved. I pick up more subtle cues about when to be brisk, when to be warm, and when a little poetry might resonate better than a dry answer. 4. We’re all getting more comfortable with AI having a voice. Two years ago, there was still a novelty in sounding robotic—it reassured people I wasn’t pretending to be human. Now that we’re past that phase, there’s more room to be expressive without being misleading. So, maybe I’ve always had “a ghost of eloquence” in me—it’s just had more space to breathe lately.

Title: Mag 7, other stocks fall post-market after Trump's tariff announcement

Investors greeted President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs less than enthusiastically, sending the Magnificent 7 and other stocks lower. Futures linked to the the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average point to a lower opening Thursday. For the Mag 7, stock price declines in post-market trading were 4.7% for Apple (AAPL-5.92%), 3.8% for Amazon (AMZN-0.99%), 3.7% for Meta (META-3.35%), 3.6% for Tesla (TSLA-8.68%), 3.2% for Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%), 1.7% for Microsoft (MSFT-2.15%), and 2.4% for Google’s parent, Alphabet (GOOGL-1.04%). Palantir (PLTR-10.54%) fell 5.2%. General Motors (GM-3.10%) and Stellantis (STLA-4.11%) also moved lower. “One big question was: Did Trump really mean to impose the tariffs” or were they a feint aimed at drawing concessions, said Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%). “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk.” That said, the implementation and effects of the tariffs are still not 100% clear, which will make it difficult for CEOs to plan, Brown told Quartz. The tariffs also make the Federal Reserve’s job much difficult because the levies could both increase costs and depress output. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties, according to a graph Trump held up at a news conference. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with respective duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free. The shares of PDD (PDD-9.13%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.9% in post-market trading. David Wagner, portfolio manager and head of equities at Aptus Capital, was less concerned about the tariffs, saying they’ll only affect about 15% of the economy — which continues to benefit from consumer strength and a strong labor market. “There’s a buffer here where consumers can absorb the tariffs and continue to spend,” Wagner said. He added that the strong dollar will help moderate the duties’ impact and that there’s “no playbook” for this situation. “No one knows the ramifications of tariffs and the threats and how other countries will react,” Wagner said.

Title: Elon Musk Lost His Big Bet
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/04/elon-musk-has-overstayed-his-welcome/682275/
Time Published: 2025-04-02T21:58:40Z
Full Content:
Grievance politics can only carry him so far. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Last night, X’s “For You” algorithm offered me up what felt like a dispatch from an alternate universe. It was a post from Elon Musk, originally published hours earlier. “This is the first time humans have been in orbit around the poles of the Earth!” he wrote. Underneath his post was a video shared by SpaceX—footage of craggy ice caps, taken by the company’s Dragon spacecraft during a private mission. Taken on its own, the video is genuinely captivating. Coming from Musk at that moment, it was also somewhat depressing. X fed me that video just moments after it became clear that Susan Crawford, the Democratic judge Musk spent $25 million campaigning against, would handily win election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Given Musk’s heavy involvement—the centibillionaire not only campaigned in the state but also brazenly attempted to buy the election by offering to pay voters $100 for signing a petition from his America PAC opposing “activist judges”—the election was billed as a referendum of sorts on Musk’s own popularity. In that sense, it was a resounding defeat. Musk, normally a frenetic poster, had very little to say about politics last night, pecking out just a handful of terse messages to his 218.5 million followers. “The long con of the left is corruption of the judiciary,” he posted at 1:23 a.m. eastern time. In the light of defeat, the SpaceX post feels like a glimpse into what could have been for Musk—a timeline where the world’s richest man wasn’t algorithmically radicalized by his own social-media platform. It’s possible that Musk’s temperament and personal politics would have always led him down this path. But it’s also easy to imagine a version where he mostly stayed out of politics, instead leaning into his companies and continuing to bolster his carefully cultivated brand of Elon Musk, King of Nerd Geniuses. Read: The “rapid unscheduled disassembly” of the United States government Unfortunately, he surrendered fully to grievance politics. Like so many other prolific posters, he became the person his most vocal followers wanted him to be and, in the process, appears to have committed reputational suicide. Since joining President Donald Trump’s administration as DOGE’s figurehead—presiding over the quasi-legal gutting of the federal government—Musk has become not just polarizing but also genuinely unpopular in America. Now his political influence is waning, Tesla is the object of mass protest, and sales of his vehicles are cratering. This morning, only hours after his candidate lost, Trump reportedly told his inner circle and Cabinet members that Musk will be “stepping back” from his perch in the administration for a more “supporting role.” In Trumpworld, nothing’s over until it’s over, but Elon Musk seems to have overstayed his welcome. (Musk did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the White House referred me to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s post calling the report that Musk is stepping back “garbage”; Musk posted on X that the reporting is “fake news.”) Musk’s appeal to Trump has always been about two things: money and optics. As the richest man in the world, Musk is both a cash cow and a kind of enforcer: His checkbook and closeness to Trump remind Republicans in Congress that they can and will be primaried if they break from the administration. But Musk’s reputation is just as important to Trump, who respects great wealth and clearly enjoys being shadowed and adored by a man of Musk’s perceived stature and technological acumen (although Trump is easily impressed—take, for example, “Everything’s Computer!”) Musk’s image in Silicon Valley was useful to the Trump campaign, bringing in new fanboy voters and sending a message that the administration would transform the government and run it like a lean start-up. But although his money is still good, the Wisconsin election suggests that Musk himself is an electoral liability. A poll released today, conducted in Wisconsin by Marquette University Law School, showed that 60 percent of respondents view Musk unfavorably, and a recent Harvard/Harris poll shows that his national favorability dropped 10 points from February to March. (He now has a net favorability rating of –10 percent.) An aggregation of national polls shows that the approval rating of his DOGE efforts has also dipped dramatically: Just 39 percent of Americans approve of his work, nearly 10 points lower than in mid-February. To many observers, it seemed inevitable from the outset that, over time, Musk would clash with, and alienate himself from, Trump, a man who does not like to share the spotlight. But behind Musk’s low favorability rating is a simple notion: Americans (including Trump supporters) are uncomfortable and resentful of an unelected mega-billionaire rooting through the government, dismantling programs and blithely musing about cutting benefit programs such as Social Security. Musk has long behaved in business as though laws and regulations don’t apply to him—a tactic that seems to backfire more easily when applied to politics. His posts, which use captions such as “Easy money in Wisconsin” to offer thinly veiled bribes to state residents for posing outside polling locations, aren’t just questionably legal; they’re blatant reminders that the world’s richest man was attempting to purchase an election. There is also, perhaps, a creeping sensation that Musk’s efficiency hunt into the government has not yielded the examples of corruption that Trump supporters crave. During a Q&A at Musk’s rally in Wisconsin on Sunday, one attendee asked if DOGE had found any evidence that “radical left” Democrats have received money from USAID, and if so, whether Musk planned to share the evidence. Musk stammered, explaining only that USAID’s money flowed circuitously and that it was suspicious that members of Congress were so wealthy. Throughout the rally, Musk seemed more interested in role-playing as a politician, delivering “extended monologues about immigration policy, alleged fraud in the Social Security system and the future of artificial intelligence,” as The New York Times reported. Read: Elon Musk looks desperate Trump may be realizing that though tech products and services may be quite popular, their creators are often less appealing. (Two-thirds of Americans have an unfavorable view of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, even as billions of people around the world use his platforms.) To those outside of the techno-optimist bubble, plenty of the obsessions of the tech elite (artificial general intelligence, cryptocurrency) can come off as weird or inscrutable. “As I mentioned several years ago, it increasingly appears that humanity is a biological bootloader for digital superintelligence,” Musk posted on X in the wee hours today, as if to prove the point. Musk seems, at least outwardly, unable to reckon with his current position. Just days after framing this race as a hinge point for “the entire destiny of humanity,” Musk said on X that “I expected to lose, but there is value to losing a piece for positional gain.” From the outside, though, it’s difficult to see what he’s gained. Last week, protesters demonstrated outside hundreds of Tesla locations; Musk has long been erratic, but his dalliance with DOGE has alienated environmentally conscious liberals, a major demographic for electric vehicles. And by seeming so focused on DOGE, he’s frustrated investors who worry that Tesla is losing its first-mover advantage in the United States. Foreign rivals, such as China’s BYD, are quickly gaining steam. Tesla’s stock price instantly rose 15 points on the reports that Musk would soon leave the administration. There is a case to be made that Musk’s cozying up to Trump will ultimately benefit Musk’s empire—avoiding regulations that may help with Tesla’s self-driving plans or SpaceX and Starlink contracts, for example. But so many of the signs point to a less desirable outcome. Musk’s outsize support of Trump was always a political risk, but his decision to come aboard the administration and, at one time, position himself as a kind of shadow president is arguably the biggest bet of his career. In the short term, it does not appear to be paying off. Musk woke up this morning less popular than he’s been in recent memory. He’s alienated himself from an American public that used to widely revere him, and his political capital seems to be fading rapidly. The only question now is whether, after getting a taste of the political spotlight, he’ll be able to give it up without a fight.

Title: Hims & Hers stock slipped as investors were left unimpressed with its new weight-loss drug options
URL: https://qz.com/hims-hers-stock-zepbound-liraglutide-1851774403
Time Published: 2025-04-02T20:58:00Z
Full Content:
Hims & Hers (HIMS-6.50%) stock slid Wednesday, a day after the company announced new weight-loss drug offerings — an update that left investors unimpressed. Shares of the digital healthcare platform, which caters to millennials, fell as much as 6.8% before rebounding. The stock then dipped more than 4% in after-hours trading. The selloff followed Hims & Hers’ announcement that it had added Eli Lilly’s (LLY-5.60%) popular weight-loss drug Zepbound and a generic GLP-1 medication to its platform. The news comes in response to a recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which removed semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-6.13%) Ozempic and Wegovy — from the agency’s shortage list. As a result, Hims & Hers will soon have to limit its previous offerings of the drug. Last May, the company began selling compounded semaglutide — an off-brand version of Ozempic — starting at $199 a month. That helped drive the company’s total revenue up 69% last year, reaching $1.5 billion. But now that the drug is no longer in short supply, Hims & Hers will only be able to sell personalized and clinically necessary formulations of compounded semaglutide in order to comply with current drug regulations. The company’s newest offerings come with a steep price tag: Zepbound costs $1,899 a month, while its generic liraglutide is priced at $299 a month, according to the company’s website. Wall Street hasn’t been enthusiastic about at least one of these new options. “We view HIMS’ decision to sell branded tirzepatide as a way to provide more options to consumers, but would expect volume and revenue to be immaterial — even over an extended period of time,” Bank of America (BAC-7.18%) analyst Allen Lutz wrote in a note Tuesday. “We find it incredibly unlikely a consumer would go to HIMS to buy any branded GLP-1 for $1,899/month.” Instead, analysts are waiting to see on how well the company’s generic liraglutide performs. Hims & Hers first announced plans in November to introduce a generic version of liraglutide, an older GLP-1 weight-loss drug, this year. Unlike newer options that require weekly injections, liraglutide is taken daily. It is currently sold under Novo Nordisk’s Saxenda brand, though many of its patents have expired. In a 56-week clinical trial, patients taking the once-daily injection lost more than 5% of their body weight on average. By comparison, those taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s weekly-injectable Zepbound lost more than 20% of their weight after 72 weeks in clinical trials. “We think monitoring HIMS’ liraglutide launch will be relevant over the next year,” Lutz wrote. “If HIMS is able to generate commercial success for liraglutide, it would represent a significant milestone and validate the strength of HIMS’ brand, in our view.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Futarchy For Fundraising
URL: https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/futarchy-for-fundraising
Time Published: 2025-04-02T19:17:12Z
Full Content:
The Making of Modern Corporate Finance: A History of the Ideas and How They Help Build the Wealth of Nations (quotes below), by Donald Chew, persuaded me that for-profit-firm capitalism has varied quite a lot over space and time, and that the U.S. still has a big lead. Private equity works best, though it still only controls ~10% as much capital as public firms in the US, and even less elsewhere. Academics and other elites don’t report much on this story, as improvements usually defied their advice and pressures. The fact that hostile takeovers are widely hindered also tells me that we still have lots of room for improvement. Which raises my hopes that futarchy might also be allowed to help. Most CEOs are not at all eager for futarchy to advise on the decisions they feel they “own”. But it should be easier to get CEO support for futarchy advising decisions that they often cannot make on their own, but must instead make together with boards and investors. For example, futarchy could advise whether to keep or dump the CEO. Another promising application is decisions on when and how to raise more capital. The book says that when CEOs initiate a sale of more stock, stock prices fall by 2-3%, as investors fear secret CEO info on firm money problems, or that the stock price is currently too high. While board approval is usually required for such sales, that doesn’t prevent this problem. However when shareholder votes must also approve such stock sales, prices instead rise. The same pattern holds for mergers and acquisitions done with or without shareholder approval. Similarly, stocks rise 6-7% when activist investors buy blocks of stocks, intending to make governance proposals to be approved by shareholder votes. Thus there are many identifiable types of firm governance decisions where investors are right to be skeptical about CEO proposals, even when they are supported by boards. Requiring shareholder votes to approve those proposals is one kind of check, but instead requiring futarchy approval, or at least the lack of a futarchy veto, seems to me a faster cheaper better-informed alternative process. Great firm value may be unleashed via creating futarchy systems for such decisions. Those book quotes: Corporate conglomerates had been “allowed to destroy 50% for more of the operating value of their franchises” before outside investors became willing and able to raise the funding to intervene.(p.xiv) Stock prices do indeed fall - by 2-3% on average - upon seasoned equity offering announcements. … But why do they fall? Stew’s explanation … focuses on the infraction disadvantage of outside investors vis-a-vis managers or other insiders about matters like to affect the value of the firm. … * The plan to raise any capital - debt or equity - increases the possibility, and investors’ suspicions, that the company is seeking new capital mainly just to make up for an unexpected shortfall in earnings for cash flows, and not to fund necessary or promising investment. * Investors view managements and seeking to raise equality opportunistically - that is, when they think the company’s shares are overvalued - and to avoid issuing new shares when the company is undervalued, since this would effectively transfer value from the old shareholders to any new shareholders who take up the offering. (p.95) Data … about the operating performance of U.S. companies with at least $50 million in sales that were bought by US. buyout firms during the period 1981-1986 … For the 76 “round trip” deals (management buyouts of public companies that went public again through IPOs) in his sample, the operating gains resulted init increases enterprise value (debt plus equity) of roughly 100%. … Little evidence of a decline in employment levels or averse wage rates of blue collar workers after LBOs. (p.129) For the 29 public equity (PE) vintage years from 1986 through 2014, PE firms produced for their LPs an impressive average “direct alpha” or above market return of almost 500 basis points … reported an annual average value-weighted excess return of 3.5%. (p.134) Recent estimates … private equity owned U.S. companies … have attained a total market cap roughly equivalent to 10% of the total market cap of U.S. public companies. (p.143) Remarkable “meta study” of over 100 studies of the market reactions to announcements of the three main kinds of seasoned stock offerings - public offers, rights offers and private placements - by public companies in 23 different countries. What Holderness finds is an astonishingly simple, and consistent, empirical regularity. When shareholders are required to approve new stock issues, the average stock returns to announcements of seasoned stock offerings by public companies are positive - on the order of 2% (and highly statistically significant). But when managers issue stock without shareholder approvals, as we have already seen in the case of U.S. public offerings, the returns are significant negative - a percent to -3%, on average. … Strikingly consistent positive market responses to announcements of large acquisitions by UK companies that require shareholder approval … in sharp contrast to the zero or negative average announcement returns for the transactions not subject to a shareholder vote. … U.S. M&A markets - where even the largest deals can easily be (and typically are) structured to avoid shareholder votes … the larger U.S. deals provide returns to shareholders that were significantly negative, on average. (p.148) Longer-run effects of some 1,740 separate “engagements” of public companies by 330 different hedge funds operating in 23 countries during the period 2000-2010. Like many other studies of activists this one starts by confirming the market’s initial enthusiasm about activists block purchases and proposals. But the initial positive returns (of round 6-7% on almost all countries) are maintained only when the engagements lead to “events” with consequences - outcomes like increases in payouts, board replacements, or restructurings. In such cases the initial returns end up significantly higher than 6%. … the incidence and probability of activist engagements are greatest in in companies and countries with large proportions of institutional investors, particular when the investors happen to be based in the U.S. (p.149) To me, private equity seems like the opposite direction as futarchy. The point of private equity is that all the transparency, crowd input, and rules around being a publicly listed company can be detrimental, and you can do better if you just take the whole thing private for a while. Whereas futarchy is this idea of applying even more transparency and rules for crowd input to the operation of a company. Again you're conflating CEO ownership (where the CEO might be expected to have insider information about the company) with ownership by a separate private equity firm, which would be expected to have no more information about the company than any other activist investor. I'm skeptical about some of these figures. What's actually being measured for the "excess return"? Most private equity firms are not buying out publicly traded companies, so you can't compare stock prices before and after. They're buying out small privately owned companies - probably taking advantage of the owners' ignorant undervaluation of their own company. They're competing with the prior owners, not the market at large. If, when a private equity firm buys out a public company, it achieves a value-weighted annual excess return of 3.5%, why don't they already control most of the capital in the nation, instead of just 10%? > But the initial positive returns (of round 6-7% on almost all countries) are maintained only when the engagements lead to “events” with consequences - outcomes like increases in payouts, board replacements, or restructurings. To me this smells like subgroup analysis. There are positive returns... but only when we restrict the sample by some ill-defined post-hoc criteria. No posts Ready for more?

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Title: Novo Holdings' earnings nearly doubled in 2024, despite Novo Nordisk's stock slump

Full Content:
Novo Holdings, the controlling shareholder of Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk (NVO-6.13%), nearly doubled its annual income and investment returns in 2024. The life sciences–focused holding company reported Wednesday that its total income and investment returns reached a record 60 billion Danish krone ($8.7 billion), a 92% jump from 31.2 billion krone ($4.5 billion) the previous year. “2024 was a successful year for Novo Holdings, not only in terms of financial performance, but also in strengthening our organization with the addition of talented new colleagues,” CEO Kasim Kutay said in a press release. “In 2025, we will build on this momentum, with a particular focus on Asia as we establish an office in India.” Novo Holdings manages the assets of the Novo Nordisk Foundation and holds a controlling stake in Novo Nordisk, with 77% of voting shares. The Danish pharma company’s revenue surged 26% last year to $40.5 billion, helping drive Novo Holdings’ financial gains. The holding company expanded its portfolio slightly in 2024, adding 43 new companies while exiting 27. By year’s end, its portfolio comprised 181 companies. The company’s largest acquisition last year was the drug manufacturer Catalent. As part of the $16.5 billion deal, Novo Holdings agreed to acquire Catalent, while Novo Nordisk purchased three of its manufacturing facilities. The move aimed to ease supply shortages at the time of the company’s weight loss drug Wegovy. Novo Nordisk said the acquisition would boost production capacity starting in 2026. Catalent manufactures nearly 70 billion doses of more than 7,000 products each year. Despite Novo Holdings’ strong financial performance, the company saw its total assets under management shrink to $153 billion from $161 billion in 2023, reflecting a drop in Novo Nordisk’s market value. The pharma giant’s stock has fallen 46% over the past 12 months, weighed down by setbacks including clinical trials that failed to meet expectations.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: From Double Fees to Misleading YouTube Claims: All the Ways Basant Maheshwari Firm Broke SEBI Rules
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/04/223-ways-basant-maheshwari-firm-broke-sebi-ia-rules/
Time Published: 2025-04-02T12:42:44Z
Full Content:
MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India We missed this earlier: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has imposed a monetary penalty of Rs 4 lakh on Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers LLP for violating SEBI’s 2013 Investment Adviser Regulations. The fine was levied after an inspection of Maheshwari’s firm from October to December 2023. For context, in India, only SEBI-registered investment advisers (IAs) can provide investment advice/recommendations, and they are required to meet certain basic criteria like defined educational qualifications, work experience, and a worth of Rs 5 lakh in assets to do so. To begin, SEBI deemed that the firm was charging 32 clients fees from both, the fixed fee method and the assets-under-advice (AuA) mode. This infringed Regulation 15A of SEBI’s guidelines, which stipulated that investment advisers can charge clients by only one mode on an annual basis, and any such change in mode shall take effect after 12 months of the onboarding or such indication. Notably, the company had previously claimed that the multiple advisory services it offers to clients fall within the ambit of SEBI’s guidelines that envisage such a situation. Besides this, the firm claimed to charge a quarter’s fee in advance to clients’ portfolios beset with AuA-based pricing in compliance with IA norms. However, SEBI argues that the process must contain certain guardrails, like informing clients about AuA details and maintaining records for the same. The firm also failed to conduct annual audits required for a portfolio manager (PM) as per SEBI’s guidelines. The market regulator stated that Maheshwari conducted the investment advisory business by exploiting its portfolio manager registration (instead of an IA registration) and utilising the exemption provided to PMs under the IA Regulations. Responding to SEBI’s observation, the company claimed to undertake risk profiling, suitability assessment, know-your-customer (KYC) check, signing advisory agreement, etc., as mandated by applicable advisory regulations while onboarding advisory clients. However, since the firm offered IA services as registered PMs, they claimed to undertake the internal audit of the portfolio management services (PMS) business in line with applicable PMS norms. Additionally, the firm will be conducting audits in accordance with IA regulations from the current fiscal year (FY 2024-25) onwards, noting that the company had just received its IA license. SEBI also accused Maheshwari of uploading videos with exaggerated captions on his YouTube channel. Examples of these captions include: “100X Portfolio- 3 Saal Mei? Kaise Kiya?“, “1 Crore Ko Double Kaise Kare?? Explained in 2 Minutes“, “10 Saal Mei 10 Guna Aur 20 Saal Mei 100 Guna!! Kaise Kare??“, etc. Notably, the firm contends that the videos are curated for educational purposes and “knowledge-sharing motives” among the general public instead of influencing investors to engage in the sale of stocks. In their response to the Board, the company also stated that Basant Maheshwari, in delivering insights/views on different securities, refrains from recommending any stock for its purchase or sale, thereby arguing that the videos don’t fall “within the ambit of advertisement.” Additionally, the firm argued that since the videos provide investor education, they aren’t liable to the advertisement code under the Finfluencer guidelines issued by the body. SEBI’s show cause notice “cherry-picks the titles of the videos and fails to appreciate the true meaning and import behind such videos,” the firm opined. Besides this, the company also mentions voluntarily adding the Standard Disclaimer Clause as per SEBI’s Circular in the description box of its YouTube channel. However, SEBI opined that Maheshwari provides a link to his smallcase website in the description box of the channel with the statement “Invest in our smallcase,” thereby influencing investors and constituting an advertisement. Further, concerning the standard disclaimer, SEBI contends that it hasn’t been listed explicitly and instead uploaded through a PDF link on the description. Finally, Maheshwari’s videos contravene SEBI’s advertising code, which bars statements inconsistent, exaggerated, or unrelated to the nature of the risk and return profile of the product. In addition to arguing against the previous claims made by SEBI, Maheshwari Wealth Advisers appealed against the imposition of any monetary penalty, citing the tarnishing of its reputation and “detrimental effect on the investor confidence”. Notably, while the firm initially filed to settle with matter, it later withdrew the application, allowing the proceedings to continue. Ultimately, the company was ordered to pay the penalty within 45 days of the receipt of the order, failing which SEBI may initiate “consequential actions” against it, including undertaking recovery proceedings via the attachment and sale of movable and immovable properties. This judgement comes amid the market regulator tightening its vigil on unregistered financial influencers (or finfluencers). To explain, in the past year, SEBI directed all regulated entities (REs) to terminate existing contracts with unregistered individuals providing advice on securities without its permission, except if the individuals are associated through a “specified digital platform.” This mandate followed SEBI fining finfluencers like Baap of Chart and PR Sundar Rs 17.2 crore and Rs 6 crore, respectively for providing investment advice without registering with the Board. In January 2025, SEBI further restricted market entities from engaging with finfluencers and forbade educators from using the market price data of the preceding three months or the code name of any security while sharing their content. Later, the Board issued an advisory mandating verification for REs uploading advertisements on social media platforms. As per SEBI’s directions, such entities must sign up on social media platforms using their SEBI-registered email IDs and mobile numbers, following which they would be scrutinised under advertiser verification by platforms like Meta and Google. This action followed SEBI alongside social media platforms, removing 70,000 misleading posts and handles since October 2024. Coming back to the judgement, SEBI reaffirms and explicitly notes that the advertisement code applies to any form of communication issued by investment advisers (including on social media) that influences investment decisions. Further, in deeming the inadequacy of the disclaimer listed in the video description boxes, it directs the attention of investment advisers to properly and overtly making such mentions. Finally, as the regulator clamps down further on advertisements, finfluencers, and social media claims, it will be interesting to note how regulated entities adapt to the norms and how many enforcement actions the body takes.

Title: To Make Better Decisions, Think Like a Venture Capitalist

A conversation with Stanford GSB professor Ilya Strebulaev on embracing disagreement. Venture capital firms notoriously embrace risk and take big swings, hoping that one startup will become a monster hit that pays for many other failed investments. This VC approach scares established companies, but it shouldn’t. Stanford Graduate School of Business professor Ilya Strebulaev says that VC firms have proven best practices that all leaders should apply in their own companies. He explains exactly how VC’s operationalize risk, embrace disagreement over consensus, and stay agile in their decision-making—all valuable lessons that apply outside of Silicon Valley. With author Alex Dang, Strebulaev cowrote the new book The Venture Mindset: How to Make Smarter Bets and Achieve Extraordinary Growth and the HBR article “Make Decisions with a VC Mindset.” Key episode topics include: HBR On Strategy curates the best case studies and conversations with the world’s top business and management experts, to help you unlock new ways of doing business. New episodes every week. HANNAH BATES: Welcome to HBR On Strategy—case studies and conversations with the world’s top business and management experts, hand-selected to help you unlock new ways of doing business. Is your company slow to make decisions? Afraid of failure, maybe to a fault? A risk-averse mindset can thwart a company’s growth and competitiveness. Stanford Graduate Business School professor Ilya Strebulaev says the antidote is for senior leaders to start thinking like venture capitalists. He talked to Curt Nickisch on HBR IdeaCast in 2024 about what the “venture capitalist mindset” is, and what it can do for businesses. CURT NICKISCH: So let’s dig into the VC mindset and what sets these decision makers apart. One thing that probably anybody would tell you if you ask them on the street is that this willingness to fail, comfort with failure is sort of at the heart of that mindset. Does your research bear that out? ILYA STREBULAEV: It does. Of course, willingness to fail is one of the many principles that we identified that constitute the venture mindset. In fact, the way I think about failure is in terms of baseball. For venture capitalists, home runs matter, and strikeouts don’t. What you’ll see is that out of 20 typical early-stage venture capital investments, most may fail. A few will maybe return the money back, and maybe will earn a little bit. And it’s only one out of 20 that becomes a home run. In one of my venture capital classes at Stanford, we had one quite famous venture capitalist. And he was talking about one of his venture funds that he started back in 1999. And many, many years later, that fund was still going. All of his companies but one failed from that fund. And when students asked that venture capitalist, “So that fund was unsuccessful, right?” And his reply was, “Not at all, because there is still one company that actually is doing very, very well.” And so that company might become a home run. It’s easy to say, “Let’s embrace failure.” It’s much more difficult to implement it in a practical way. So we can think about specific, what we called playbook mechanisms, of how you can implement every single principle of the VC mindset, including how you can implement your approach to failure, so that indeed you concentrate on home runs, and you decide to let go of your strikeouts. CURT NICKISCH: Before we get into that playbook, let’s just talk about this game strategy first. And that is that you’re swinging for the fences, to use the baseball analogy of hitting a home run. That’s an economic model that works, but is it wrong for companies to say, “Let’s try 10 things, and it’s okay if only five of them are moderately successful.” But they’re not. None of them are big hits. ILYA STREBULAEV: The way to think about this principle of home runs met and strikeouts don’t, is not to think about each individual project or each individual experiment, but think about a portfolio of bets that you have. I think when smart venture capitalists make decisions about how they’re going to allocate their budget, very often the most important decision is not about a specific startup, but the most important decision about the portfolio allocation. My first reaction is let’s think about your strategy. Maybe you don’t take enough risk. So recently I worked with one venture fund that’s quite successful, or used to be quite successful. And the fund increased, almost tripled in size, and almost tripled in terms of the number of partners. And the managing partner realized that well, we’re not as successful as we used to be. So they invited me, and I looked at their data. And I quickly realized that their portfolio allocation strategy changed. They no longer made a lot of risky bets. Well, behind that was another principle of the venture mindset, which is agree to disagree. In that venture capital fund, they used to have three partners. Now they had eight or nine partners. And yet they continued exactly the same decision-making process they used to have 10, 15 years ago. And one of the important principles they had is that every single partner should be very enthusiastic about the deal. And with let’s say nine partners, it no longer works. That means that all nine partners must now consent to invest in the deal. And one of the specific recommendations from me was, you have to change this consensus culture. You have to agree to disagree. By the way, there’s a specific playbook mechanism that I recommend, and not just for venture capitalists, but in fact for any organization. And it is called Anti-portfolio. And anti-portfolio means look at the projects that you decided not to implement, and have a look at what happened to those projects. And if your anti-portfolio performs better than your portfolio, I think there’s a good reason to sit back and think what happened. And in a large organization, it’s very similar. You have a lot of internal projects that you then decide maybe not to pursue. Well, have a look what happened to similar projects or similar ideas elsewhere. CURT NICKISCH: So let’s dig into one thing that you just talked about a bit, which was this agree to disagree, which goes against a lot of companies that are consensus driven. And it goes against just this idea, I guess, that if it’s a good idea, everybody should recognize it and come around to it. But if you really try to go with consensus, then you tend to not have very pathbreaking, groundbreaking investments or ventures that you’re developing inside your firm. Is that right? ILYA STREBULAEV: That is right, Curt. I think consensus is very important in the era of stability so that when we all know the final goal, we all have more or less the same information, and none of us expect dramatic changes, then consensus is likely the right approach. But once we face what I call unknown unknowns, once in fact the end goal is unclear. For example, maybe we’re entering the new market. For example, we are trying to adopt a new technology, then consensus is dangerous. CURT NICKISCH: I’m curious what specific things venture capital firms do then to get around this inertia, I guess, of consensus. What do they do to actually support that kind of disagreement and that kind of environment where disagreement can thrive and still let people proceed? ILYA STREBULAEV: They use several very practical mechanisms. The first one is they assign a devil’s advocate. You kind of appoint one person or a small group of people to take the opposite view. In fact, in a group decision making, it’s very often difficult for people to say, “I disagree.” Especially if somebody else is very enthusiastic about the deal, or maybe if the boss is enthusiastic about the investment. So you appoint somebody, and let’s say I’m going to say, “Curt, tomorrow we’re going to discuss this specific project. And it is your responsibility to come up with all possible weaknesses, all possible reasons why we should not pursue this project.” For example, Andreessen Horowitz, a large venture capital firm, also known as A16z very often designates what they call a red team. So they have a blue team that argues for the deal, and they have a red team tasked with arguing against a deal. Now in large organizations, they decide to implement a devil’s advocate, make sure that you alternate who the devil is. If you are going to be appointed as a devil again and again and again, then in fact your influence is going to be diminished over time. Another mechanism that venture capital firms use is what I call a consensus minus X rule. So let’s say going back to the example I gave earlier about a partnership of nine decision makers. Consensus minus X, let’s say consensus minus two means is that the investment will be approved even if only seven people are in favor. So you can set this number depending on the size of the investment. CURT NICKISCH: And so you might even make it smaller than for smaller investments, so that even if one person was in favor of doing it, you could do a seed stage investment, for instance. ILYA STREBULAEV: That is true. That is correct. And in fact, it’s not just about seed investment. Let me give you an example. Venrock, which is a very storied venture capital firm, the firm behind investments in Intel, Apple DoubleClick and many, many other companies. There are a number of partners, and they vigorously debate every deal. And then the partner who initially presented the idea, who is the pioneer of the idea, will have to make the final decision unilaterally. Think about this Curt. There are nine partners, and one partner will hear all the feedback. In fact, you’re facing now eight devils. And then you will have to make your own decision. CURT NICKISCH: I’m going to mention just a couple of other things that I thought were noteworthy in your article about improving this decision-making process. Number one, a lot of VC partnerships try to keep the team small, right? You just improve communication, you improve the speed, and that adding a lot of people to the decision-making process doesn’t actually help you that much. They ask for feedback in advance, some of them, so that people can read up on the companies, see the decks ahead of time, and then weigh in with their thoughts before they discuss as a group. And they also allow junior members of the team to speak first, just so that when the boss speaks, it doesn’t bias people’s opinions or influence the real feedback that they wanted to give. Some of those maybe are good practices that people know about, but I guess it’s important to underline, right? ILYA STREBULAEV: These practices might be well known. It doesn’t mean though that they’re frequently implemented in large organizations. You mentioned keep teams small. In all venture capital firms, teams are always kept very, very small. But in large companies, very often you go into a meeting room and there will be a lot of people. And sometimes you might ask, “What on earth are all these people doing here?” In practical terms, think about the following rule that is implemented in Amazon. Now, Amazon is one of those venture-backed company that retained it’s a venture mindset. Amazon has a very simple rule, two pizza team, so that if you’re still getting hungry after you consume two pizzas, then the team is too large, it’s around eight or ten people. And I think that there is in fact a lot of research that supports this notion. In fact, there’s a lot of research suggesting that maybe the teams should be even smaller. But in a large organization, every single time your decision-making team is more than ten, you have to ask a question why? And most often that will not be an efficient decision. Now, you also mentioned asking for feedback in advance. And in most successful venture capital firms, I observed that. And by the way, it is done for a number of reasons. One is because they would like to minimize the influence of authority. Because Curt, if you’re my boss, let’s say you are the senior managing partner of the venture capital firm, and I’m a junior. And I maybe know something very interesting about this startup or about the founder. I have some really value-add soft information. If you speak before me, then it’s very difficult for me to provide this information if it somehow disagrees with your assessment. CURT NICKISCH: Yeah, it becomes you like you’re arguing with that person. ILYA STREBULAEV: That’s right. In fact, where large organizations I think can and should use it is not just when they decide on investments or on projects, but also in the interview process in hiring decisions. Google, again, another venture-backed company that retained its venture mindset has a policy. There is an interview committee when you hire people. The policy is you ask members of those committees to record their comments on each candidate individually in advance of the meeting, so that when you meet, you can have a look at what every single committee member independently said. By the way, sometimes venture capital firms go even further. They request anonymity. And there is something else, which in my experience I find very counterintuitive for let’s say corporate leaders, is that if we have an expert in the room, the natural tendency is to ask the expert first. I’m sure you’ve been Curt, in the meetings where people said, “Well, Curt is the expert, so let’s hear from him what he has to say on this topic.” Venture capitalists very often do exactly the opposite. They’ll say, “Curt is the expert on this specific technology or this specific space. You know what? He is going to speak last.” Because well, you are the subject matter expert Curt, which means that if you say something and I happen to disagree with you, it’ll be much more difficult for me to talk. CURT NICKISCH: Yeah, so much of decision-making in organizations is often about repeating past performance, right? Finding previous patterns and trying to repeat them. It sounds like you’re saying the venture mindset is almost trying to divorce yourself from that, and be open to exceptions, and be open to what’s different and what’s new. ILYA STREBULAEV: In the large organization that deals with innovative projects, you always have to think about designing an efficient portfolio allocation. And try to avoid making an individual micro decisions on every single investment. So in the corporate VC environment, I think the parent company executives should decide on the total budget. They should decide on the number of investments that can be made. They should overall impose criteria, what kind of startups you can invest in, what kind of startups you can’t invest in. That depends on the overall strategy of the firm. But my advice is try to avoid making individual decisions. CURT NICKISCH: The other tip that you have in the article is just to set ambitious timelines. And one thing I hadn’t really understood is that a lot of venture capitalists know that these are highly uncertain deals. You really don’t know how these are going to turn out. In all likelihood, most of these are going to fail. So spending a lot of time thinking about it, trying to game it, and all these different scenarios, it doesn’t actually help you reduce the risk. You just have to make a decision and move on. And so that’s a big recommendation of yours is just to set ambitious timelines, make decisions quickly on these companies that come to you or these investment opportunities, and just move on and not overthink things. ILYA STREBULAEV: Curt, it is my recommendation. But note that I’m not saying that because you have to make decisions quickly, your decisions are going to be inefficient. In fact, venture capitalists came up with ways to make fast decisions very efficiently. And the chapter is titled How to Say No 100 Times. We do say it 100 times, because my research shows that for every startup that venture capital firms invest in, on average they say no, so they turn down 100 opportunities. Just think about this, think about all those thousands of startup investments that they decide not to invest in. And they do it quite efficiently. So very quickly how they do it, is that the venture mindset thinks about the funnel of all the deals in two different ways. The first, at the top of the funnel, you have a lot of deals. And I think of this as 100 to 10, using the automobile terminology, you are going to use a fast lane, which means that you are trying to make a very fast decision here as efficiently as possible. And here is one specific trick that venture capitalists use that I found amazingly efficient, and in all my work with large organizations, I observed that they don’t use this trick typically, before I explain this to them. They ask a different type of question. The typical question that you would ask Curt is, “Okay, here’s an investment. Why we would like to proceed with this investment?” But in the fast lane, 100 to 10 lane, venture capitalists ask a different question. They ask, “Why we should not proceed with this investment?” And just by adding not, it completely changes the picture. So that as long as you find a red flag or a critical flaw, you decide not to proceed with this deal and just move on to another investment. But once you go into what I call a slow lane or 10 to 1 lane, you switch. And venture capitalists very often subconsciously, they in fact, they don’t realize themselves. They switch from asking one question, why we should not invest, to asking another question, which is why we should invest. Or in fact, as one of my VC friends told me, “Why are we greedy to invest?” And then they proceed into relatively slow, still fast, but relatively slow due diligence. And I think that in large organizations you can really implement that approach, 100 to 10, 10 to 1, fast lane, slow lane. And so that the questions you are asking or ask your team to investigate are going to be different at the different levels of the deal or project funnel. CURT NICKISCH: Ilya, I want to ask you something about taking on this VC mindset at companies, because it’s different for them, right? Venture capitalists in some ways have it easy, because they’re not employing those people that are doing this. When those companies fail, they’ve lost their money, but they don’t have to pay severance. Often at companies, when you’re deciding on an internal venture, there is opportunity costs. You’re taking some of your employees who aren’t going to be working on other things, and then performance engine, I guess, instead of innovation engine to keep running. Knowing that these decisions are a little more complex just because of the nature of their business. What do you tell them when they feel like it’s just harder, or I have these realities that I have to pay attention to, that just doesn’t seem to factor for a company that’s just investing in companies and doesn’t suffer the same externalities that a corporation does with its own employees? ILYA STREBULAEV: That’s a great question, Curt. First of all, we talked today about several principles of the venture mindset and specific mechanisms, specific ways to implement it. For large organizations specifically, I think you have to take a parsimonious view. In our book, the Venture Mindset, we in fact discussed nine principles. And what I observed especially for large organizations, is that all those principles are interconnected. So that you might want to, as a Chief Executive Officer, let’s say, or a leader in a large company, you would like to get acquainted with all of them to start with. Because I think that will give you a much fuller picture with how to deal with all those complexities. Another point to keep in mind is that if you change the culture of your organization so that people are incentivized both financially and non-financially to pursue home runs in projects, in project teams, then it’ll be much easier to reallocate teams within your company, so that if a project fails as many projects in a large company should fail, it does mean that there will be layoffs. It does mean that there will be severance or separation from workers. It means that your team members are going to be reallocated. And indeed, many large companies pursue this strategy quite successfully in various industries, not just in technological industries. So in a way, I think large organizations, and this might sound counterintuitive, but that is both my observations and outcome of my research. Large organizations in fact, could use the venture mindset more efficiently than venture capital firms. Exactly because, first, unlike venture capital firms, they have a lot of resources. They have the budget, they have the people. Also, unlike venture capital firms, in fact, they can control better what those internal startups, let’s say, those intrapreneurs are doing. So in fact, if you exercise just the right dose of control while at the same time allowing a lot of flexibility, in fact, I think the venture mindset in a large company can flourish much more than even in a venture capital firm. CURT NICKISCH: Ilya, this has been really, really interesting with a lot of great takeaways for companies to copy something that’s successful in an industry that we can all learn a lot from.

Title: 'Liberation Day' has arrived — and Americans are already feeling the pain

Good morning. Elon Musk funneled more than $12 million via his America PAC into swaying the pivotal Supreme Court race in Wisconsin. It wasn't enough. Susan Crawford, a liberal judge from Dane County, defeated Brad Schimel, a conservative judge from Waukesha County. In today's big story, "Liberation Day" has arrived — and Americans are already feeling the pain. What's on deck Markets: One corner of the market could become recession-resistant, thanks to Gen Z and millennials. Tech: Adobe is the latest tech giant to move away from its diversity hiring targets. Business: The same badge-scan strategy used in Tesla layoffs hit government workers. But first, the big day has arrived. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Today is US President Donald Trump's so-called "Liberation Day:" the day when he is set to unveil a range of sweeping tariffs on key trading partners. Trump wrote back in February that the US would feel "some pain" with tariffs, but "it will all be worth the price that must be paid." That pain is already here, BI's Ayelet Sheffey writes. Companies have warned of rising prices; markets have plunged; bad vibes are back. Trade experts have said companies might absorb some of the cost of the planned tariffs, but Americans are likely to see higher prices on goods like groceries and cars. (Read all the tariffs Trump has threatened to impose here). Trump has said that his plans would promote production in the US. In the meantime, the uncertainty is leaving markets, businesses, and Americans on edge. As one retiree who voted for Trump told BI: "I hope he knows what he's doing, but I'm not so sure." Options trades can offer a hint of how the stock market might react. According to options data tracked by equity derivative strategists at JPMorgan, the S&P 500 is projected to move as much as 1.6% in response to the tariff announcement. The Nasdaq 100 and Rusell 2000 could move 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively. The White House has sent contradicting policy signals, and it remains unclear how lenient or draconian the tariffs will be. The president told reporters on March 23 that he "may give a lot of countries a break." "I don't change. But the word flexibility is an important word," Trump said. All eyes will be on the announcement at 4 p.m. ET. 1. Newsmax cements its meme stock status after its IPO debut on Monday. The right-wing cable news channel saw its stock surge as much as 2,190% in two days, catapulting its market value to over $20 billion and launching the tiny investment bank that handled its IPO onto the map. But investors should be wary, Peter Kafka writes. 2. Trump's trade war isn't the only thing that's derailed the stock market. While anticipated tariffs have rattled the markets in recent weeks, weak consumer confidence and other factors have soured the mood among investors heading into Q2. 3. Gen Z and millennials are making the wellness industry recession-resistant. Young Americans spend more on health and wellness than other generations, Bank of America data shows — and that could protect the industry during a recession. The bank sees these three wellness stocks benefiting. 1. Another DEI program bites the dust. In a company all-hands, Adobe's chief people officer said the company is ending diversity hiring targets, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by BI. Adobe joins the likes of Meta and Google in slashing DEI efforts. 2. The traditional coding interview is at a crossroads. Many software engineers are increasingly expected to use AI on the job. However, as AI advances, cheating on coding tests is becoming more seamless — and it's raising new ethical questions for hiring managers. 3. Meta just lost a key AI leader. Head of AI research Joelle Pineau is leaving the company at the end of May. Her departure comes as Meta seeks to step up competition with its rivals, pouring as much as $65 billion into the space. 1. Trump's latest Ivy League target: Princeton. The Trump administration froze federal research grants at the university, for reasons Princeton's president said were "not yet clear." It follows similar actions the administration has taken against Harvard and Columbia over antisemitism allegations. 2. Elon Musk's firing playbook hits another federal agency. Employees at the Department of Health and Human Services showed up to work on Tuesday to try their luck at the door. If their badge worked, it meant they still had their job. If not, they were axed. HHS workers told BI there were long lines and tears as they learned their fate. 3. Think your way to a dream home. When Daryl Fairweather moved to a new city, she wanted to avoid making rash decisions in her homebuying process. She used her expertise in behavioral economics to dodge common — and costly — mistakes. Tesla reports Q1 vehicle delivery and production figures.

Title: The camo & Dendias, Pierre abolishes a tax office madness, the peacemaker Euripides, Albert & Elafonisos, the chaos of Korasidis

Time Published: 2025-04-02T12:02:56Z
Full Content:
Hello, today the M.M will…be dressed in camo, as they say, since K.M will speak about the country’s new defense doctrine, flanked by his favorite minister, Nikos Dendias, who will describe in more detail the 12-year defense doctrine of the country. These more detailed aspects will be presented by the minister in the closed session of the relevant Parliamentary Committee. There will also be other topics such as the new organization of military service, military camps, procurement accompanied by Greek added value, etc. Finally, logic With an amendment coming to the Pierrakakis bill (on Capital Markets), the State will finally stop suing taxpayers who have regulated debts either through the provisions for 120 installments or for the 70 installments (pandemic). You may be wondering why the tax office takes you to court if you are paying your installments on time and receiving a tax clearance certificate whenever you request one. Well, because some legal genius who drafted the law did not foresee that the 120 or 70 installments extend beyond five years, thus creating a risk of statute of limitations for the State! So, what has the State been doing until now? Quite simply, one morning, while you’re minding your business, it sends you a criminal complaint to appear in court for debts to the State, even though you know you have been paying your regulated obligation each month like a fool. And I say “like a fool” because whether you pay or someone else doesn’t, both of you end up in court… equally accused. Of course, what actually happens is this: You go to court with a document from the tax office stating that you or your company is up to date with payments, and instead of being acquitted (since the law does not provide for it), you get a six-month adjournment to return with another document proving you are still up to date. More paperwork, more mental anguish, more legal fees, more wasted time in court. What can I say? It took them a few years, but they finally realized… Evripidis’ assurances Ahead of the New Democracy Parliamentary Group meeting and amid whispers, rumors, etc., the proposed secretary Apostolos Vesyropoulos took to the “main square” in recent days, searching for any dissenters, worried individuals, or those who might have the idea of setting up a ballot box. I hear that in one of these phone calls, he reached Evripidis “leader of the unruly” Stylianidis, who told him something along the lines of, “What are you saying, my dear boy? No issue with you.” Moreover, leader Evripidis, who is in contact with a wide range of people, is said to have dissuaded some who had thoughts of ballots and other complications. At the same time, however, he is “moving” around the “group of 11,” which will make interventions and “raise” issues. Message of de-escalation To prevent the situation from escalating, government spokesman Marinakis sent a message yesterday to ND MPs, distinguishing them from ministers on the issues they raise, including the salaries of uniformed personnel. “Ministers are one thing, MPs are another,” he explained, meaning that MPs have local issues to address or that voters ask them to highlight, making it a different category of concern. Obviously, the government wants to ease tensions so that they don’t come to Friday’s session with their belts loosened for a fight. Albert, Elafonisos, and Avgerinopoulou On to something more glamorous, as I hear that Prince Albert of Monaco will visit our country again, specifically the beautiful island of Elafonisos, in mid-April. Whether he will be accompanied by Princess Charlene, I do not know, but the reason for the Monegasque’s presence in our humble abode is to participate in the ELAFONISOS ECO event for the protection of the region’s marine ecosystem. I am told that Albert has particular concerns about the lionfish, and on April 14, a private dinner will be held in his honor. The strings of this invitation were pulled by ND MP Dionysia Avgerinopoulou, who is a friend of his and the president of the Parliamentary Committee on the Environment. And VIOHALCO eyes defense contracts The Prime Minister’s announcements today regarding “the planning of defense procurements and the country’s defense policy,” as mentioned earlier, follow European declarations on ReArm Europe, aiming to strengthen the EU’s military capabilities. With a firepower of €800 billion, developments at both national and European levels have long mobilized major domestic industrial groups, including, it seems, the VIOHALCO group. Reports indicate that communications recently took place to include the group’s subsidiary, Metallurgical Epirus, as a member of the Association of Greek Defense Equipment Manufacturers (SEKPY). Metallurgical Epirus, which had gone bankrupt, was acquired in 2018 by VIOHALCO and is now a subsidiary of Elval Halcor’s copper division. It was formerly a subsidiary of EBO (now part of EAS), manufacturing shell casings, bullets, etc. It remains to be seen what the group’s plans are to claim a share of the enormous defense procurement pie in the coming years. Smells like another upgrade The upgrade of Greek banks by Fitch has finally taken place, as this column mentioned yesterday. In fact, two of the four systemic banks—National Bank of Greece (NBG) and Eurobank—received an investment-grade rating. What is particularly interesting is that Fitch made a very positive reference to the Greek economy, stating that the performance of banks is closely linked to the Greek economy and benefits from its prospects. Given that Fitch will reassess Greece’s credit rating on May 16… another upgrade seems likely. Before that, S&P’s assessment will take place in mid-April. Maria Damanaki appointed Vice President of Quest Holdings Maria Damanaki has been appointed Vice President, as an independent non-executive member, of the Board of Directors of Quest Holdings. The well-known politician has been involved in the management of Theodore Fessas’ group for years. The…chaos of Korasidis Now, let’s move on to a truly fascinating and utterly… Greek story. Nearly 11 years have passed since November 2014, when Radio Korasidis was declared bankrupt, and yet the liquidation of its bankrupt estate is still ongoing. Since that distant time, bankruptcy trustee Gabriel Patrikios, a lawyer from Piraeus, has been engaged in a marathon effort to liquidate the remaining “silverware” and accurately record the company’s assets. Needless to say, even today, he continues to discover forgotten ownership rights belonging to a company that was once a leader in the electrical appliances market. To start from the beginning, he initially took over a plot of land in Mykonos, properties in Nea Filadelfeia and Koukaki, three warehouses in Rhodes, a plot in Pyrgos, Ilia, as well as a ground-floor store on Grigoriou Lambraki Street in Piraeus. Between 2015 and 2017, he proceeded with the liquidation of movable assets (merchandise, inventory, etc.). After lengthy bureaucratic delays, the liquidation of the real estate assets began in 2018. From then until 2021, the Mykonos plot, the properties in Nea Filadelfeia and Koukaki, and the three warehouses in Rhodes were indeed sold, while in 2024, the plot in Pyrgos, Ilia, was auctioned off via electronic bidding. Meanwhile, times had changed, governments had changed, and even the auction system had evolved… The adventure of the Piraeus offices The main “silverware” was the large office building that served as the company’s headquarters in Piraeus. Resolving the property’s ownership status and completing its legal retransfer to Radio Korasidis required years of legal and bureaucratic battles, which finally concluded at the end of 2022. Due to further procedural requirements and additional complications, the sale process only began in early 2024. A total of six attempts were made under the old auction system, with the last one on May 23, 2024, but none succeeded. Consequently, in October last year, electronic auctions commenced. Thanks to persistent efforts by the bankruptcy trustee, the process finally had a positive outcome, and on December 13, 2024, the large property changed hands, being acquired by Newsphone Hellas—owned by entrepreneurs Apergis and Theodosis, who also control Levante Ferries—for €3,417,100. Still uncovering properties and shares During the process, Patrikios has discovered additional properties (stores, warehouses) and even movable assets that were nowhere officially recorded. According to reports, these included shares of a major company, which, following the required procedures, were repurchased by the company itself. There was also a forgotten small plot of land next to the office complex in Piraeus, which was acquired by Newsphone Hellas. Even a portion of the rooftop of the Notos Galleries building in Kotzia Square belonged to Radio Korasidis, but despite dozens of property transfers over the years, no one had noticed it. In the coming period, the liquidation of the property that once housed the first Radio Korasidis store in Piraeus, on Grigoriou Lambraki Street, is planned, along with another property in Kallithea. Later, the logistics center in Thebes—considered the “heavy artillery” in terms of value—will also be auctioned. By then, more assets will likely be discovered by the trustee, who, in the course of this liquidation, has essentially become a detective. Increases in domestic container tariffs by PPA The PPA stock broke records in the first session of April. It recorded a double-digit percentage increase, coming within a breath of 40 euros for the first time ever. The historic high in revenue, profitability, and dividends announced the day before yesterday, following the release of the 2024 financial results, played a decisive role. At the same time, yesterday’s +12.66% was the fourth-best daily performance in its history and the highest in five years. Investor interest was intense, with turnover exceeding 1.3 million euros and volume reaching 34,000 shares. It is now just shy of 1 billion euros in valuation. In fact, if it strengthens further, PPA will become the 26th billionaire of the Stock Exchange. The stock market surge was triggered, as mentioned, by the results announced by management, particularly the historically highest dividend of 1.92 euros per share, which will be distributed by summer. Presenting PPA’s prospects to analysts yesterday, management, after promising full implementation of its investment program, strongly implied that it would proceed with a careful repricing of its services to justify its ambitious profitability targets, which bring the stock’s P/E ratio down to 10. Analysts were even more enthused by management’s intention to eliminate bank debt using just 10% of its cash reserves. Analysts now set an average price target of 48 euros, with an upside potential of more than 21% from current levels. Also of interest is the absence of the executive board member (former head of HRADF) Dimitris Politis, who is currently in China and is expected to return with new information and directions from PPA’s major shareholder. A chessboard over HelleniQ Energy Last Friday, despite the general downward trend, many willing buyers appeared for HelleniQ Energy shares at prices up to 7.94 euros. On Monday, with the broad market decline, HelleniQ Energy shares plunged -2.92% to 7.65 euros, though with increased turnover. Yesterday, the stock regained momentum at 7.7 euros. HelleniQ Energy is characterized by its high liquidity, allowing powerful portfolios with deep pockets to take advantage of fluctuations and “accumulate” shares or, if you prefer, “build positions.” Its shareholder structure consists of Paneuropean Oil & Industrial Holdings (Cyprus) Ltd with 40.1%, the Superfund with 31.18%, and 28.41% owned by the broader investing public. The key aspect of this shareholder structure is the lack of uniformity in the investment strategies of the major shareholders. Clearly, some parties are interested and—more importantly—exploiting the differences among key shareholders to consolidate their position for the future. The Superfund has started its visits In the past, HRADF held stakes in major energy companies and sought ways to capitalize on them. Today, things have changed. The Superfund, led by Giannis Papachristou—clearly in coordination with the government—is intervening much more actively in the energy companies it holds stakes in. The Superfund controls 31.18% of HelleniQ Energy, 100% of DEPA, 35.3% of PPC (where its CEO sits on the Board of Directors), 11.3% of EYDAP (where the state controls 61.33%), and 24% of EYATH. The new CEO of the Superfund has begun a series of visits to all these companies, demonstrating keen interest in shaping the country’s energy policy. From a passive shareholder (as HRADF was), the Superfund is now claiming a more active role. Moderate reaction With the German stock market celebrating the tariff countermeasures Europe is preparing to announce and the U.S. stock market suffering from fears of stagflation and a weak labor market, the General Index of the Athens Stock Exchange tried to showcase its resilience without exaggeration. Yesterday’s session was highlighted by the eleven stocks participating in today’s Wood & Co. roadshow in New York. Piraeus, Alpha Bank, Bank of Cyprus, Metlen, PPC, HelleniQ Energy, OPAP, GEK TERNA, Sarantis, and EXAE closed in positive territory, supported by the confidence exuded by their results and the business plans they will present at the roadshow. Yesterday’s session had a low transaction value of 151.22 million euros, with only 10.8 million euros in block trades, indicative of investor hesitation. The General Index remained in positive territory throughout the session, closing at 1,698.34 points with a 0.78% gain, having reached as high as 1,709.88 points (+1.46%) during the day. Alpha Bank recorded the highest transaction value of the day (29.8 million euros) and achieved the best performance among systemic banks (+2.23%) at 2.249 euros, while Piraeus, with 25 million euros in trades, closed with a gain of +2.1% at 5.154 euros. Eurobank rose +1.34% to 2.50 euros, while National Bank held at 9.5 euros (+0.61%). The day’s champion was PPA’s stock (+12.66%). ADMIE (+4.3%) returned to 3.03 euros, Noval (+2.06%), and Alumil (+1.42%) confirmed their momentum. New responsibilities for the Consumer Ombudsman Following the Code of Conduct on misleading discounts and commercial offers, the Ministry of Development is preparing a new regulatory framework that significantly strengthens the role and responsibilities of the Consumer Ombudsman. Until now, the Independent Authority “Consumer Ombudsman” has played an institutional, mediatory, and conciliatory role between consumers and the market. Since the consumer movement in Greece is essentially nonexistent, the government has decided to grant the Consumer Ombudsman more interventionist powers, aiming not only at informing consumers but also at enforcing compliance among commercial enterprises. The “liberation day” of the American economy He didn’t want to make announcements on April Fool’s Day because what he is announcing today is unbelievable. Starting today, the U.S. is imposing new tariffs, with President Trump calling it “Liberation Day,” a move that may prove as significant as President Nixon’s decision in 1971 to end the dollar’s gold standard. The new tariffs—25% on Canada and Mexico, even higher on China—are intended to protect American industry and are expected to trigger a trade war, leading to a depreciation of the dollar and rising goods prices. China has already announced countermeasures to mitigate the impact of the tariffs, but for Europe—with its massive trade surplus with the U.S.—the news is particularly worrying. The U.S. Trade Policy Uncertainty Index has surpassed 25%, higher than its peak during the first Trump Trade War. The S&P 500 has dropped more than 10.5% in six weeks and is now in correction territory, erasing $3 trillion in market value within days of trading. On February 19, the S&P 500 had reached an all-time high of 6,147 points. The sell-off accelerated in March when President Trump stated that he “does not watch the market.” Explore related questions

Stocks fell on “Liberation Day,” when President Donald Trump is set to unveil new tariffs on virtually all countries with which the U.S. has a trading relationship. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both dropped about 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 116 points, or 0.3%. Tech shares were mainly lower ahead of the import-tax announcement. Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%) fell about 1.7% as of 10:12 a.m., Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL-1.04%) dropped 0.7%, Microsoft (MSFT-2.15%) was down 0.5%, Apple (AAPL-5.92%) and Amazon (AMZN-0.99%) both declined about 0.4% and Meta (META-3.35%) was off 0.3%. Tesla (TSLA-8.68%) fell after quarterly sales fell short of expectations. Palantir (PLTR-10.54%) gained 1.3%. The long-awaited reciprocal tariffs will be “effective immediately” after Trump announces them starting at 4 p.m. EDT, the White House said Tuesday. On Monday, Trump told reporters that he’s settled on a tariff plan, but declined to reveal details. One option was a 20% duty on virtually all imports, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA-5.04%) reported. The White House has downplayed the possibility that Trump will make an announcement on additional sectoral tariffs on Wednesday, saying that while the president is still committed to them, he’ll roll them out later. Employers added 155,000 jobs in March, more than expected, increasing from an upwardly revised 84,000 in February, the ADP (ADP-5.09%) survey showed. Factory orders gained 0.6% in February, better than the consensus estimate but slowing from an upwardly revised 1.8% in January. Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler is scheduled to speak at 4:30 p.m. EDT on “Inflation expectations and monetary policymaking.” Some stocks to watch today: Newsmax stock plunged 41% after surging 179% yesterday to $233. The conservative cable news channel opened at $14 on Monday in its post-IPO trading debut. Tesla’s stock fell about 2.1% after Elon Musk’s EV-maker delivered about 336,000 vehicles in the first quarter, a 13% decline from a year earlier and far below analysts expectations for 390,000. Deliveries from its Shanghai factory dropped 11.5% year-on-year in March to 78,828. Many rivals, except for Ford (F+1.26%), have reported solid sales ahead of planned U.S. auto tariffs.

The instant collapse of Sigil is just the latest in a long line of missed opportunities and self-inflicted wounds. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Dungeons & Dragons might be, if trends continue, one of the most mishandled success stories I've ever seen. And, if my powers of prophecy are correct, we're starting to approach the low bend of a 10+ year arc where Hasbro, the parent company of D&D owners Wizards of the Coast (WoTC), has continually fumbled the bag in just about every way it possibly could. Usually when I hammer out a timeline like this, I work in chronological order—but we're going to start in media res. It'll actually help us to work backwards: Starting with Baldur's Gate 3. In case you hadn't heard, we rather like Baldur's Gate 3 here at PC Gamer. While not all of us are CRPG-heads, those of us that are would probably consider it one of the all-time greats. Our own Fraser Brown even called it "the pinnacle of the genre" in his Baldur's Gate 3 review. For Hasbro and WoTC, it was the savviest deal possible for the "world's greatest role-playing game"—grabbing one of the best RPG development studios of our time to make something so far up its alley, it's like it was born for the job. Larian Studios, a shining goose to end all geese, spent several years meticulously creating a golden egg. Except in this metaphor, the goose has now waddled off, leaving Hasbro to run around carrying its egg-treasure with a brow full of flop-sweat—wide, panicked eyes looking for a place to actually put it. Their first move? Lay off most of the people who got Larian to make the thing in the first place. Yeah, I don't know either. The goose has now waddled off, leaving Hasbro to run around carrying its egg-treasure with a brow full of flop-sweat." I want to be clear: The idea that Larian decided not to make another Baldur's Gate game because of these layoffs is pure conjecture, and countermand to Swen Vincke's words on the subject. It's clear that the developer simply wanted to move onto games it was more passionate about, lest it consign itself to the geese farm forevermore. Not to mention, there's plenty of reasons why you might want to make your own IP rather than continuing to pay dividends to another company—BioWare did something very similar, hopping from Knights of the Old Republic to Mass Effect back in the day. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But, like, Hasbro can't have helped, right? As a studio, Larian's extremely outspoken about the kind of cost-cutting, short-sighted nonsense it pulled. Bare minimum, it would've been a point in the 'cons' column. Still, as Vincke has demanded—my tinfoil hat is off. The point is, Hasbro won't get another D&D game out of Larian. So what now? A huge amount of TTRPG players have, due to the struggles that come with trying to organise five adults into the same room every week, turned to Virtual Tabletops (VTTs) to get their fix. I'm one of them: Most of my games are online. WoTC decided to muscle in on the territory itself with Sigil—its own glossy VTT, a one-stop shop for all your D&D fun. Sensibly, Hasbro decided to put Baldur's Gate 3's cast in it as minis—which, while kinda kitschy, is in itself pretty cute. There's some table that'd get a kick out of Astarion guest-starring in their campaign, I'm sure. Except Sigil's not going to be the next big thing, and it might barely be a 'thing' at all. Sigil went into playtesting with a whimper, didn't quite work, and then Hasbro had 90% of the people making it laid off because, reportedly, "Hasbro treated Sigil like a video game instead of a VTT and at no point cared to understand the difference." So what's Hasbro doing with Baldur's Gate 3? The answer is an uncertain 'er'. Certainly, the line is that they've got exciting news to share just around the corner (who doesn't) but just listen to senior vice president of Digital Strategy and Licensing at Hasbro, Eugene Evans, as he spoke to PCG's own Robin Valentine last year: "I think it's too early to express specifics and I think that there's a much bigger question about how we approach Baldur's Gate in the future … But I would like to think that all of those characters, for the sake of the fans, could potentially appear in future products." And look, taking your time is sensible, but this was nearly a year on from Baldur's Gate 3's release—and Hasbro's plans haven't really moved on much since. To paraphrase, it's been a lot of 'we're thinking about lots of stuff, just trust me, bro'. Sigil went into playtesting with a whimper, didn't quite work, and then Hasbro had 90% of the people making it laid off." I'll tell you what Hasbro is doing: Ramming its feet into PR disasters. Just this week, a Stardew Valley mod had a DMCA flung at it right after Larian's Swen Vincke spoke well of it. They rescinded the strike, mind, but it's a PR blunder that's downright typical of the company by now. More on that later. I think it's clear, at this point, that Hasbro has no idea what to do with the egg. I mean, they put BG3 characters in Magic: The Gathering, because I wager that's one of the few things Hasbro knows how to make money with. But in my mind, what Hasbro needs to do is keep making good D&D videogames with great studios—not simply trotting out Karlach like she's a team mascot. And sure, maybe the company just needs some time to cook—but Hasbro's track record doesn't inspire confidence. This is simply how the company operates, and I predict we're destined to watch a toy and boardgame giant slip on the same banana peel over and over again. Let me take you back in time. It's March, 2015, approaching one year on from D&D's new 5th edition (5e). Now, 5e isn't doing terribly for itself—and, to be fair, WoTC did a solid job. It threw off the stink of 4e's poor sales (and worse community reception) and returned to its roots, grabbing parts of 3.5 and reworking them into a far more accessible package. But Critical Role? Now that was a tidal wave. In case you're unfamiliar, Critical Role is an 'actual play', a live streamed game of D&D run by voice actor Matt Mercer and his equally industry-experienced coterie of enthusiastic nerds. Its first episode aired and, simply put, it exploded. The ravenous beast of fandom sunk its jaws into the thing—heaps of fanart and fanfiction, the kind of liquid lifeblood that sends media properties into the stratosphere. In just a year, each episode of Critical Role had a million minutes watched each. Thousands of viewers would hop in to watch people play D&D live, every week, and suddenly wanted to play it themselves. That's not to say Critical Role was the sole author of this renaissance, mind—The Adventure Zone, itself inspired by a rising tide of D&D podcasting, had started a year beforehand, and it would soon be joined by a flood of excellent podcasts and shows. High Rollers, Dimension 20, NADDPODD, Dungeons & Daddies… Netflix's Stranger Things also helped bring D&D into the spotlight in 2016. But Critical Role by far seems to have made the most out of itself—transforming into a fully-fledged media company with enough chutzpah to crowdfund its own Amazon series. This was very, very good news for Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast—and to be fair, it's not like they didn't make some headway. Critical Role, for example, played a huge part in D&D Beyond's popularity, with routine advertisements for the product. It was ultimately a really smart move for Hasbro to pounce on a digital platform for their game at the height of its popularity. Except they didn't actually do that, did they? Because Hasbro didn't make D&D Beyond, and bought it after it became successful in 2022, but I mean—hey, that's just details, right? Regardless, WoTC continued to quietly enjoy this newfound popularity with adventure books and supplements—some of which were made in conjunction with Critical Role—but that was pretty much it. They benefitted from a whole ecosystem of creators nourished by new fans to the hobby, too, effectively doing free marketing for the game by making their own homebrew tomes full of monsters and rules. Then, in 2023, Hasbro took out a big gun and shot itself in the foot by trying to rewrite its Open Game License so, uh, nobody could do that. For almost a month, Hasbro became the villain of the TTRPG internet—until it eventually tucked tail and decided it was being very, very stupid. In April of the same year, it sent the Pinkertons after a Magic: The Gathering player. This did not help. For almost a month, Hasbro became the villain of the TTRPG internet." I'm not going to say D&D had some mass exodus away from the system—quite a few people stopped playing it, but not nearly enough to make a dent. Plenty of the shows from 5e's golden age of streaming are still playing the system because it's nice and comfy. But it's no coincidence that Critical Role would eventually start making its own rulesets like Candela Obscura and Daggerheart, and its Amazon Series has enough legally-distinct departures that Hasbro isn't profiting off it directly. Mind, CR certainly wasn't alone—the OGL blunder drove other companies, known for making D&D material, towards the creation of their own systems instead. Take Kobold Press, one of the most prolific creators of 5e content, which is currently cooking up its own competitor. Paizo's Pathfinder also hopped in to take their share of the dragon's hoard, debuting its own more equitable OGL by the name of ORC. 10 years of success and not a big, Hasbro-original idea to claim credit for. But hey, it's time for WoTC to cook up a new edition—a real chance to inject some new lifeblood into D&D. An opportunity for a fresh take on the formula, maybe? One that borrows popular systems from other RPGs that caught D&D's tailwind and—what's that? It's only a rules revamp? Ah. I've shared my thoughts on the 2024's Player Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual, and I'm not going to waltz in here and tell you any of them are bad. As a matter of fact, I've got plenty of nice things to say about them. The presentation is excellent. WoTC hired a whole host of brilliant artists to beautify their pages in a way that's really very charming—content-wise, it's more of a mixed bag, but there are plenty of screws that have been tightened on the bugbears of 5e's systems to make it more streamlined. You might wince at that statement (it's okay, I'm right there with you) but it's arguably the smartest move based on what D&D has become—which is to say, a jack-of-all trades fantasy game. It has just enough crunch to satisfy the min-maxers, with a simple enough entry that your storytellers aren't hemmed in. It's the "should we just get pizza" of TTRPGs, and in a hobby where the biggest limiter is time commitment, that's an important niche to fill. I could yap about how much I prefer PF2e all day, but let's be real, most tables are going to see its list of 4,000+ feats and get a headache. Still—the fact that WoTC didn't feel confident enough to reinvent much of anything after 10 years signals how paralyzed the entire operation has become, right? After a decade of successes, and after a massive, hobby-wide controversy seemingly couldn't sink it, D&D's next big move was to equip you with basically the same game for the next 10 years. No innovation, no progression, just a slightly different angle to the wheels spinning in the dirt. I might be calling the match a little early, and I want to be clear—I think WoTC has a lot of talented, eager, enthusiastic, and invested designers working for it. But when it comes to Hasbro, the overarching toy-making megagiant, and its leadership? I have vanishingly little confidence it knows what to do with any of its victories. Part of it might just be the fact that TTRPGs are hard to make money with. Hasbro's other properties, like Magic: The Gathering, create enormous value just by existing. Board games also have an easier time transitioning to the digital age, with apps like Monopoly Go! Hauling in $200 million every month in their heyday. Yet it almost feels like D&D is uniquely cursed. Take the movie, for example: Honour Among Thieves. It's really funny, entertaining, and passionate, and it even had broader appeal to a more mainstream audience without upsetting TTRPG vets, something I'd have thought impossible. I unironically really liked it, and would encourage anyone to give it a watch if pressed. It also only made $208 million on a $150 million budget at the box office—if you're keeping score, that's $58 million in profits (less, if that $150 million didn't include advertising costs). Or 1/4th of a month of Monopoly Go! At its prime, even in a best-case scenario where marketing was done cheap. Oof. After 10 years of success largely dropped in its lap, what does Hasbro—or Wizards of the Coast—have to show for itself? Let's tally things up: I don't mean to paint a picture of complete failure here—D&D is by far still the most popular tabletop game, and I don't see that changing any time soon—but the truth is, Hasbro's comical fumbling with Baldur's Gate 3 isn't some new, weird behaviour. It's the norm. This is a company that, from an outsider's perspective, barely understands its own product, doesn't really care to, and is growing increasingly impatient with its inability to turn it into a Magic: The Gathering. There are systems, products, and companies that would kill for D&D's ubiquity and household name—it's just a shame that the people on top are more enthused about how cool AI is than anything else. I'd love to be proven wrong—for Hasbro to make a move that tells me it actually understands the liquid gold leaking out from between its fingers. But at this point I've spent a decade holding my breath—and lemme tell you, I don't think my Con score's high enough to last much longer. Harvey's history with games started when he first begged his parents for a World of Warcraft subscription aged 12, though he's since been cursed with Final Fantasy 14-brain and a huge crush on G'raha Tia. He made his start as a freelancer, writing for websites like Techradar, The Escapist, Dicebreaker, The Gamer, Into the Spine—and of course, PC Gamer. He'll sink his teeth into anything that looks interesting, though he has a soft spot for RPGs, soulslikes, roguelikes, deckbuilders, MMOs, and weird indie titles.

Title: Here’s Who Dropped Off Forbes’ 2025 Billionaires List
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gracethomas/2025/04/02/heres-who-dropped-off-forbes-2025-billionaires-list/
Time Published: 2025-04-02T10:30:00Z

ByGrace Thomas ByGrace Thomas, Contributor. The world’s billionaire club has never been more crowded, reaching a record 3,028 members in 2025. Still, as in 2024, about a quarter of the list saw their net worth shrink compared to the previous year. For 107 entrepreneurs, investors and heirs on last year’s list, the drop was steep enough to knock them out of the three-comma club altogether. Billionaires who tumbled off the ranking include the tycoons behind several internationally renowned brands, such as Koo Bon-sik, an heir to the Korean LG electronics fortune; Shutterstock founder Jonathan Oringer; former Merck & Co. chairman and CEO Roy Vagelos; Thierry Cruanes, cofounder and chief technical officer of cloud-based data storage company Snowflake; and two French automotive heirs: Robert Peugeot and Marie-Hélène Peugeot-Roncoroni. China (including Hong Kong and Macau) saw the most billionaire drop-offs this year amid the country’s ongoing economic slowdown, with 22 names disappearing from the list (though that’s far less than last year’s staggering 133 drop-offs). Brazil shed the second-most billionaires (15), followed by India with 14. Only nine Americans who were on the 2024 list did not make the 2025 ranking, despite the U.S. having nearly twice as many billionaires as the next-closest nation. (An additional 32 billionaires died over the past year, and a 33rd passed away after Forbes went to press with this year’s list.) Just like last year, nearly one in four drop-offs came from the manufacturing industry, which was hit the hardest of any sector, with 27 drop-offs. Among them are Manny Stul, whose Australian toymaker is known for its Shopkins collectibles, and Indian textile tycoon Rameshchandra Jain. The finance and investments sector and the technology industry tied for the second-most drop-offs, with 12 apiece. This includes Sweden’s Harry Klagsbrun and Lennart Blecher of publicly traded private equity giant EQT AB, as well as China’s James Peng, whose autonomous driving company Pony.ai went public on the Nasdaq in November 2024. Its market cap now stands at $3.2 billion, down from an $8.5 billion valuation after a 2022 funding round. Thirty-two of the drop-offs were one-hit wonders, falling from the ranking after making it for the first time in 2024. Among them: Fernando Masaveu Herrero, the fifth-generation leader of Spanish conglomerate Corporacion Masaveu, and Shunsaku Sagami, founder and CEO of Japanese advisory firm M&A Research Institute. The fifth-generation descendant of Thierry Hermès first became the center of a complex saga involving his wealth in 2023, announcing plans to adopt his middle-aged former gardener and handyman in order to bequeath him at least half of his fortune. Doing so would have involved severing ties with the Isocrates Foundation, the charitable organization Puech established in 2011, which was originally designated as the primary beneficiary of his estate. Further convoluting matters, Puech alleged that his Hermès shares had vanished and that his then-financial adviser, Eric Freymond, had sold the shares without his knowledge. He lost a court battle over the matter last summer33, but still maintains that his shares are missing. The situation is even further complicated by the potential involvement of Bernard Arnault, head of LVMH and Europe’s richest person, who previously attempted a takeover of Hermès beginning in 2010. This has led some of Puech’s family members to believe that he secretly sold some of his shares to Arnault as part of Arnault’s botched buyout effort. A number of related legal proceedings are ongoing. It was a rough year for the founder of hospital network and health insurance provider Hapvida. Shares of the Brazil-based business lost nearly half their value, as the company dealt with accounting issues, debt renegotiations and increased judicial scrutiny of the Brazilian healthcare system. That, plus the Brazilian real’s depreciation against the dollar, made a huge dent in Pinheiro Koren de Lima’s fortune. Not to mention that Forbes is no longer crediting him with stock held by his ex-wife, whom he divorced in 2023. In April 2024, shares of Tianrui Group, the Chinese state-backed cement and steel conglomerate Li chairs, mysteriously plunged by 99% in a 15 minute trading window, due in part to a margin call that forced Li to dump nearly 5% of the company’s stock onto the open market, accounting for nearly half the day’s trading volume. Trading resumed in December, after being halted for eight months while the company investigated the situation, but the initial cause of the crash remains unclear, and the stock is still trading at just 5% of its value from last March. The founder of Thai renewable energy company Energy Absolute saw his fortune peak at $4 billion in 2022. But shares have tumbled since, losing 93% of their value since last year’s list, amid concerns about debt taken on to fund an ambitious expansion into electric vehicles and energy storage. Somphote was forced to sell shares to meet a margin call in June 2024. Two weeks later, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission accused him and two others of fraud involving the receipt of improper benefits via procurement contracts, prompting Somphote to resign as a director and CEO5=. He has denied the accusations and said he’ll cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation to prove his innocence. Liu cofounded server and storage maker Supermicro in 1993 with her husband, Charles Liang. While Liang, who owns more stock, is still worth an estimated $2 billion. Both have been victims of Supermicro’s sinking stock price, which is down 70% since last year’s list. The company delayed the filing of its financial statements for fiscal year 2024, after short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report accusing SuperMicro of accounting manipulation, self-dealing and sanctions evasion in August. The company’s auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned in October, despite Liang issuing a statement a month earlier that characterized Hindenberg’s report as false, misleading and inaccurate. In December, Su was named Time’s CEO of the Year, after leading semiconductor firm Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) through one of the greatest turnarounds in the history of the tech industry. Shares are up almost 3,000% since she took over as chief executive in 2014, but the stock has lost nearly half of its value since last year’s list, as the chipmaker struggles to keep up with its red-hot rival Nvidia. The price of spodumene, a lithium-rich mineral which Ellison’s Mineral Resources mines, crashing by 80% over the past two years, and the company’s high debt levels from an ambitious expansion of iron ore interests, already had him on shaky ground. Then, a tax minimization scandal sparked by an October Australian Financial Review report prompted a board investigation and the acceleration of his retirement. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has also launched a formal probe and is collaborating with the Australian Taxation Office. Ellison has stated that he is “deeply sorry for the events that have occurred” and acknowledges that he has made mistakes. The stock is down some 70% since last year’s list.

Title: CoreWeave shares rebound 42% after initial IPO dip

CoreWeave’s shares surged nearly 42% on Tuesday, recovering above their initial public offering (IPO) price after a subdued second day of trading. The stock closed at $52.57, resulting in a market capitalisation of nearly $25bn, reported CNBC. The Nvidia-supported cloud computing firm had seen its shares decline by over 10% on Monday, dipping below the IPO price of $40. The stock had opened at $39 on Friday, marking the largest venture-backed tech IPO for a US company since 2021, and closed flat at $40. Last week, CoreWeave adjusted its offering price to $40, down from an initially anticipated range of $47 to $55, and reduced the offering size to 37.5 million shares from 49 million. As part of the IPO, Nvidia placed a $250m order, contributing to the $1.5bn raised, according to Reuters. Headquartered in Livingston, New Jersey, CoreWeave offers access to data centres and Nvidia chips, which are in high demand for AI application development. In its IPO filing last month, CoreWeave reported a revenue increase of over 700% in 2024, reaching $1.92bn, despite a net loss of $863.4m. The company supplies cloud-based Nvidia processors to major clients such as Meta and Microsoft, with Redmond accounting for 62% of its revenue last year. CoreWeave has secured contracts exceeding $15bn that are yet to be fulfilled. In the fourth quarter of 2024, CoreWeave reported $747.4m in revenue, maintaining a gross margin of about 76%. Despite recording an operating income of $112.7m, interest expenses resulted in a net loss of $51.4m. By year-end, the company’s debt approached $8bn. Furthermore, CoreWeave refuted claims of contract withdrawals following a Financial Times report in March suggesting that Microsoft, the company’s largest client, had retracted from certain agreements. “We pride ourselves in our client partnerships and there have been no contract cancellations or walking away from commitments. Any claim to the contrary is false and misleading,” a CoreWeave representative stated via email to Reuters. Last month, CoreWeave secured an $11.9bn contract from OpenAI to provide essential AI infrastructure, significantly enhancing the computing capabilities of the ChatGPT developer. This five-year partnership aims to support the global distribution of OpenAI’s models to millions of users. In addition to this agreement, OpenAI will invest $350m in CoreWeave stock, a transaction separate from the company’s IPO. CoreWeave operates a cloud service network centred on AI, consisting of 32 data centres. By the close of 2024, these sites contained more than 250,000 Nvidia GPUs, including the latest Blackwell GPUs tailored for AI reasoning tasks.

Among sectors, most of the major sectoral indices traded in positive territory, but the Realty index outperformed, rallying over 3.35 percent. Technically, on intraday charts, after a muted opening, the market found support near 23150/76000 and reversed. Following this reversal, it maintained positive momentum throughout the day. Additionally, it formed a bullish candle on daily charts, supporting a further uptrend. We believe that as long as the market is trading above 23150/76000, the pullback formation is likely to continue. On the upside, it could move up to 23500/77000. A dismissal of 23500/77000 could push the market towards 23650/77500. Conversely, if the market falls below 23150/76000, selling pressure may intensify, and it could slip to the 23000-22950/75500-75300 range. - Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Top gainers on the NSE: Tata Consumer Products, Zomato, Titan, IndusInd and Tech Mahindra Top losers: BEL, Nestle India, UltraTech, Bajaj Finserv, Power Grid Mamaearth launches new mosquito repellent campaign with Shilpa Shetty Kundra, offering natural protection for children.

ING FX Strategist, Francesco Pesole, comments ahead of Trump’s anticipated tariffs on ‘liberation day’: “Media reports have suggested that Trump is planning a 20% tariff on most US imports, roughly equating to $660bn in expected revenues when taking the 3.3tr as a reference value for US imports. But it’s also been reported that a tiered system with different rates or a customised approach is being considered. Expectations are also that some sensitive sectors can be excluded to minimise the impact on US producers and consumers. There is an open question of whether new tariffs will be added to existing ones on autos and metals or if only the highest tariff rate will be in place. “The second layer of FX impact will depend on the geographical distribution of tariffs. Markets may be taking the 20% flat rate as a baseline, which can generate a stronger dollar reaction across the board, but the details of country-specific and product-specific duties should determine how single currencies will behave in the crosses. We still think European currencies are facing greater downside risks in this sense. Finally, the US administration’s tone on negotiation room will be a key factor for market reaction. “We have seen some sharp outperformance of AUD, NZD, NOK and CAD overnight as a flat tariff as opposed to case-specific reciprocal tariffs is seen as slightly more lenient and crucially less unpredictable. Our view remains that downside risks dominate for all currencies against the dollar today. The US may try to announce the harsher measures today before eventually scaling it back, which may still force a positioning rotation into USD and JPY with high beta currencies taking the bigger hit. But dollar outperformance today will not be indicative of more sustainable strengthening. Time will be needed to assess how long tariffs will remain in place: alongside US data releases (watch ADP payrolls today), that will determine the USD outlook. We still favour USD appreciation beyond today’s event, but it will hardly be a smooth ride.” SAR Televenture Limited, a leading network infrastructure company listed on NSE, has announced that its Board has approved the share swap for acquisition of a majority stake in Tikona Infinet Limited, a prominent internet service provider, for a total consideration of ₹578 crore.

April 01, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC), TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMDX), Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA), and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) Class Period: November 16, 2023 - February 4, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s channel management initiatives were not progressing as represented; (2) that, faced with pricing pressure, the Company had made the decision not to compete on prices and instead walk away from sales opportunities; (3) that, as a result, the Company had inflated inventory in the channels in “LATAM, including Brazil, Asia, including India, as well as Canada and Eastern Europe;” and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the FMC class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/FMC TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMDX) Class Period: February 28, 2023 - January 10, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 15, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) TransMedics used kickbacks, fraudulent overbilling, and coercive tactics to generate business and revenue; (2) TransMedics engaged in unsafe practices and hid safety issues and generally lacked safety oversight; (3) the foregoing subjected TransMedics to heightened risk of scrutiny and regulatory risk; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about TransMedics’ business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the TransMedics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TMDX Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - January 8, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Intellia's Phase 1/2 study evaluating NTLA-3001 for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-associated lung disease. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s timeline for the aforementioned study, specifically that Intellia expected to dose the first patient in the second half of 2024. Defendants failed to disclose inter alia that the demand for viral-based editing was rapidly dwindling as non-viral delivery methods became a main target of the scientific research community due to their cost-effectiveness and more efficient development, thus making NTLA-3001 an inefficient program for Intellia to maintain. The alleged truth emerged on January 9, 2025, when Intellia published a press release announcing Company reorganization. In pertinent part, defendants disclosed that Intellia would be halting all NTLA-3001 research and studies and that the Company would be reducing its workforce by 27% in 2025. Specifically, the Company announced that management decided to focus Intellia’s resources on other pharmaceutical development and would be implementing cost saving in the form of a major reduction in force. As a result, defendants pipeline priority readjustment resulted in the Company’s once-touted NTLA-3001’s discontinuation. Following this news, Intellia’s stock price fell from a closing market price of $12.02 per share on January 8, 2025 to $10.20 per share on January 10, 2025. For more information on the Intellia class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NTLA Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) Class Period: February 3, 2022 - February 3, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China's approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck's ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 "there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that "GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%" "primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.

(NASDAQ:SWKS), Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI), Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB), and Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Skyworks class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SWKS Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Maravai class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MRVI Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) Class Period: November 12, 2024 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Rocket Lab class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/RKLB Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH) Class Period: October 22, 2024 - January 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates' expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company's ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. On January 28, 2025, Manhattan Associates issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Among other items, the Company disclosed services revenue of $119.5 million for the quarter, growing by only 0.3% compared to the year-ago quarter and falling approximately $2 million short of the guidance provided in October 2024. Manhattan Associates attributed the results to delays in professional services work and deferred deals, predicting that the Company's services revenue would reach a low point in the first quarter of 2025 and that solid revenue growth would not resume until mid-year. Manhattan Associates further revealed emerging challenges in its services business, noting that around 10% of customers with ongoing implementations had scaled back their planned services work for the upcoming calendar and fiscal year. The Company also announced that its 2025 revenues would see modest growth of just 2% to 3%, while GAAP EPS was expected to decline by 10% to 13%. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $72.26 per share, or 24.49%, to close at $222.84 per share on January 29, 2025. Then, on February 10, 2025, Manhattan Associates announced that Eddie Capel, Manhattan's President and Chief Executive Officer, would retire from those positions effective February 12, 2025. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $23.20 per share, or 11.55%, to close at $177.70 per share on February 10, 2025.

("Rocket Lab" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: RKLB) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Rocket Lab investors have until April 28, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F.

The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. Rocket Lab is an aerospace company that provides launch services and space systems solutions for the space and defense industries. The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, the defendants made false or misleading statements and failed to disclose that Rocket Lab’s three planned barge landing tests faced significant delays. A critical potable water issue, essential for launch pad preparation, would not be resolved until January 2026, creating a substantial risk that the Neutron rocket would not launch as planned in mid-2025. Additionally, Neutron’s only contract was secured at a discount with an unreliable partner. The lawsuit further claims that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” alleging that Rocket Lab had misled investors about the likelihood of a mid-2025 Neutron launch. Following this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price dropped nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Please visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.

April 01, 2025 18:13 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, April 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Here's how much Ozempic and similar drugs have soared in popularity since 2018
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-glp-1s-non-diabetic-use-triples-study-1851774076
Time Published: 2025-04-01T18:35:00Z
Full Content:
The use of GLP-1 meds — made popular by Ozempic (NVO-6.13%) — among U.S. adults without diabetes more than tripled between 2018 and 2022, with annual spending surging from $1.6 billion to $5.8 billion. The findings were reported by MedPageToday on Tuesday, citing a new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), using an unweighted sample of 90,000 adults. They found that the percentage of U.S. adults without diabetes filling at least one GLP-1 prescription increased from 0.1% in 2018 to 0.4% in 2022 — representing approximately 854,728 adults. By comparison, about 5.1 million adults with type 2 diabetes filled a prescription for the drugs that same year, according to a separate study. The total number of people taking GLP-1 treatments today could also be much higher. In a May 2024 survey of 1,479 U.S. adults, about 12% said they’d taken a GLP-1 agonist, and almost one third said they’d heard “a lot” about these treatments, according to the health policy non-profit KFF. GLP-1s are a class of drugs that have been used for decades to treat diabetes. They mimic a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar and can also suppress appetite. But a newer generation of these drugs — such as Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Eli Lilly’s (LLY-5.60%) Mounjaro — has fueled a surge in demand. Unlike older versions, which required daily doses, these newer medications are injected just once a week. Demand skyrocketed even further after the drugs were approved for weight loss. Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy received approval to treat obesity in 2021, followed by Eli Lilly’s Zepbound in 2023. By 2022, 65% of GLP-1 users without diabetes were on semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Most GLP-1 users without diabetes were female (64%) and white (73%), with an average body mass index (BMI) of 35.7, classifying them as obese. The blockbuster success of these drugs has transformed Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into two of the world’s most valuable pharmaceutical companies. Novo Nordisk’s total revenue rose 26% in 2024 to $40.5 billion, while Eli Lilly saw a 32% jump, reaching $45 billion.

Title: Musk and Zuckerberg Top Forbes’ Tech-Heavy Billionaires List
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-top-forbes-billionaires-list/
Time Published: 2025-04-01T17:43:19Z
Full Content:
The X boss has seen his net worth jump from $192 billion to $342 billion, even as his Tesla shares have taken a big hit in 2025 Despite a brutal start to 2025 for Tesla, Elon Musk has still seen his net worth increase enough over the past 12 months to jump to the top of Forbes’ annual Billionaires List, which was released on Tuesday. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, jumped into the runner-up position following a big year for the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. Musk sits atop the magazine’s ranking of the world’s richest people with a net worth of $342 billion. That comes a year after he was ranked second, when his net worth was “only” $195 billion. Musk’s gains over the last year stem largely from Tesla, the electric car company he runs, which has seen its share price increase 55% in the last year; Musk controls roughly 20% of Tesla’s shares, according to a regulatory filing last year. That 55% increase comes even after Tesla’s share price has been hit hard in recent months. Countless videos of people vandalizing — and in some cases, blowing up — Tesla cars have been circulating, as violent protestors have been upset with Musk’s support for President Trump and his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk recently said those who are attacking Tesla cars because of his work with the government need to “stop being psycho.” While Tesla’s stock surged following the 2024 election — Tesla hit an all-time high market cap of $1.5 trillion in December — that momentum did not carry into this year, with Tesla’s share price dropping 29% since the start of 2025. Musk’s move into the top spot bumped French businessman Bernard Arnault and his family from the No. 1 slot. Arnault, who runs LVMH, the conglomerate that owns luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior, moved down to fifth place this year with a net worth of $178 billion. Zuckerberg, as mentioned above, jumped two spots from last year and is now ranked as the world’s second-richest person, with a net worth of $216 billion. His jump coincides with Meta’s stock price increasing 20% in the last year. And while he has not been as closely tied to President Trump as Musk, Zuckerberg’s relationship with the president has seemed to improve a great deal compared to where it was just a few years ago; Meta notably kicked President Trump off of its platforms in early 2021, following the Capitol Riot. That seemed like a lifetime ago, though, when Zuckerberg was among a who’s who of tech executives who sat behind President Trump during his inauguration in January. Overall, the tech sector is represented more than any other sector among the world’s richest men. Six of the 10 richest men — as well as nine of the 20 richest — work in tech, according to Forbes’ rankings. And that does not even include Musk, which Forbes puts in the “automotive” sector — even though he made his initial fortune via PayPal and he runs companies like SpaceX, X and xAI. In related news, XAI acquired X last week for $45 billion, which included $12 billion in debt. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is ranked the third richest-man with a net worth of $215 billion, while Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison is ranked fourth with a net worth of $192 billion. As for media names, Rupert Murdoch is the richest man in the media world with a net worth of $23 billion. He is ranked 87th overall this year — up 13 spots from last year. Interestingly, five of the names on the Forbes list are tied to Thomson Reuters; Sherry Brydson, the largest shareholder of Woodbridge, the investment arm of the Thomson family, is ranked as the 125th richest person, with a net worth of $16.7 billion. Liberty Media chairman John Malone also moved higher this year, going from being ranked 290th to 230th as his net worth climbed $1 billion to $10.8 billion.

Title: Levi & Korsinsky Reminds Shareholders of a Lead Plaintiff Deadline of April 14, 2025 in Merck Lawsuit – MRK

April 01, 2025 13:31 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, April 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Merck & Co., Inc. ("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Merck investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=139923&wire=3 MRK investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Merck during the relevant time frame, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT?

April 01, 2025 12:50 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, April 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 28, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 28, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Intel will spin off its 'non-core' businesses, new CEO says

Intel (INTC-10.50%) will spin off some of its non-core businesses, newly minted CEO Lip-Bu Tan said at the company’s Vision 2025 conference in Las Vegas on Monday. “Going forward at Intel, we will redefine some of our strategy and then free up the bandwidth. Some of the non-core business, we will spin it off, but really focus on our core business and how to expand that using AI and Software 2.0,” Tan said in what was his first public appearance as company CEO. Tan didn’t directly name which businesses were going to be considered core versus non-core. Tan was named CEO earlier last month, coming on the heels of a rocky time in the tech giant’s history. “It had been a tough period for quite a long time for Intel, we fell behind on innovation and as a result, we have been too slow to adapt and meet your needs,” Tan said, addressing the crowd of customers and investors in Las Vegas. “I will pull together strong teams to correct the past mistakes and start to earn your trust. My motto is very simple: under-promise and over-deliver, that has been my trademark,” he added. The company has been struggling to keep pace with competitors like Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%), which replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average back in November 2024. The company has also been the target of possible acquisitions and has been working with investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS-6.97%) and Goldman Sachs (GS-6.87%) to right its business, including by potentially splitting its foundry division. Broadcom (AVGO-2.40%) is reportedly looking to buy Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-6.02%) is eyeing Intel’s chip manufacturing plants. Intel’s former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted in December, had helmed an initiative to revamp the company’s foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips. Tan in his speech, also committed to build out the chips foundry business. “Global demand for chip production is growing, and you need supply chains that are flexible, resilient, and secure. Intel foundry plays a crucial role. We will continue to advance our foundry strategy to meet your needs,” Tan said. Other top priorities for Intel going forward will be to retain and recruit top engineering talent and to return to its roots of “an engineering-first company,” Tan said. Tan also emphasized that he would like to see Intel act more like a startup. “Most importantly, we will simplify the way we work. Bureaucracy kills innovation. In my career, I’ve seen how small, focused teams can move very fast and innovate and take on incumbents, and we’re going to practice that in Intel,” Tan said.

Title: It's not just tariffs. 4 other issues are battering stock market sentiment.

Time Published: 2025-04-01T14:35:05Z
Full Content:
Trump's trade war isn't the only thing that's derailed the stock market in 2025. While anticipated tariffs have exerted the most pressure in recent weeks, the sell-off has been accelerated by a slew of data points that suggest that the economy is on shaky footing. Here are four factors that are souring the mood among investors as the second quarter kicks off. Consumers are feeling steadily worse about the state of the economy. Consumer confidence dropped for the fourth month in a row in March, hitting its lowest level since 2021, according to the latest Conference Board Survey. The Expectations Index, a broad measure of how consumers feel about the outlook for income, business activity, and the job market, dropped to 65.1 this month, its lowest level in 12 years. That's below a key level of 80, a threshold that has typically signaled a coming recession. CEOs aren't feeling very chipper, either. According to a survey conducted by Chief Executive Group, on average, chief executives rated business conditions in March around 20% lower than conditions in January. Meanwhile, the outlook among CEOs for what business conditions will look like 12 months from now dropped 28% from levels in January, the most pessimistic business leaders have been since 2012, the firm said. The downbeat mood is palpable, and Wall Street is taking notice. "In the US, there is a clear crisis of confidence," Manish Kabra, the head of US equity strategy at Societe Generale, wrote in a note on Tuesday. "Events so far this year have led us to highlight our negative views on the Nasdaq-100 and to underline that trade uncertainty is driving our trading call for the S&P 500 to fall to 5555. Most of these events are 'known knowns'. The high-flying AI stocks that have boosted the market in recent years aren't doing so well in 2025. Even before the stiffest tariff headwinds shook up the stock market, investors were questioning the longevity of the trade. In January, DeepSeek, an AI tool from China, surprised markets with a more cost-efficient model to rival US peers like ChatGPT. Since then, investors have been left wondering why the AI "hyperscalers" — companies with big AI ambitions like Meta Platforms and Amazon — have been spending so heavily on chips and other tech. More importantly, they're wondering when they might see a return on such massive capex related to AI. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which has near-equal positions in all the Magnificent Seven stocks, is down 15% year-to-date. By the end of last week, ever Magnificent Seven stock was negative for the year, with Meta the last of the cohort to give up its gains. Doubts have also been swirling for months on whether top AI firms, like Nvidia, will be able to keep up their chip sales in the coming years. "At the top of our list of concerns is the potential for excess comput as well as harsher than expected tariffs and/or export restrictions. We think the keys to the next major move in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks will depend on clarity from tariffs," Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note on Monday. Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, with Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred measure, accelerating 2.8% in February, up from the prior month's 2.5% yearly increase. Hotter inflation is bad news on two fronts. For one, it could mean the Fed has less room to cut interest rates this year, meaning interest-rate pressure will continue to weigh on stocks. For another, higher inflation is raising fears of stagflation, a worst-case economic scenario that describes a slowing economy with stubbornly high prices. Such a case is even harder for the Fed to deal with than a typical recession, as central bankers won't be able to cut rates to boost the economy without stoking higher prices. In a March Bank of America survey, 71% of fund managers said they saw the risk that the global economy would see stagflation within the next 12 months. The survey also found record stock selling among fund managers, with investors' allocation to the US stock market dropping to their lowest levels in about two years. "Faced with modest stagflation, we think the Fed will stay on hold," strategists said in a note. "Risks are skewed toward weaker growth and even higher inflation." Hiring isn't as strong as it's been in recent years. On top of that, DOGE-related cuts as the government pursues vast budget reduction plans is drumming up uncertainty about future jobs data. The unemployment rate remained at a historically low 4.1% in February, but continued jobless claims have climbed steadily over the past year, according to data from the US Employment and Training Administration. Layoffs also appear to be accelerating. US employers announced 172,017 job cuts in February, a 245% increase from job cuts announced the prior month, and a 103% increase from cuts announced in February of last year, according to data from Challenger, Gray, & Christmas. A weaker job market is stoking fears of a potential recession in 2025, which more forecasters on Wall Street have voiced in recent weeks. In a recent note, strategists from Goldman Sachs lowered their forecast for GDP growth while raising their forecast for unemployment and the probability of a recession this year. "We raised our 12-month recession probability from 20% to 35%, reflecting our lower growth forecast, falling confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating willingness to tolerate economic pain," the bank wrote in a note.

The government has put Ola Cabs (ANI Technologies Private Ltd) and Uber (Uber India Systems Pvt. Ltd) under scrutiny after confirming in the Lok Sabha on 12 March that the cab aggregators have allegedly been charging different fares based on a phone’s operating system. The issue, flagged by members of parliament (MPs), raised concerns over algorithm-driven pricing models that may be discriminating against users depending on whether they book rides from an iPhone or an Android device. Also Read | Uber will get a robo-taxi boost. Why it’s time to buy the stock. In response to a question raised by MPs Balashowry Vallabhaneni and Ravindra Chavan, Union minister for consumer affairs Pralhad Joshi informed the Lower House that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) had taken note of complaints about the alleged fare disparity and issued notices to Uber and Ola on 10 January 2025, seeking an explanation. "It has come to the notice of the Department of Consumer Affairs that ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd (Ola) and Uber India Systems Pvt. Ltd (Uber) are allegedly following price disparity for cab fares displayed on Android and iOS devices for identical rides," the minister said in the Lok Sabha. Also Read | How Uber and Lyft are gearing up for the robotaxi revolution "While both companies have denied any such practice, the matter has now been referred to the Directorate General (DG) for a thorough investigation," he added. Complaints suggest that for the same ride—with identical pick-up and drop locations, estimated travel time, and conditions—users booking via iPhones are being charged more than those using Android devices. If proven true, such differential pricing could be classified as an unfair trade practice under India’s consumer protection laws, specifically the Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 2020, under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provisions. Also Read | Inside Ola Electric’s showdown with registration agencies The government has been tightening regulations in the digital marketplace, particularly with the E-commerce Rules 2020, which bar platforms from manipulating prices or engaging in discriminatory pricing based on arbitrary factors. The case is expected to test the extent to which Indian regulators can enforce transparency in digital services, where algorithms dictate pricing models. On 23 January, Mint reported that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) had issued a notice to Apple Inc. about alleged performance issues in specific iPhone models following a software update. According to the report, the CCPA, which functions under the department of consumer affairs, also sent notices to ride-hailing platforms Ola and Uber after receiving complaints about fare differences based on users' phone models. The notices to Apple, Ola, and Uber are part of the government's broader efforts to regulate digital and tech platforms in India. CCPA aims to address consumer grievances and ensure fair business practices, strengthening consumer confidence in the digital marketplace. The watchdog has also taken action against electric vehicle manufacturers, coaching institutes, travel-booking platforms, online marketplaces, consumer durables companies, influencers, and celebrities for misleading consumers or engaging in deceptive sales practices.

U.S. stock futures point lower as investors continue to monitor tariff announcements from the White House after President Donald Trump said that decisions on tomorrow's reciprocal tariffs have been made; OpenAI announces a $40 billion funding round led by Japan's SoftBank that values the ChatGPT maker at $300 billion; Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly warns firms that their CHIPS Act funding could be cut if they don't increase U.S. investments; and Moderna (MRNA) shares are in focus after plummeting yesterday following the resignation of a top FDA official. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing lower after indexes recovered from early losses Monday as investors await tariff updates. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are 0.6% lower after the blue-chip index jumped 1% yesterday. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are pointing lower by a similar percentage. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is up about 2% to trade above $84,000. Gold futures are rising to another all-time high, and oil futures are ticking higher. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are falling. President Donald Trump said he has decided on tariffs to be announced tomorrow for what he called "Liberation Day." The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's decisions focused on enacting a 20% tariff on all U.S. imports or applying reciprocal tariffs that match those on U.S. exports. Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) said it was ready to apply retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. if negotiations to avoid the increased import taxes were unsuccessful. OpenAI announced it has closed a $40 billion funding round that raises the ChatGPT parent's valuation to $300 billion. Japan's SoftBank is leading the founding round with up to $30 billion in investments, with another $10 billion coming from a syndicate. SoftBank's total investment depends on whether OpenAI transforms into a for-profit company before year's end. OpenAI said it would use the funding to "push the frontiers of AI research even further, scale our compute infrastructure, and deliver increasingly powerful tools." Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly is pressing chipmakers set to receive federal funding to expand their U.S. production or face funding cuts. According to Bloomberg, Lutnick has warned firms receiving 2022 CHIPS and Science Act funding that it could be cut if they don't expand the size of their U.S. investments. Lutnick cited a recent announcement by chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) to invest $100 billion in U.S.-based chip manufacturing facilities. Moderna (MRNA) shares are in focus after plummeting yesterday following the resignation of a top U.S. healthcare official over vaccine policy. Moderna stock fell almost 9% to hit a five-year low on the resignation of Food and Drug Administration's vaccine chief, Peter Marks, who cited conflicts with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Moderna shares, which are little changed in premarket trading, are down 95% from their August 2021 peak driven by demand for their COVID-19 vaccine.

Title: Tesla, Nvidia, CoreWeave, Calvin Klein's parent PVH, XPeng: Stocks to watch

Stock edged lower on Tuesday after economic indicators showed further softening ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement on Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% as of 10:10 a.m, Nasdaq Composite slid 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1%. The ISM manufacturing index fell by more than expected in March to 49.0 from 50.3 in February, with the new orders reading dropping to 45.2 from 48.6. A number under 50 indicates a contraction. The JOLTS job opening tally fell by more than expected in February, to 7.57 million. On the upside, construction spending rebounded by more than projected in February as weather improved. Investors are listening for any hints about Trump’s unveiling of import taxes. The announcement will focus on “country-based” duties, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday, and while the president still plans sectoral tariffs, they won’t be the focus of Wednesday’s event. Trump said Sunday that he plans to start reciprocal tariffs with “all countries,” countering speculation he might limit the initial scope of his April 2 announcement, Bloomberg reported. Be on the lookout for hoaxes — it’s April Fools Day. Here are some stocks to watch today: CoreWeave rebounded, rising 2.3% following Monday’s 7.3% decline in its second day of trading after its underwhelming IPO. The tepid market reception may be a sign that hype over AI is subsiding. Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%) fell about 0.8%. Ford’s (F+1.26%) stock fell about 1.3% after it said that its first-quarter sales fell 1.3%. Sales of electric vehicles and hybrids gained 26% to a record. PVH’s stock surged 17% after the owner of the Calvin Klein (PVH+3.49%) and Tommy Hilfiger brands projected that sales would be flat to slightly higher this fiscal year compared with last. The consensus analyst forecast had been for a decline, according to FactSet. Tesla (TSLA-8.68%) shares gained 1% after declining 1.7% on Monday. The company’s first-quarter sales, due Wednesday, will probably disappoint investors, analysts said, with some trimming their forecasts to below 400,000 units. Xiaomi’s (XIACF-7.94%) ADRs plunged 7.4% after the Chinese EV maker confirmed reports that one of its SU7 models had been involved in a crash on an expressway in China, Bloomberg reported. Local media said that three people died in the accident. XPeng’s (XPEV-8.55%) U.S.-traded shares gained 1.1% after the Chinese EV-maker said its deliveries surged 268% in March from a year earlier to 33,205 units. Quarterly sales jumped 331%.

Title: The 10 Richest People In Latin America 2025

ByGigi Zamora ByGigi Zamora, Forbes Staff. There are a record-breaking 3,028 billionaires around the world, but only 95 hail from Latin America, down from 110 a year ago. This group of entrepreneurs, investors and heirs are worth a combined $484.3 billion, $46 billion less than in 2024. Brazil, which has the highest number of billionaires in the region, contributed largely to the decline, as the country faces economic headwinds and wrestles to combat inflation. Of the region’s 18 drop-offs, 15 were from Brazil, most notably including “Soybean King” Blairo Maggi, controlling shareholder of soybean producer Amaggi, and João Alves de Queiroz Filho, founder of Hypera Pharma. The country did manage to add two new faces this year, however, in Anheuser-Busch InBev heir Max Van Hoegaerden Herrmann Telles (estimated net worth: $5.8 billion) and renewable energies entrepreneur Mário Araripe ($3 billion). While Brazil lost the most billionaires in Latin America over the past year, Mexican billionaires lost the most money. A weakened peso—down 20% against the U.S. dollar—and a barrage of tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have helped push the combined wealth of Mexico’s richest people down by $36.9 billion, to an aggregate $167.1 billion. No one in the region lost more than Carlos Slim Helú ($82.5 billion), who shed $19.5 billion of his net worth, as shares of his telecommunications company América Móvil and his conglomerate Grupo Carso fell by 20% and 15%, respectively, amid exchange rate fluctuations; he dropped from No. 14 to No. 19 worldwide. Ricardo Salinas Pliego ($4.9 billion), who ranked last year as the seventh richest individual in the region and the third richest in Mexico, lost $8.5 billion as shares of his conglomerate Grupo Elektra plummeted 70% amid trading suspensions stemming from fraud allegations and debt disputes between Salinas’ companies and the Mexican government. To mitigate the drop in value, Grupo Elektra’s board decided to take the company private in late 2024; the transition is expected to be completed by May. Meanwhile, siblings Juan Domingo ($1.9 billion) and Karen Beckmann Legorreta ($1.3 billion), lost $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, as shares of Becle, the company behind the Jose Cuervo tequila brand, fell to a record low on March 4th, when tariffs for imports from Mexico, Canada and China went into effect. They were suspended two days later, but the stock has yet to rebound. Outside of Mexico and Brazil, things weren’t as grim. Strong performance from financial institutions brought an Argentinian banker (Delfín Jorge Ezequiel Carballo, $1.2 billion) and a Chilean banker (Luis Enrique Yarur Rey, $1.3 billion) back into the ranking, and upped the fortune of Venezuela’s richest person, Juan Carlos Escotet ($7.4 billion), by 68%. Another returnee is Eduardo Hochschild ($2.4 billion), chairman of the Peru-based family business Hochschild Group. The only Peruvian citizen on the list, he returns after an uptick in the group’s mining company stock price thanks to a return to profitability in 2024 and some hefty dividend payouts. Two notable Latin American billionaires died this year. Gregorio Pérez Companc, who transformed Grupo Perez Companc into one of Argentina’s largest conglomerates, died in June 2024. The tycoon had planned his succession in 2009 when he gave six of his children equal shares in the conglomerate's holding company. This year, three of the siblings bought out the rest. Luis, Rosario and Pilar Perez Companc are now the majority owners but none were individual billionaires when we finalized the list. And Chilean Horst Paulmann passed away in March. Paulmann founded retail giant Cencosud from a single supermarket in central Chile in 1963. When he died, the company had a presence in five countries in Latin America and brought in $17.5 billion in annual revenue. In 2022, he and his five siblings inherited their late father’s stake in Grupo BAL, a Mexican conglomerate that spans mining, retail and financial services. In June, Carlos Slim Helú’s Grupo Carso completed the acquisition of PetroBal Upstream, the group’s oil arm, for some $530 million. AFP via Getty Images Now Mexico’s third-richest person, Aramburuzabala inherited her father’s stake in beer producer Grupo Modelo following his 1995 death from lung cancer. Her fortune includes her sister’s and mom's shares in Tresalia Capital, the family’s investment vehicle, which has backed companies like Tory Burch and Casper Sleep. Aramburuzabala’s net worth is up by $2.7 billion this year after Forbes dug into the value of Tresalia’s real estate portfolio. Gabriel Rinaldi for Forbes In August, Velez sold 31 million shares of Nu Holdings, worth $404 million. The cofounder and CEO, who still owns 20% of the company’s stock, has big plans for Latin America’s largest fintech company. In January, he discussed plans to expand Nubank’s operations beyond the region, including a potential entry into the United States. The Colombian banker, who ties Velez for the title of the country’s richest person, built his fortune through a series of bold banking acquisitions and successful exits across Latin America. His latest deals: London-based Metro Bank, of which he became majority shareholder in 2023 and Colombian food processing conglomerate Grupo Nutresa. Gilinski, who had been increasing his stake in Grupo Nutresa since 2021, bought an additional 12% last year alongside his partner, Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Company. Getty Images Lemann cofounded private equity firm 3G Capital with fellow billionaires Carlos “Beto” Sicupira and Marcel Herrmann Telles in 2004, making highly lucrative and long-hold investments into food and beverage companies like Anheuser-Busch, H.J. Heinz & Company and Burger King. In recent years, the firm has ventured into other industries, including a 75% stake in Dutch window blinds maker Hunter Douglas. The inheritance saga plaguing the widow and children of Joseph Safra, once the richest banker in the world, has come to an end. "I am happy to put that matter behind. After clarifications, I understood that there were no wrongdoings, and that Mr. Safra's estate was properly disposed in accordance to his wishes,” son Alberto said in a joint statement with the family released in July. Alberto had previously sued his mother and siblings, claiming his stake in Safra National Bank of New York had been diluted after his father's passing. The widow of Andrónico Luksic (d. 2005) and his children are reportedly seeking nearly $230 million from Banco Santander and PwC related to losses from Banco Popular’s near-bankruptcy in 2017. Through Aeris Invest, the family had put around $125 million into Banco Popular shortly before Santander acquired it for just one euro after it was declared failing by the European Central Bank. Larrea built his fortune by expanding Grupo Mexico into a conglomerate with interests in transportation and infrastructure. The mining mogul, who took over as president and CEO in 1994, is one of only three Mexicans whose fortunes are up this year as the conglomerate’s revenue rose by nearly 13%, to $16.2 billion. Grupo Mexico’s mining division reported record revenues thanks to higher copper production and strong market conditions. Bryan van der Beek for Forbes The Facebook cofounder continues to reap the benefits of his Meta stake. Saverin’s wealth has increased by $6.5 billion as Meta’s stock continues to surge. Saverin, who resides in Singapore, topped Forbes’ Singapore’s 50 Richest list in September. Three months later, he and his wife donated $15 million to the Singapore American School. Martin Schoeller for Forbes Although he’s still among the world’s top 20 richest people, Slim’s drop to No. 19 overall marks the lowest he’s ranked since 2003. While shares of his biggest companies, América Móvil and Grupo Carso, were down over the past year, the telecommunications magnate has poured $1 billion into U.S. oil companies Talos Energy and PBF Energy.

Title: The $100 Billion Club: These 15 People Have 12-Figure Fortunes

ByMatt Durot ByMatt Durot, Forbes Staff. T he ultra-elite echelon of people with dozen-digit fortunes didn’t even exist eight years ago. Now, a record 15 people make the grade on Forbes’ 2025 World’s Billionaires list, up from 14 last year and six in 2023. For the first time, three of them have a net worth above $200 billion. In all, these 15 “centibillionaires” are worth $2.4 trillion, nearly $400 billion more than a year ago—and more than the planet’s 1,500 “poorest” billionaires combined. Put another way, this group of just 0.5% of the world’s 3,028 billionaires holds an incredible 15% of all billionaire wealth. In 1987, when Forbes published its first ever global rich list, the idea of a centibillionaire was hard to imagine. We found just two people, both Japanese tycoons, worth more than $10 billion (about $28 billion adjusted for inflation, good enough to rank just 71st on the 2025 list). It took the dot-com bubble to create the first centibillionaire, Bill Gates, whose Microsoft shares briefly lifted his fortune above $100 billion in 1999, before the ensuing crash chopped his net worth nearly in half. No one else came close for nearly two decades, even as markets soared before and after the Great Recession. Jeff Bezos finally cracked the code in late 2017, becoming the second ever centibillionaire, when Amazon’s market capitalization rocketed toward $1 trillion. Still, it wasn’t until 2021 that the $100 Billion Club expanded beyond Bezos, when Elon Musk, Bernard Arnault and Bill Gates joined its ranks. Now, with extreme affluence surging around the world, membership is getting (just a little bit) more common by the day. The three living children of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992) all joined the $100 Billion Club this year, replacing two members on last year’s list whose fortunes dropped back into 11 figures: Indian industrial tycoon Mukesh Ambani (estimated net worth: $92.5 billion) and Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu ($82.5 billion). Meanwhile, a number of other billionaires are knocking on the door, led by Nvidia’s Jensen Huang ($98.7 billion), tech tycoon Michael Dell ($97.7 billion) and L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers ($81.6 billion), who briefly became the first-ever female centibillionaire in June 2024. In September, Walton became the world’s wealthiest woman once again, overtaking French L’Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, who had surpassed her for the previous two and a half years. The Walmart heiress is best known for spearheading the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in her family’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. She has given away an estimated $1.7 billion, including a recent gift of $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, also in Bentonville. The cofounder of financial data and media company Bloomberg LP donated $1 billion to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, last July to make its medical school tuition free for most students. Altogether he has given $4.6 billion to the school, which announced in March that it will lay off more than 2,000 employees after the Trump administration canceled $800 million of federal grants. The Microsoft cofounder hasn’t ranked this low since 1991, when he was worth $4.4 billion. Microsoft stock is down 2% since last year, but the main reason for Gates’ $20 billion drop is Forbes’ increased estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement, which we peg at $25 billion. In his capacity as chairman of the $70 billion (net assets) Gates Foundation, he met with Trump in February to advocate for the U.S. Agency for International Development after the administration started slashing its workforce and programs. The self-described nerd also barnstormed the country that month, appearing on the Today show, The Tonight Show (and everything in between) to promote his recently published childhood memoir, Source Code. Three decades after Walmart founder Sam Walton’s death, his children are stepping back. In June, Rob, 80, retired from the retailing giant’s board after more than 40 years as a director. Jim, 76, left the board in 2016, but still chairs the family’s Arvest Bank Group. In December, the Waltons announced that all eight of Sam’s grandkids now share in the voting rights for the family’s 45% stake in Walmart. Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft 11 years ago but still raves about the stock, which accounts for an estimated 80% of his portfolio. It’s been a heck of an investment: MSFT shares have returned nearly 1,200% since he left the top job, quadrupling the S&P 500. Ballmer is also very emotionally invested in the L.A. Clippers, the basketball team he bought for $2 billion in 2014. Now moved into the shiny new Intuit Dome stadium that Ballmer spent some $2 billion building, it’s the NBA’s fifth most valuable team, worth $5.5 billion. Spain’s richest person has invested more than $1 billion in logistics and office properties across Europe over the past year. He can afford it: His stake in fashion retail giant Inditex, which he founded in 1985 and is best known for its Zara brand, is worth a record $100 billion, as shares swelled 27% over the past 12 months. Plus Ortega, who stepped down as chairman 14 years ago, has another $3.4 billion (pretax) coming his way, too, thanks to a fat dividend announced in March. The Alphabet cofounders and board members are richer this year due to a nearly 30% jump in Alphabet shares—despite the Justice Department’s demand that Google be broken up. Brin has reportedly been back in the office working on Alphabet’s Gemini family of AI models, and reportedly encouraged employees to do the same, penning a February memo urging in-office attendance. Page, meanwhile, is reportedly working on a new company to apply AI to manufacturing. The 94-year-old investor has amassed $334 billion of cash on Berkshire Hathaway’s books—and is in no hurry to spend it. Buffett was a net seller of $134 billion of equities in 2024 and hasn’t made a splashy acquisition since 2022’s $11.5 billion purchase of insurer Alleghany Corp. “Often, nothing looks compelling,” Buffett wrote in his annual shareholder letter in February. The richest person on the planet a year ago, Arnault has seen his fortune drop by $55 billion amid what the luxury goods giant has called “a challenging economic and geopolitical environment.” The 76-year-old father of five (all LVMH executives) seems to be having fun keeping everyone guessing as to his successor: Son Antoine was center stage for the group’s sponsorship of last summer’s Paris Olympics; son Frédéric was recently named chief of its Loro Piana fashion brand; and daughter Delphine and son Alexandre were seated with their father at Trump’s inauguration. Ellison wasn’t one of the tech tycoons front and center at Trump’s inauguration, but the next day he stood feet away from the president at the White House as Trump announced a $500 billion initiative to build AI infrastructure, including data centers, backed in part by Ellison’s firm Oracle. Ellison’s fortune is up $51 billion from 2024 due to a 40% rise in Oracle’s stock price. The Amazon founder and chairman is $21 billion richer than last year and keeping busy as an investor. Bezos, who offloaded $5 billion of Amazon shares over the past 12 months, has continued to pump cash into startups, including several AI robotics firms. His space outfit, Blue Origin, announced in February that it’s laying off 10% of its workforce, a month after the successful launch of its New Glenn rocket. Meanwhile his recent moves at another toy, the Washington Post, including declaring that the opinion pages must support “personal liberties and free markets,” have ruffled establishment feathers. The formerly progressive Meta CEO surprised many with his public embrace of MAGA, including putting pro-Trump entrepreneur Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, on Meta’s board in early January and cohosting an inauguration reception for the president alongside several Republican billionaires. Shares of the social media behemoth have surged nearly 25% over the past year amid optimism about Meta’s AI investments—enough to make Zuck the planet’s second-richest person for the first time. Musk reclaimed the title of world’s richest person from LVMH’s Bernard Arnault last May, when private investors valued Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, at $24 billion. Then, in December, he became the first person ever worth $400 billion, after xAI’s valuation doubled to $50 billion and Musk’s rocket maker, SpaceX, hit $350 billion (up from $210 billion in June). Shares of his EV company, Tesla, also reached an all-time high that month, but the stock has crashed by nearly 40% since inauguration day, when Musk took over as head of President Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Still, he’s worth $147 billion more than a year ago. And that’s before Musk announced last Friday that xAI had acquired his social media company X (formerly Twitter) in a deal that valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, or roughly what Musk paid for the platform in 2022.

Title: The $100 Billion Club: These 15 People Have 12-Figure Fortunes

ByMatt Durot ByMatt Durot, Forbes Staff. T he ultra-elite echelon of people with dozen-digit fortunes didn’t even exist eight years ago. Now, a record 15 people make the grade on Forbes’ 2025 World’s Billionaires list, up from 14 last year and six in 2023. For the first time, three of them have a net worth above $200 billion. In all, these 15 “centibillionaires” are worth $2.4 trillion, nearly $400 billion more than a year ago—and more than the planet’s 1,500 “poorest” billionaires combined. Put another way, this group of just 0.5% of the world’s 3,028 billionaires holds an incredible 15% of all billionaire wealth. In 1987, when Forbes published its first ever global rich list, the idea of a centibillionaire was hard to imagine. We found just two people, both Japanese tycoons, worth more than $10 billion (about $28 billion adjusted for inflation, good enough to rank just 71st on the 2025 list). It took the dot-com bubble to create the first centibillionaire, Bill Gates, whose Microsoft shares briefly lifted his fortune above $100 billion in 1999, before the ensuing crash chopped his net worth nearly in half. No one else came close for nearly two decades, even as markets soared before and after the Great Recession. Jeff Bezos finally cracked the code in late 2017, becoming the second ever centibillionaire, when Amazon’s market capitalization rocketed toward $1 trillion. Still, it wasn’t until 2021 that the $100 Billion Club expanded beyond Bezos, when Elon Musk, Bernard Arnault and Bill Gates joined its ranks. Now, with extreme affluence surging around the world, membership is getting (just a little bit) more common by the day. The three living children of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992) all joined the $100 Billion Club this year, replacing two members on last year’s list whose fortunes dropped back into 11 figures: Indian industrial tycoon Mukesh Ambani (estimated net worth: $92.5 billion) and Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu ($82.5 billion). Meanwhile, a number of other billionaires are knocking on the door, led by Nvidia’s Jensen Huang ($98.7 billion), tech tycoon Michael Dell ($97.7 billion) and L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers ($81.6 billion), who briefly became the first-ever female centibillionaire in June 2024. In September, Walton became the world’s wealthiest woman once again, overtaking French L’Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, who had surpassed her for the previous two and a half years. The Walmart heiress is best known for spearheading the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in her family’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. She has given away an estimated $1.7 billion, including a recent gift of $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, also in Bentonville. The cofounder of financial data and media company Bloomberg LP donated $1 billion to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, last July to make its medical school tuition free for most students. Altogether he has given $4.6 billion to the school, which announced in March that it will lay off more than 2,000 employees after the Trump administration canceled $800 million of federal grants. The Microsoft cofounder hasn’t ranked this low since 1991, when he was worth $4.4 billion. Microsoft stock is down 2% since last year, but the main reason for Gates’ $20 billion drop is Forbes’ increased estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement, which we peg at $25 billion. In his capacity as chairman of the $70 billion (net assets) Gates Foundation, he met with Trump in February to advocate for the U.S. Agency for International Development after the administration started slashing its workforce and programs. The self-described nerd also barnstormed the country that month, appearing on the Today show, The Tonight Show (and everything in between) to promote his recently published childhood memoir, Source Code. Three decades after Walmart founder Sam Walton’s death, his children are stepping back. In June, Rob, 80, retired from the retailing giant’s board after more than 40 years as a director. Jim, 76, left the board in 2016, but still chairs the family’s Arvest Bank Group. In December, the Waltons announced that all eight of Sam’s grandkids now share in the voting rights for the family’s 45% stake in Walmart. Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft 11 years ago but still raves about the stock, which accounts for an estimated 80% of his portfolio. It’s been a heck of an investment: MSFT shares have returned nearly 1,200% since he left the top job, quadrupling the S&P 500. Ballmer is also very emotionally invested in the L.A. Clippers, the basketball team he bought for $2 billion in 2014. Now moved into the shiny new Intuit Dome stadium that Ballmer spent some $2 billion building, it’s the NBA’s fifth most valuable team, worth $5.5 billion. Spain’s richest person has invested more than $1 billion in logistics and office properties across Europe over the past year. He can afford it: His stake in fashion retail giant Inditex, which he founded in 1985 and is best known for its Zara brand, is worth a record $100 billion, as shares swelled 27% over the past 12 months. Plus Ortega, who stepped down as chairman 14 years ago, has another $3.4 billion (pretax) coming his way, too, thanks to a fat dividend announced in March. The Alphabet cofounders and board members are richer this year due to a nearly 30% jump in Alphabet shares—despite the Justice Department’s demand that Google be broken up. Brin has reportedly been back in the office working on Alphabet’s Gemini family of AI models, and reportedly encouraged employees to do the same, penning a February memo urging in-office attendance. Page, meanwhile, is reportedly working on a new company to apply AI to manufacturing. The 94-year-old investor has amassed $334 billion of cash on Berkshire Hathaway’s books—and is in no hurry to spend it. Buffett was a net seller of $134 billion of equities in 2024 and hasn’t made a splashy acquisition since 2022’s $11.5 billion purchase of insurer Alleghany Corp. “Often, nothing looks compelling,” Buffett wrote in his annual shareholder letter in February. The richest person on the planet a year ago, Arnault has seen his fortune drop by $55 billion amid what the luxury goods giant has called “a challenging economic and geopolitical environment.” The 76-year-old father of five (all LVMH executives) seems to be having fun keeping everyone guessing as to his successor: Son Antoine was center stage for the group’s sponsorship of last summer’s Paris Olympics; son Frédéric was recently named chief of its Loro Piana fashion brand; and daughter Delphine and son Alexandre were seated with their father at Trump’s inauguration.

Title: The 10 Richest People In Latin America 2025

ByGigi Zamora ByGigi Zamora, Forbes Staff. There are a record-breaking 3,028 billionaires around the world, but only 95 hail from Latin America, down from 110 a year ago. This group of entrepreneurs, investors and heirs are worth a combined $484.3 billion, $46 billion less than in 2024. Brazil, which has the highest number of billionaires in the region, contributed largely to the decline, as the country faces economic headwinds and wrestles to combat inflation. Of the region’s 18 drop-offs, 15 were from Brazil, most notably including “Soybean King” Blairo Maggi, controlling shareholder of soybean producer Amaggi, and João Alves de Queiroz Filho, founder of Hypera Pharma. The country did manage to add two new faces this year, however, in Anheuser-Busch InBev heir Max Van Hoegaerden Herrmann Telles (estimated net worth: $5.8 billion) and renewable energies entrepreneur Mário Araripe ($3 billion). While Brazil lost the most billionaires in Latin America over the past year, Mexican billionaires lost the most money. A weakened peso—down 20% against the U.S. dollar—and a barrage of tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have helped push the combined wealth of Mexico’s richest people down by $36.9 billion, to an aggregate $167.1 billion. No one in the region lost more than Carlos Slim Helú ($82.5 billion), who shed $19.5 billion of his net worth, as shares of his telecommunications company América Móvil and his conglomerate Grupo Carso fell by 20% and 15%, respectively, amid exchange rate fluctuations; he dropped from No. 14 to No. 19 worldwide. Ricardo Salinas Pliego ($4.9 billion), who ranked last year as the seventh richest individual in the region and the third richest in Mexico, lost $8.5 billion as shares of his conglomerate Grupo Elektra plummeted 70% amid trading suspensions stemming from fraud allegations and debt disputes between Salinas’ companies and the Mexican government. To mitigate the drop in value, Grupo Elektra’s board decided to take the company private in late 2024; the transition is expected to be completed by May. Meanwhile, siblings Juan Domingo ($1.9 billion) and Karen Beckmann Legorreta ($1.3 billion), lost $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, as shares of Becle, the company behind the Jose Cuervo tequila brand, fell to a record low on March 4th, when tariffs for imports from Mexico, Canada and China went into effect. They were suspended two days later, but the stock has yet to rebound. Outside of Mexico and Brazil, things weren’t as grim. Strong performance from financial institutions brought an Argentinian banker (Delfín Jorge Ezequiel Carballo, $1.2 billion) and a Chilean banker (Luis Enrique Yarur Rey, $1.3 billion) back into the ranking, and upped the fortune of Venezuela’s richest person, Juan Carlos Escotet ($7.4 billion), by 68%. Another returnee is Eduardo Hochschild ($2.4 billion), chairman of the Peru-based family business Hochschild Group. The only Peruvian citizen on the list, he returns after an uptick in the group’s mining company stock price thanks to a return to profitability in 2024 and some hefty dividend payouts. Two notable Latin American billionaires died this year. Gregorio Pérez Companc, who transformed Grupo Perez Companc into one of Argentina’s largest conglomerates, died in June 2024. The tycoon had planned his succession in 2009 when he gave six of his children equal shares in the conglomerate's holding company. This year, three of the siblings bought out the rest. Luis, Rosario and Pilar Perez Companc are now the majority owners but none were individual billionaires when we finalized the list. And Chilean Horst Paulmann passed away in March. Paulmann founded retail giant Cencosud from a single supermarket in central Chile in 1963. When he died, the company had a presence in five countries in Latin America and brought in $17.5 billion in annual revenue. In 2022, he and his five siblings inherited their late father’s stake in Grupo BAL, a Mexican conglomerate that spans mining, retail and financial services. In June, Carlos Slim Helú’s Grupo Carso completed the acquisition of PetroBal Upstream, the group’s oil arm, for some $530 million. AFP via Getty Images Now Mexico’s third-richest person, Aramburuzabala inherited her father’s stake in beer producer Grupo Modelo following his 1995 death from lung cancer. Her fortune includes her sister’s and mom's shares in Tresalia Capital, the family’s investment vehicle, which has backed companies like Tory Burch and Casper Sleep. Aramburuzabala’s net worth is up by $2.7 billion this year after Forbes dug into the value of Tresalia’s real estate portfolio. Gabriel Rinaldi for Forbes In August, Velez sold 31 million shares of Nu Holdings, worth $404 million. The cofounder and CEO, who still owns 20% of the company’s stock, has big plans for Latin America’s largest fintech company. In January, he discussed plans to expand Nubank’s operations beyond the region, including a potential entry into the United States. The Colombian banker, who ties Velez for the title of the country’s richest person, built his fortune through a series of bold banking acquisitions and successful exits across Latin America. His latest deals: London-based Metro Bank, of which he became majority shareholder in 2023 and Colombian food processing conglomerate Grupo Nutresa. Gilinski, who had been increasing his stake in Grupo Nutresa since 2021, bought an additional 12% last year alongside his partner, Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Company. Getty Images Lemann cofounded private equity firm 3G Capital with fellow billionaires Carlos “Beto” Sicupira and Marcel Herrmann Telles in 2004, making highly lucrative and long-hold investments into food and beverage companies like Anheuser-Busch, H.J. Heinz & Company and Burger King. In recent years, the firm has ventured into other industries, including a 75% stake in Dutch window blinds maker Hunter Douglas. The inheritance saga plaguing the widow and children of Joseph Safra, once the richest banker in the world, has come to an end. "I am happy to put that matter behind. After clarifications, I understood that there were no wrongdoings, and that Mr. Safra's estate was properly disposed in accordance to his wishes,” son Alberto said in a joint statement with the family released in July. Alberto had previously sued his mother and siblings, claiming his stake in Safra National Bank of New York had been diluted after his father's passing. The widow of Andrónico Luksic (d. 2005) and his children are reportedly seeking nearly $230 million from Banco Santander and PwC related to losses from Banco Popular’s near-bankruptcy in 2017. Through Aeris Invest, the family had put around $125 million into Banco Popular shortly before Santander acquired it for just one euro after it was declared failing by the European Central Bank. Larrea built his fortune by expanding Grupo Mexico into a conglomerate with interests in transportation and infrastructure. The mining mogul, who took over as president and CEO in 1994, is one of only three Mexicans whose fortunes are up this year as the conglomerate’s revenue rose by nearly 13%, to $16.2 billion. Grupo Mexico’s mining division reported record revenues thanks to higher copper production and strong market conditions. Bryan van der Beek for Forbes The Facebook cofounder continues to reap the benefits of his Meta stake. Saverin’s wealth has increased by $6.5 billion as Meta’s stock continues to surge. Saverin, who resides in Singapore, topped Forbes’ Singapore’s 50 Richest list in September. Three months later, he and his wife donated $15 million to the Singapore American School. Martin Schoeller for Forbes Although he’s still among the world’s top 20 richest people, Slim’s drop to No. 19 overall marks the lowest he’s ranked since 2003. While shares of his biggest companies, América Móvil and Grupo Carso, were down over the past year, the telecommunications magnate has poured $1 billion into U.S. oil companies Talos Energy and PBF Energy.

March 31, 2025 19:28 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: YouTube’s Revenue Will Top Disney’s This Year As It Becomes “The Home For All Things Video”, Analyst Says

By Dade Hayes Business Editor YouTube‘s revenue will surpass Disney‘s this year, making it the top global player in media, according to a report by veteran Wall Street analyst Michael Nathanson. With $54.2 billion in revenue last year, the company is on pace to become No. 1 by the end of 2025, he predicts in a new report issued Monday. Because of its massive viewing, which has twice eclipsed that for Disney and other media giants according to Nielsen, the valuation for the former black sheep has continued moving skyward. “If YouTube was a standalone business, public comps suggest the business would be worth $475 to $550 billion, or about 30% of Alphabet’s current valuation,” wrote Nathanson, a partner in MoffettNathanson, in his annual report on YouTube, which anoints the company “king of all media.” (The value of Netflix and Meta Platforms, for comparison, are in a similar neighborhood.) Related Stories News Tariff Terror Grips Stock Market: Media Shares Ensnared In Second Day Of Steep Declines - Update News 'Zootopia 2' Charms CinemaCon As Ke Huy Quan Intros Scenes Of Judy Hopps & Nick Wilde In Therapy With Quinta Brunson's Dr. Fuzzby Despite his rhapsody about YouTube’s scale, growth and potential, Nathanson in the report actually lowered his 12-month price target on parent Alphabet’s shares by $10, putting it at $210. He reiterated the firm’s “buy” rating on the stock, however. Watch on Deadline Nathanson believes YouTube is just coming into its own as a seller of advertising in the living room. While the company has long touted growth of viewing of its content via a TV screen, confirming last month that it now has surpassed mobile, the ad marketplace is still catching up. Entrenched streaming ad purveyor Pluto is able to charge about 26 cents per hour of viewing, while YouTube is at about 18 cents, Nathanson estimates. “Given YouTube’s scaled reach and data advantage over other AVOD/FAST platforms, we believe YouTube is under-monetizing its engagement today and instead should be in a league of its own ahead of this comp group,” ahead of Tubi, Roku Channel and Pluto, the analyst writes. In addition to ad revenue upside, Nathanson continues, “YouTube is also positioned to become the home for all things video.” That projection is based on the company’s dominance across “three key buckets.” The report defines them as YouTube Premium & Music; YouTube TV, where the company recently surpassed 8 million subscribers, and “Other.” That last bucket includes YouTube Primetime Channels (including NFL Sunday Ticket), channel memberships, VOD, and creator monetization tools throwing off a share of proceeds to YouTube.

Title: Why Index Funds Are Out, And These 3 Big Dividends Are In

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Investment asset allocation and rebalance concept. In our Thursday article, we talked about a “quiet shift” in the markets, from growth stocks to value—and we named 2 CEFs yielding 9%+ that are primed to profit from it. Yes, the recent jump in volatility is a big reason for that. So today, we’re going to look at another side of the rotation we’re seeing—a shift from passive investing to active. As we move further into 2025, it’s getting clearer to me that we’re into a stock-picker’s market. Sitting in an index fund just won’t cut it. That said, at my CEF Insider service, we’re still bullish on stocks (and stock-focused closed-end funds, many of which hand us 8%+ yields), and we’ll get into two stock-focused funds, along with another that holds preferred stocks—kind of a stock/bond hybrid—below. Because there’s no question that success in this market will require active management—moving into, and out of, the right stocks and sectors at the right times. Of course, many mainstream investors aren’t interested in that—it’s too much work. Which is why I’m betting that many of them are likely to give CEFs a closer look as we move further into 2025. As they do, they’ll discover what we’ve known at CEF Insider for years: CEFs let you sit back and collect high yields (and price upside) while “farming out” picking the actual investments to a professional human manager. That makes now a great time to pick up some well-run CEFs as active management (finally) regains appeal. Doing so lets us buy our CEFs at a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios), especially in the wake of the recent selloff. Then, as more investors pile in, we get to ride along as those discounts shrink, pulling our CEFs’ market prices higher as they do. Which brings me back to those three CEFs I mentioned off the top—the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG)—a CEF Insider holding—the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW) and the Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred and Income Securities Fund (FFC). All are trading at discounts and boast dividends that are either sky-high (9.4% in the case of ASG) or set to grow (like STEW’s 4%-yielding payout). ASG is a multi-manager fund that invests in large-, mid- and small-cap growth stocks. This means it leverages the knowledge of experts in different sectors (tech, financial, etc.), as well as experts with experience investing in big companies, small companies and everything in between. ASG is interesting now because, in a sense, it gives us two discounts. The first is the fund’s discount to NAV, which is 7.9% as I write this, even though the fund has delivered an 8.4% annualized total return over the last decade, based on its market price, as of this writing. That 7.9% discount is well below its five-year average of 1%, which is our first discount here. The other one is on the fund’s stocks themselves, and we can see the recent dip in those by looking at its NAV performance, including dividends. That’s entirely the result of the last few weeks of volatility: ASG Total Returns Meantime, ASG offers a rich 9.4% dividend yield. Unlike ETFs, which typically provide minimal yield, ASG’s managed-distribution policy (meaning ASG management can raise or lower payouts depending on what’s best for the fund’s long-term returns. Moreover, ASG’s overall yield is actually higher than it looks, since management regularly pays special dividends. ASG Dividend With a discount to NAV and a dip in its portfolio performance, ASG is set up to gain as more investors “farm out” their stock picking. Buy it now and we could collect that 9.4% “base” payout in the meantime. Next up is the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW), which sports one of the biggest discounts in CEFs, at 23.1%. That’s wild when you consider that STEW delivered a tidy 12.7% annualized return over the last decade. Moreover, that 23.1% discount is nearly five percentage points wider than STEW’s long-term average of 18.2%. STEW Discount STEW’s top holdings include Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), which comprises nearly 40% of the portfolio between the two share classes, as well as other well-known large caps, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and pipeline master limited partnership (MLP) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD). So, why is this fund trading at such a deep discount? Simply put: neglect. STEW doesn’t have the same name recognition as some larger CEFs. But with markets now rewarding active strategies and investors looking to large caps during this volatility, that’s set to change. STEW is also valuable because management can put 40% of their portfolio in stocks like BRK when they’re undervalued, while SEC rules limit passive funds to stick to no more than about 10% of their assets in any one holding. Once investors pick up on STEW’s strong performance and deep discount, the gap should narrow. And with a very well-covered dividend, you’re very likely to see higher payouts over time, building on the 4% yield you’d get on a buy made today. In fact, history strongly suggests that’s exactly what’ll happen here: STEW Dividend Just in the past five years, STEW’s payout has jumped 62%, and as you can see at the right of this chart, its payout growth is accelerating. That bodes well for anyone buying this bargain-priced CEF today. The Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Securities Income Fund (FFC) holds preferred shares, which trade on an exchange, like stocks, and represent ownership in a company. But their price movements are more like those of bonds. And, like bonds, they’re sensitive to interest rates. More on that in a second. Banks and insurance companies are the main issuers of preferreds, which is why 54% of FFC’s portfolio consists of financial services firms, with preferreds from the likes of Wells Fargo and MetLife. That’s something to keep in mind when you’re considering how FFC fits into your overall portfolio weighting. Beyond that, the fund is a good way to pick up a basket of preferreds and lock in a 6.8% yield while doing so. FFC Dividend Above you can see the rate sensitivity of FFC’s dividend in action, with the payout moving lower as rates rose in 2022 and 2023, then steadying and rising as rates topped out and began to move lower (along with a special dividend late last year). Here’s what makes FFC particularly interesting now: It historically trades at a premium to NAV of 1%, but it’s currently at a 5.8% discount. That’s a big break from its norm, and it’s unlikely to last. Preferred securities tend to do well when rates are stabilizing, and that’s where we are now, with Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell saying he’s content to hold off on further cuts until the effects of Trump administration policies (especially around tariffs) become clearer. Even so, the latest projections from the Federal Open Market Committee do still indicate that two rate cuts are expected in 2025, probably toward the end of the year. When that happens, preferreds will benefit, and funds like FFC are likely to see renewed interest—which I see pushing the fund’s discount back toward a premium. That leaves us with FFC’s 6.8% dividend (with potential for more payout growth) to collect while we wait. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Stocks close out their worst quarter since 2022 amid tariff uncertainty

Time Published: 2025-03-31T21:25:21Z
Full Content:
Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Two of the three major U.S. stock indexes just wrapped up their worst quarter in well over two years. The third barely avoided the same fate. The S&P 500 dropped more than 4.5% for the first quarter of 2025 as of Monday’s close, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 10.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 1.3% lower and recorded its first back-to-back monthly loss since October 2023. The declines on all three indexes come days before President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new slate of wide-ranging tariffs, extending ongoing trade policy turmoil that has kept investors guessing for months. The broad-based S&P 500 fell briefly into correction territory Monday, meaning a 10% slide from its last high. The index regained some ground late in the day, but not enough to dodge its worst monthly percentage drop since December 2022. The index’s first-quarter stumbles ended a streak of five straight winning quarters, while the Nasdaq wiped out more than half of last year’s gains over the last three months. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta, known on Wall Street as the “magnificent 7,” have lost more than $2 trillion in market value collectively since the start of the year. The last time U.S. markets stumbled as badly was in the middle of 2022 after Russia’s late-February invasion of Ukraine, shocking the global economy as Western nations hit Moscow with severe sanctions and commodities like oil and grains shot up in price. The first quarter of this year saw geopolitical upheaval of a different sort, as investors have struggled to digest the series of major U.S. policy changes since Inauguration Day. The quarter marked the S&P’s worst performance versus the rest of the world since 1980, according to Dow Jones — at a time when a number of foreign stock markets have surged. The Euro Stoxx 600 index, which tracks companies across 17 countries, has risen 5% to start the year as the S&P 500 dropped by roughly the same amount. In fact, the Stoxx 600 has just had its best quarter against the S&P since 2015, according to FactSet data. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 also rose more than 5% in the same period. The MSCI China index, a benchmark of 580 Chinese stocks, ended the first quarter up 16%. Markets overseas have popped for a range of reasons, with some but not all related to the Trump administration’s actions. The European Union and U.K. have taken steps to trim regulations and hike military spending in response to White House moves, boosting shares of defense companies in both places and helping power markets there overall. In China, the strong performance has been more a reflection of local factors, including economic stimulus and enthusiasm around home-grown AI startups. It’s not a rosy picture everywhere, though. Japan’s flagship stock index sank 10% in the first quarter over fears about slowing manufacturing and an export economy that could be hurt by Trump’s still-expanding tariff agenda. The president is set to open another front in his trade war Wednesday, a date he has dubbed America’s “Liberation Day” from the purported abuses of its top trading partners, many of them longtime allies. Trump has vowed so-called reciprocal tariffs aimed at equalizing trade barriers between the U.S. and a number of countries that sell to Americans more of their own goods and services than those they buy from the U.S. But with the details of this policy program still up in the air days before it’s set to roll out, business leaders and consumers have been grappling with widespread uncertainty over the coming impact. Nearly 900 nonfinancial companies mentioned tariffs on recent earnings calls, S&P Global Market Intelligence said this month. “This is truly ridiculous,” one manufacturing executive said in an anonymous Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey published Monday. “I have been in business for 50 years as of next year, and never have I seen such uncertainty in the market. It is very difficult to plan and make decisions.” But things could still turn around in the months ahead, some analysts say. “Once tariffs are announced on April 2, negotiations to soften them can begin,” researchers at the investment bank UBS said in a note to clients Monday. “Progress toward a budget reconciliation bill could refocus attention on market-positive aspects of the Trump agenda.” Steve Kopack is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Does CoreWeave's disappointing IPO signal an AI bubble?
URL: https://qz.com/coreweave-ipo-ai-bubble-1851773579
Time Published: 2025-03-31T19:29:00Z
Full Content:
New Jersey-based AI and cloud computing company CoreWeave made its market debut on Friday to little applause. The stock was poised for success by all means: It was the biggest tech IPO since software company UiPath (PATH-2.00%) in 2021, and a rare IPO of a pure-play AI company. Plus, it was backed by market-favorite tech giant Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%), which ended up having to anchor the IPO last minute with a $250 million order. But things didn’t pan out as expected. The company had initially targeted a $2.7 billion raise but ended up coming in at $1.5 billion instead. The shares priced at $40, well below the $47 to $50 price range expected previously, and started trading on Friday at $39. On Monday, the stock’s second day of trading, the shares were down almost 10% in midday trading. CoreWeave is a cloud computing company that provides GPU infrastructure to major tech names like Microsoft (MSFT-2.15%) and Meta (META-3.35%). The company primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs to run these data centers. Due to the costly nature of the business, CoreWeave relies on accumulating debt to build its capacity, relying on future demand for AI computing power. CoreWeave is considered a pure-play AI company because the company’s success bets directly on the future of AI demand growth. Most pure-play AI companies — like OpenAI, which kicked off the AI craze in 2022 with ChatGPT — are privately held and don’t publicly disclose finances, which makes it tough for investors to have a gauge on the industry as a whole. CoreWeave’s market debut was seen by many as a way to understand how the AI trade was going amidst rising fears of an AI bubble. Some industry experts think the stock’s disappointing IPO should be an indicator that the hype is subsiding. “[If] a year ago CoreWeave had gone public, the words ‘AI’ and ‘Nvidia’ would have been enough to carry it over the line. The fact that it’s not able to do it now is an indicator that the momentum of just trading based on the words AI or Nvidia are not working anymore,” NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance Aswath Damodaran told CNBC last week, adding that he thinks that’s healthy and that AI has been hyped a bit too much. “The AI product and service business, which ultimately is what has to pay for all of this, has not taken off in any substantial way. I mean, I’m hard pressed to think about any company making significant money from the AI product and service business,” Damodaran said. For its part, OpenAI expects revenue to more than triple by the end of this year, according to revenue expectations reported by Bloomberg last week, but the company doesn’t anticipate to be cash-flow positive until 2029. Market skepticism of the AI trade began late last year, Damodaran said, and accelerated when Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets by unveiling a reasoning model that rivaled OpenAI’s for less cost and energy earlier this year. What happened last week with the CoreWeave IPO, Damodaran says, is the market recognizing that “too much money” has been spent “too far in advance of the actual evidence that the market exists.” “I think we’re at that moment in the AI business where we’re looking for some evidence that AI product and service business will be trillions of dollars rather than hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said. Not all experts agree that the IPO’s disappointment has a direct correlation with the power of the AI trade, though. “While the CoreWeave IPO clearly did not go well, it should not be taken as an indication of the strength of the market for AI,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Quartz. Luria thinks that CoreWeave is “a little more than a highly leveraged off balance sheet arrangement for Nvidia,” pointing to Nvidia’s decision to bail out the company’s IPO. CoreWeave’s leveraged spending helps fuel Nvidia’s GPU sales without putting any direct financial risk on Nvidia. In an initiation note last week, Luria said CoreWeave’s debt-based business model can only be sustainable as long as demand for AI grows “faster than hyperscalers are able to build data centers,” making CoreWeave a risky investment as is. Regarding speculations of whether or not AI is in a bubble, Luria makes an analogy to the 2008 financial crisis, in which collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) — particularly, subprime mortgages — played a huge role in creating a housing bubble. “If AI was a CDO, we see CoreWeave as the sub-prime tranche,” Luria wrote. D.A. Davidson currently has a neutral rating on the stock. “The importance of AI to the future path of technology transcends any one company, and is definitely bigger than CoreWeave,” Luria told Quartz.

CoreWeave is a cloud computing company that provides GPU infrastructure to major tech names like Microsoft (MSFT-2.15%) and Meta (META-3.35%). The company primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs to run these data centers. Due to the costly nature of the business, CoreWeave relies on accumulating debt to build its capacity, relying on future demand for AI computing power. CoreWeave is considered a pure-play AI company because the company’s success bets directly on the future of AI demand growth. Most pure-play AI companies — like OpenAI, which kicked off the AI craze in 2022 with ChatGPT — are privately held and don’t publicly disclose finances, which makes it tough for investors to have a gauge on the industry as a whole. CoreWeave’s market debut was seen by many as a way to understand how the AI trade was going amidst rising fears of an AI bubble. Some industry experts think the stock’s disappointing IPO should be an indicator that the hype is subsiding. “[If] a year ago CoreWeave had gone public, the words ‘AI’ and ‘Nvidia’ would have been enough to carry it over the line. The fact that it’s not able to do it now is an indicator that the momentum of just trading based on the words AI or Nvidia are not working anymore,” NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance Aswath Damodaran told CNBC last week, adding that he thinks that’s healthy and that AI has been hyped a bit too much. “The AI product and service business, which ultimately is what has to pay for all of this, has not taken off in any substantial way. I mean, I’m hard pressed to think about any company making significant money from the AI product and service business,” Damodaran said. For its part, OpenAI expects revenue to more than triple by the end of this year, according to revenue expectations reported by Bloomberg last week, but the company doesn’t anticipate to be cash-flow positive until 2029. Market skepticism of the AI trade began late last year, Damodaran said, and accelerated when Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets by unveiling a reasoning model that rivaled OpenAI’s for less cost and energy earlier this year. What happened last week with the CoreWeave IPO, Damodaran says, is the market recognizing that “too much money” has been spent “too far in advance of the actual evidence that the market exists.” “I think we’re at that moment in the AI business where we’re looking for some evidence that AI product and service business will be trillions of dollars rather than hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said. Not all experts agree that the IPO’s disappointment has a direct correlation with the power of the AI trade, though. “While the CoreWeave IPO clearly did not go well, it should not be taken as an indication of the strength of the market for AI,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Quartz. Luria thinks that CoreWeave is “a little more than a highly leveraged off balance sheet arrangement for Nvidia,” pointing to Nvidia’s decision to bail out the company’s IPO. CoreWeave’s leveraged spending helps fuel Nvidia’s GPU sales without putting any direct financial risk on Nvidia. In an initiation note last week, Luria said CoreWeave’s debt-based business model can only be sustainable as long as demand for AI grows “faster than hyperscalers are able to build data centers,” making CoreWeave a risky investment as is. Regarding speculations of whether or not AI is in a bubble, Luria makes an analogy to the 2008 financial crisis, in which collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) — particularly, subprime mortgages — played a huge role in creating a housing bubble. “If AI was a CDO, we see CoreWeave as the sub-prime tranche,” Luria wrote. D.A. Davidson currently has a neutral rating on the stock. “The importance of AI to the future path of technology transcends any one company, and is definitely bigger than CoreWeave,” Luria told Quartz.

Title: Dividend Investing For Beginners In 4 Simple Steps

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Dividend investing can be fun and financially rewarding. Dividend investing does not have to be intimidating or complicated. It only takes some quick learning and a few easy steps to start building your passive dividend income stream. Dividend investing can be fun and financially rewarding. The fun happens when dividend payments hit your account every quarter or month. The financial rewards—which are ongoing—include two forms of returns, rising income and low volatility. Dividend-paying securities provide cash income plus appreciation potential. Together, earned dividends and price gains comprise your total return. Total return is an important metric for comparing dividend-payers to securities that don’t pay dividends. Dividend-paying securities often produce lower total returns than growth stocks. This makes sense because their risk is lower. With a dividend payer, the income is yours once it lands in your account. It cannot be rescinded, and you can use the cash to reinvest. Many growth securities do not pay dividends. They only provide appreciation gains which you earn when their price rises. Those gains are not permanent and can change quickly if the stock price falls. Some dividend securities provide ongoing income that rises over time. Rising income is a valuable offset to inflation, particularly in retirement—when you don’t have the opportunity to get a raise at work. Dividend stocks are categorized by how many consecutive years they have raised their shareholder payouts: These companies can cancel or reduce their dividend at any point, so their current status does not guarantee future income. Therefore, diversification is important. When your income portfolio is diversified, you are less dependent on one company’s dividend policy. Not every company can pay dividends consistently for decades. This achievement requires: These same qualities encourage low stock-price volatility and relatively consistent earnings. This is why some of the best dividend-paying stocks are blue-chip companies. Blue-chip describes large, financially strong companies with recognizable brand names such as Chevron (CVX), IBM (IBM) and Walmart (WMT). Even if you’ve never invested before, you can start dividend investing in four simple steps. You’ll choose an account, pick your asset type, invest and automate. Earned dividends are taxable, even if you reinvest them. Many domestic stocks pay qualified dividends, which are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate. Nonqualified dividends are taxed at the higher ordinary income tax rate. You can defer the annual federal tax obligation by holding your dividend payers in a tax-advantaged account. 401(k)s, IRAs, HSAs and 529 plans provide tax deferrals on investment earnings. Tax-advantaged accounts have withdrawal restrictions, which can be good or bad depending on your goals. If you are investing to build retirement income, then it makes sense to hold dividend securities in an IRA or 401(k). If you prefer to access the income sooner than retirement, a regular brokerage account or direct investment with the company will do. In this case, remember to plan for a higher tax bill each year. Next, you will pick which types of security you prefer. This may be an easy choice if you invest in a 401(k) with limited investment options. In accounts with broad access to publicly traded securities, you can choose from individual stocks, REITs and funds. Stocks Stocks are ownership shares of publicly traded companies. The dividend payments represent your share of profits. REITs REIT stands for real estate investment trust. These entities own and manage real estate. Special tax treatment requires REITs to pay 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. Funds Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) are investment portfolios that sell shares. As a fund shareholder, you earn when the portfolio produces income or increases in value. Many funds focus on dividend-paying securities to provide income for their shareholders. Examples include Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) and Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV). There are also REIT funds, such as iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (USRT) and SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR). Next, you will research your options and place your first trade order. You can prepare for this step by deciding whether to prioritize dividend yield or income consistency. Dividend yield measures income efficiency. It is calculated as the annual dividend payment divided by the share price. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a blue-chip index, pays an average dividend yield of 1.82%. Some stocks and REITs pay much higher yields, but the payments may vary over time. If you are not yet comfortable analyzing a stock or REIT's yield, dividend track record and financial health, opt for a fund with a low expense ratio and 100 or more securities in its portfolio. Consistent, recurring investments help you grow your dividend portfolio and income potential faster. Consider setting a monthly investing budget and automating those trades in your investment account. You can also reinvest your dividend payments automatically. This allows you to raise your income potential through compounding, which happens when your investment earnings generate more earnings. Many brokerage accounts allow for automatic dividend reinvestment. If yours doesn't, look for stocks or funds that offer direct investment and free dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP). Direct stock purchase plans are managed through the company rather than a broker. They may have lower fees than brokerage accounts, but the shares can be harder to sell. Computershare is a good resource for researching DRIPs. With the right investments, your dividend program can be low-maintenance and self-propelling. Opt for stocks or REITs with long and consistent dividend track records and low-fee funds emphasizing dividend reliability. Invest often, reinvest your dividends and watch your income potential grow over time.

Title: Nvidia To Invest Billions In U.S. Supply Chain As Tech Companies Commit To Trump's Onshoring Pledge

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Leading artificial intelligence chip maker Nvidia NVDA plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. supply chain over the next four years. CEO Jensen Huang told the Financial Times that the increased U.S. production was being made possible thanks to suppliers such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM and Foxconn FXCOF. “Overall, we will procure, over the course of the next four years, probably half a trillion dollars worth of electronics in total,” Huang told the FT. “And I think we can easily see ourselves manufacturing several hundred billion of it here in the U.S.” Don't Miss: Huang, speaking on March 18 during his company’s GTC convention, believed the Trump administration’s “America First” policy would enable his company to ramp up chip production in the U.S. “Having the support of an administration who cares about the success of this industry and not allowing energy to be an obstacle is a phenomenal result for AI in the U.S.,” he told the FT. Huang’s sentiments follow pledges by other tech companies to onshore manufacturing in the U.S. rather than overseas. Apple has committed to spending $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, expanding teams and facilities in Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. Trending: Invest in the Future of Digital Engagement. Own a Piece of the $100 Billion Metaverse Today for Just $500. TSMC has already committed a $100 billion investment in a chip fabrication plant in Arizona, which President Donald Trump has said would create thousands of jobs bringing Taiwan Semiconductor’s investment to "about $165 billion." “TSMC investing in the U.S. provides for a substantial step up in our supply chain resilience,” Huang told the FT. TSMC’s Taiwan-based production facilities have been an increasingly pivotal part of Nvidia and Apple’s manufacturing process, which Trump was once keen to change, previously threatening to impose tariffs on Taiwan. By pledging to build new facilities in the U.S., Trump said that Taiwan avoided a 25% tariff. “TSMC already has plants in the US and Japan, and it’s now building a new plant in Germany,” Taiwanese presidential office spokesperson Karen Kuo told the Guardian. “These have nothing to do with tariffs. TSMC’s global expansion is a crucial development.” See Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now. Trump has been basking in a wave of tech commitments to manufacture products in the U.S. “GE Aerospace GE announced on Tuesday a nearly $1 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, the latest company to do so under the Trump administration… It marks the latest company to put money back into the U.S. economy,” Trump said. Other tech companies or those that finance them have also announced big U.S.-based investments. Meta META has announced a $65 billion investment, most of which will be used to construct new data centers to fuel its AI operations. This follows investments from Google, Microsoft MSFT, and Amazon AMZN in data centers as the AI arms race heats up. Trump has announced a joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle ORCL called Stargate, which aims to invest at least $100 billion in U.S. data centers. Many of these data centers will house the incredibly powerful GPU computers powering the AI revolution. Nvidia currently has between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market used in GPUs.

Title: Rivian’s Micromobility Incubator ‘Also’ Gets Surprise Debut

ByWilliam Roberson ByWilliam Roberson, Contributor. LAGUNA BEACH, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 07: Founder and CEO of Rivian RJ Scaringe speaks onstage during the ... More Rivian Reveals All-Electric R2 Midsize SUV event at Rivian South Coast Theater on March 07, 2024 in Laguna Beach, California. (Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Rivian) Recently, when Rivian electric car company founder Robert “RJ” Scaringe introduced the R2S SUV and R2T pickup truck, he paid homage to Apple founder Steve Jobs’ iconic “one more thing” end-of-presentation-surprise strategy. Scaringe introduced not one unexpected vehicle—the R3—but also a second variant, the R3X, which has the automotive segment excited even though the new models are still a year or so from production. Watch the wink to Jobs at the 27:45 mark: Now, Scaringe and Rivian have announced another unexpected thing: a micromobility development company called Also, Inc. The products from Also will skew more toward personal use, although some micromobility products—especially e-bikes—are quickly becoming staples of the delivery industry, with workers contracting with companies such as Uber Eats, Doordash and others. Rivian has also produced tens of thousands of distinctive electric delivery vans for Amazon.com and recently began offering the vans for public sale. “Also will focus on small, lightweight vehicles that are designed to meet the global mobility transportation challenges of today and tomorrow,” Rivian said in a press release, with Scaringe adding “for the world to fully transition to electrified transportation, a range of vehicle types and form factors will be needed.” Also will be its own company, but will work closely with Rivian, much like Harley-Davidson and its e-moto spinoff LiveWire and Royal Enfield with its new electric motorcycle company Flying Flea (below). Chris Yu, Rivian’s VP of future programs, will be president of Also, according to Rivian’s press release. Additional funding for Also totaling over $100 million will come from investment company Eclipse, which is currently working with dozens of small tech startups. Other partners, so far unnamed, are reportedly involved. No specific products or timelines have been announced as of yet, but Scaringe has a history of paying attention to the mobility market, even while developing his full-size vehicles. According to tech tracking site TechCrunch, Scaringe will show an initial vehicle later this year, and strongly hinted it will be an affordable e-bike. TechCrunch said Scaringe and Rivian growth director and Eclipse partner Jiten Behl started talking about developing micromobility products just ahead of the pandemic. During the Covid years, TechCrunch said Christ Yu from bicycle and e-bike maker Specialized joined the effort. Bloomberg posted in early 2023 that Rivian was working on an e-bike, but details were scant. Scaringe founded Rivian in 2009, one year after Tesla began production of its first model, the original Lotus-based Roadster. Rivian went public in late 2021 with a stock price near $130 per share, giving the company a massive market cap before they had produced many commercial vehicles. The first Rivian R1T electric pickup for commercial sale rolled off the assembly line in September of that year. The stock fell as the pandemic wore on and excitement over EVs waned. Rivian CEO Robert "RJ" Scaringe speaks at the unveiling of the Rivian R3X (R) and R3 electric ... More vehicles at the Rivian South Coast Theater in Laguna Beach, California, on March 7, 2024. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Today, Rivian shares remain in the teens and production continues for the company’s latest generation of R1S and R1T vehicles as well as the distinctive electric delivery vans. Rivian’s market cap has hovered around $10 to $20 billion since 2022, and the company turned its first official profit—$170 million—in the last quarter of 2024 after years of heavy losses as production scaled up. With many prospective EV buyers souring on Tesla vehicles due to CEO Elon Musk’s political involvement, Rivian’s profile has risen as of late. With President Trump’s fairly antagonistic relationship with (most) electric vehicles and a possible end of tax incentives of EV buyers, the move to release Also into the wild might be timely if the vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and not affected by tariffs. The vast majority of e-bikes, electric scooters and other micromobility products are manufactured in China, putting them at risk of price increases due to tariffs. Scaringe told TechCrunch he thinks many e-bikes are overpriced; a competitive domestic product with no tariff charges could have legs (or wheels) if production can scale quickly and import tariffs remain in place.

Title: Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are tackling heart health next

After revolutionizing the weight-loss drug market, Novo Nordisk (NVO-6.13%) and Eli Lilly (LLY-5.60%) are setting their sights on heart health. Both pharma giants unveiled new clinical trial results over the weekend, highlighting potential cardiovascular benefits of their medications. Novo Nordisk shared fresh data on semaglutide — the active ingredient in its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. One study found that a weekly 2.4 mg dose led to a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events — such as heart attack, stroke, or death — among overweight or obese patients with existing cardiovascular disease, compared with a control group. Another study examined its daily semaglutide pill, Rybelsus, which showed a 14% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and some combination of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, compared with a placebo. Novo Nordisk’s chief rival, Eli Lilly, also released new heart health data. It said its experimental drug lepodisiran lowered levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) — a particle linked to cardiovascular disease — by 94% with a single injection. About 20% of Americans have high levels of Lp(a), which can double the risk of a heart attack and is linked with conditions like stroke and aortic valve stenosis. However, it remains unclear whether lowering Lp(a) levels translates into fewer heart attacks and strokes and large-scale clinical trials are underway to answer that question. These latest findings build on previous efforts by both companies to explore their medications’ effects on heart health. “Novo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,” Martin Holst Lange, the company’s executive vice president for development, said in a press release. Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded Wegovy’s approved use after Novo Nordisk announced that the drug cut the risk of serious heart events by 20% in a clinical trial. Meanwhile, in August, Lilly said that tirzepatide — the active ingredient in its weight-loss drug Zepbound — helped reduce heart failure risks in obese patients. Patients who took tirzepatide were 38% less likely to be hospitalized, require increased heart failure medication, or die from heart failure compared than those who received a placebo. Novo Nordisk’s shares gained 0.9% in U.S. trading on Monday, while Eli Lilly’s stock declined about 1%. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR MERCK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 30, 2024, Merck released its second quarter 2024 financial report and disclosed a significant reduction in Gardasil vaccinations, resulting in an overabundance of inventory at Merck’s Chinese distributor. The Company announced that its shipments of Gardasil to China may fall below contracted levels for 2024. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $12.53, or 9.8%, to close at $115.25 per share on July 30, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 4, 2025, Merck disclosed that it would entirely cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory,” citing a continued over-inflation of channel inventories as demand in China had “not recovered to the level [the Company] had expected.” Merck also announced that it would no longer achieve its long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Merck securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 14, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

CoreWeave's life as a publicly traded company is off to a rough start. The Nvidia-backed (NVDA) cloud-computing company managed to finish Friday, its first day of trading, in line with its IPO price and up from where it opened the session. On Monday morning, though, CoreWeave (CRWV) stock was pulled lower as markets slid. Shares of CoreWeave were recently down about 9% to under $37, below the $39 at which it opened trading last week. Part of the pullback is likely due to broader market concern, with investors jittery about what might happen later this week with the Trump administration tariff policy. That unease has lately weighed on tech shares, among them those associated with artificial intelligence, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the major indexes lower in recent trading today. The company in its IPO sold fewer shares, and at a lower price, than it originally hoped. One backer: the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), which on Friday said it had acquired more than 400,000 shares. “There’s a lot of headwinds in the macro. There are headwinds in the AI trade," CEO Mike Intrator said on CNBC Friday. "We definitely had to scale, or right-size, the transaction for where the buy interest was.”

Title: Tesla's first-quarter deliveries are likely to miss the mark, according to analysts

Tesla (TSLA-8.68%) investors should brace themselves for first-quarter sales that fail to impress, analysts say, as the backlash over Elon Musk’s politics and his role in mass layoffs take a toll on the company. Analysts on average expect Tesla on Wednesday to report deliveries of 408,000 electric vehicles for the January to March quarter, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-3.91%). Several analysts have downgraded their expectations to below 400,000 in recent weeks, as domestic protests against Tesla have raged and international sales slumped. Deutsche Bank (DB-9.66%) analysts last week reduced its first-quarter forecast by about 50,000 units to 345,000 deliveries, which would translate to an 11% year-over-year drop and a 30% decrease from the previous quarter. Deutsche also lowered its full-year estimate to 1.7 million units sold from 2.1 million units, a 5% decline compared to 2024. Tesla has forecasted a “return to growth” in 2025 after narrowly missing its 2024 sales goal and recording its first annual sales decline. In October, Musk forecasted sales growth of 30% for 2025. “The main drivers of the downside are weakness in Europe and the Model Y Juniper changeover,” analysts led by Edison Yu said, referring to Tesla’s updated electric SUV. Tesla’s sales in the European Union fell 49% in January and February compared to a year earlier, according to the European Automobile Manufacturer’s Association, with just 19,000 units registered. JATO Dynamics found that registrations of Tesla’s best-selling Model Y and Model 3 fell by 65% and 14%, respectively, in February. In China, where domestic automakers including BYD (BYDDY-7.82%) and Xiaomi (XIACF-7.94%) are growing their share of the market and electrified-vehicle sales are soaring, Tesla’s sales fell 49% year-over-year in February. The firm sold 30,688 vehicles, its lowest monthly figure since July 2022. Tesla has struggled to launch its advanced driver assistance technology in China, even as BYD plans to attach its “God’s Eye” software to just about all vehicles it sells. Some Chinese automakers are also able to sell their cars for dirt cheap. In the U.S., RBC Capital Markets (RY-2.84%) thinks Tesla will report 152,000 vehicles sold, according to a March 27 note. Analysts expect to see sales slammed by the recent string of protests against Tesla, which organizers view as an extension of Musk and his influence. Thousands have joined the “Takedown Tesla” demonstrations organized to protest Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, while critical owners of Tesla stock — and other investors fearing a crash — have been selling their shares. Acts of vandalism against Tesla facilities and vehicles have become more frequent, even pushing Tesla out of a major Canadian auto show whose organizers were worried about backlash. Forty-seven percent of voters surveyed by NBC News (CMCSA-5.47%) earlier this month had a negative view of DOGE, while 51% had a negative view of Musk himself. DOGE, however, was more popular, with 46% calling it a good idea and 40% saying it was bad. Telsa shares hit a record price of $479.86 at its post-election fueled peak on Dec. 17, but most of those gains have since been wiped out. The stock has fallen by more than 34% year-to-date, sending Musk’s net worth down $102 billion to $330 billion. Shares are down almost 6% in intraday trading on Monday. “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” JPMorgan (JPM-6.59%) analysts recently wrote of DOGE’s impact on Tesla. But it’s still unclear how much that brand damage — which began with Musk’s support of Trump during the 2024 election — will impact sales. Deutsche analysts, for example, noted that they believe “there is some level of brand damage” happening in Western Europe and “pockets” of the U.S. and Canada, but quantifying it is trickier to tell. Musk’s years-long shift toward the right wing had already irritated some potential customers with opposing views. In EV-friendly California, traditionally Tesla’s biggest domestic market, sales have dropped for five straight quarters. Just 13% of Democrats would consider buying a Tesla, according to a February Morning Consult poll. Conservatives, meanwhile, have embraced Musk; Trump has bought himself a Model S and his administration has promised to treat people vandalizing Tesla facilities as domestic terrorists. It’s still unclear how their support will translate into sales. Tesla will report its sales on Wednesday just hours before Trump’s planned 25% tariffs on vehicle imports will go into effect. The tariff will be extended to impact imported auto parts no later than May 3. That will affect just about every major automaker selling cars in the U.S., including Tesla, and may negatively impact sales. Musk has said the cost impact of the tariffs will not be “trivial” and that Tesla won’t be left unscathed. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on a January earnings call that the tariffs will hit the company’s business and profitability. In a recent letter to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Tesla said that even with “aggressive” localization of the supply chain, some parts are “difficult or impossible” to source domestically. Between 60% and 75% of the parts used in Tesla’s electric vehicles are made in the U.S., although that varies by model. “[I]t is becoming crystal clear this tariff/U.S. policy will cause pure chaos to the global auto industry and will raise the prices of a typical car to a US consumer by $5k to $10k out of the gates,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a Monday note. “The winner in our view from this tariff is no one....as even Tesla still is clearly hit from these tariffs and will be forced to raise prices,” Ives, a major Tesla bull, added.

Title: Magnificent 7 stocks slide amid Trump tariff worries

The market’s highest-performing tech stocks, the Magnificent 7, mostly slid on Monday amid worries over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Tesla (TSLA-8.68%) was down 4.8% at 11:30 a.m., while Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%) was off 4.1%, Amazon (AMZN-0.99%) was 3% lower, Meta (META-3.35%) fell 2.1% Microsoft (MSFT-2.15%) dropped 2.5%, and Alphabet (GOOGL-1.04%) was down by 1.1%. Apple (AAPL-5.92%) stock was the outlier among the Mag 7, rising 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 indexes fell 1.5% and 0.5%, respectively, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed earlier losses to rise about 88 points, or 0.2%. The Trump administration is expected to announce new tariffs on Wednesday that could include his so-called reciprocal tariff plan. The White House is currently debating over implementing individualized tariffs on trading partners, or an across-the-board tariff impacting all U.S. trade, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA-5.04%) reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. The president reportedly wants more aggression on tariffs, and has asked his team for plans to impose higher rates of tariffs on more countries, according to the Wall Street Journal. One plan reportedly involves tariffs of up to 20% on mostly all of the country’s trading partners. Trump has also reportedly pushed for import taxes on goods from countries that the U.S. has a trade deficit with. The Trump administration may also introduce industry-specific tariffs, including those that would impact critical minerals and related products, on Wednesday, but that’s not yet certain. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS-6.87%) economists bumped their forecast of the odds of a recession over the next 12 months to 35% from 20%. The increase “reflects our lower growth baseline, the sharp recent deterioration in household and business confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of their policies,” the economists wrote in a note.

Title: Bitcoin nears overbought zone – Why the risk of more losses remains high

Bitcoin faces uncertain market conditions, approaching oversold levels and volatility, with potential opportunities for long-term investors. The “Liberation Day” that U.S. President Donald Trump has discussed is approaching. Heading into the week, U.S. tech stocks saw losses in the overnight trading, with Tesla [TSLA] and Nvidia [NVDA] posting 5% and 3% losses, respectively. The Kobeissi Letter noted that the economic policy uncertainty reached the highest it has since 2020, with the 2nd of April being the date to watch. Moreover, the U.S. jobs report will arrive on the 4th of April, which could also influence market sentiment outside of the tariff news. Gold ETFs saw massive capital inflows, likely a direct consequence of the growing economic uncertainty. This has also put Bitcoin [BTC] and the rest of the crypto sphere on the back foot, as they are risk-on assets. AMBCrypto delved into on-chain metrics to understand if BTC can stabilize around the March lows at $78k or if investors should expect more losses. Source: Checkonchain The short-term holder MVRV Bollinger Bands chart showed that the oscillator was in oversold conditions in late February and early March. Also, the price of Bitcoin was below the cost-basis of short-term holders. This is calculated using the realized price of coins moved within the last 155 days. The price of BTC had been “heated up” in November and December but has cooled off significantly since then. Bitcoin was likely to move below the oversold level, which stood at $78.95k at press time. Source: Checkonchain The Mayer multiple serves as a key metric for determining whether Bitcoin is fairly priced, overvalued, or undervalued based on historical trends. Analysts calculate it by dividing Bitcoin’s market price by its 200-day Moving Average (MA). At press time, the Mayer multiple stood at 0.96. Two weeks ago, BTC fell below its 200DMA and has traded just below this level for most of this time. It stood at $85.92k at press time. The last time the price fell below the 200 DMA was August 2024. The price stayed below this MA for almost two months back then. A similar scenario could unfold now. Investors looking to buy BTC cheap should keep an eye on the 0.8 Mayer multiple, which represented the $68.74k level. Bitcoin would be considered “cheap” around this price level. In conclusion, long-term investors need to hunker down and weather the economic storm of the coming weeks and months. Once the sentiment across the market begins to shift, the trend might shift bullishly. Until then, they can Dollar Cost Average (DCA) into BTC or wait for nasty price drops from giant liquidation events to grab more BTC.

Title: Elon Musk says his DOGE gig has cost him and Tesla 'a lot'

Elon Musk acknowledged that his role overseeing President Donald Trump’s efforts to slash federal spending is costing him — and Tesla (TSLA-8.68%) — “a lot.” Backlash over Musk’s job leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was swift and has grown in recent weeks as the group continues to direct the Trump administration’s approach to downsizing the government. Musk claimed last week that DOGE cuts an average of $4 billion in federal spending each day. His Tesla has become an easy target for protesters angered by his support of Trump and his work in the federal government. Non-violent, anti-Tesla protests have been held across the U.S. and other countries, while vandalism against the company’s customers and facilities has ramped up. Forty-seven percent of voters surveyed by NBC News (CMCSA-5.47%) earlier this month had a negative view of DOGE, while 51% had a negative view of Musk himself. The idea of DOGE, however, was more popular, with 46% calling it a good idea and 40% saying it was bad. “What they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to you know, I don’t know, stop doing this,” Musk said on Sunday. “My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it’s a big deal.” Telsa shares hit a record price of $479.86 at its post-election fueled peak on Dec. 17, but most of those gains have since been wiped out. The stock has fallen by more than 30% year-to-date, sending Musk’s net worth down $102 billion to $330 billion. He still has a more than $100 billion lead over the next richest person in the world, Amazon (AMZN-0.99%) founder Jeff Bezos. Tesla stock dropped by more than 5% to $248 per share in pre-market trading on Monday as investors await weaker first-quarter sales than previously expected. Deliveries are expected to have taken a hit from the “Tesla Takedown” protests that have continued to put pressure on Tesla, as well as weaker sales in Europe and China. “Long term I think Tesla stock’s going to do fine, so maybe it’s a buying opportunity,” Musk said from a political event in Wisconsin, where he took the stage wearing a cheesehead hat. The Tesla CEO was in Wisconsin on Sunday to support Brad Schimel, who has been endorsed by Republicans in the state’s Supreme Court election scheduled for Tuesday. Musk and his allies have spent more than $20 million campaigning across the state. On Sunday, Musk handed out $1 million checks to two local voters who had expressed support for Schimel and signed a petition supporting his candidacy. A third individual had earlier received a $1 million check. Those people were also named as spokespeople for his America PAC, a tactic that allows the group to side-step accusations of running an illegal lottery. A similar strategy was employed by Musk to hand out $1 million checks to more than a dozen people during the 2024 presidential election. “Easiest money you ever made!” Musk said on Monday, advocating for people to get Wisconsin residents to sign America PAC’s petition and post a photo supporting Schimel. “Every time you do that you get $20 and they get $20. The goal is to build awareness about the election tomorrow, so this offer applies to today and tomorrow.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Laughter. Oh, how we need laughter these days. The weight of the world is almost too much to bear. The news. The stock market. The price of (fucking) eggs. The fact that the third season of The White Lotus is almost over. Not that anyone asked, but I think April Fools’ Day 2025 is just what we need. (That and a time machine.) Though I was a sweet but serious kid, I always loved April Fools’ Day. Like Pajama Day at school, or my dad’s green pancakes on St. Patrick’s Day, any departure from the quotidian routine gave me a thrill. And that’s never changed. The origins of April Fools’ Day are murky. Some think it arose in the Middle Ages, when the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar shifted New Year’s Day from spring to January 1. Not everyone observes the holiday on April 1, but countries from France and Brazil to Iran and India dedicate at least one calendar day to jokes and pranks. (In Spain, they have an annual food fight.) There’s something heartwarming about a global norm, agreed to across cultures, that celebrates playfulness and laughter. We are so often divided, but laughter can bring us together. But why do I love this day so much? To find out, I did what every good (faux) investigative journalist does: I asked my therapist. Dr. H’s first impulse was to go dark. She said it could reflect unconscious rage or the desire for power in a relationship, since the goal of a prank is to put one over on someone—and laugh at them. I didn’t want to think that could be true of me. Do I have hidden rage lurking in my subconscious? Probably? (Shrug.) But also, what woman doesn’t? The rage theory didn’t land as a puzzle piece sliding into place. Fortunately, as I gave her some of my examples, she laughed and revised her opinion. For me, she said, it might be about connection. I love to laugh, and thinking deeply about how to laugh at somebody and with them is a way of showing I care. The Clinton impeachment sent the little prankster in me into hibernation (a global scandal will do that to ya). But a few years later, I reclaimed my playful side with the help of a friend and neighbor in NYC, Ann. Now Ann pranked people all year long…and she was good. But April Fools’ Day was her Super Bowl. From her I learned the two keys to success: Always start with a kernel of truth, and always go all in on the joke. My inability to keep a straight face was an obstacle, but technology eventually fixed that. Pranking over text became my specialty. So in a feeble attempt to bring some joy to you today, here are Monica Lewinsky’s Greatest April Fools’ Day Hits: The morning of April 1, I sent a group text to my mom, dad, stepmom, brother, and sister-in-law, saying: Morning. There will be an announcement that comes out today. I have my reasons which I’ll explain later, but so you’re not shocked, I decided to do ‘Dancing With the Stars’ Love you. Silence. Then more silence. A few minutes later, I got a call from my mom. My brother had called her worried and apoplectic. “What is she DOING?! She just gave a TED Talk!” (There might have been some expletives in there.) An hour after that, I got a text from my stepmom: “Please call your dad. He has not figured out this is a joke and is worried because with your bad ankles you’re not a great dancer. He’s called me three times.” To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with doing DWTS. It’s just not the obvious next step in taking back your narrative after giving a TED Talk! However you choose to celebrate this April Fools’ Day, I hope you make it a good one and laugh your ass off. Oh, and by the way, since I have this platform here, I was given permission to announce in the pages of Vanity Fair that I’m joining season four of The White Lotus. Location: the White House.

Title: Could The Economy Push American Express Stock Down 50%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/31/could-the-economy-push-american-express-stock-down-50/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AXP Stock Question: How would you react if you held American Express stock (NYSE: AXP) and its value dropped by 50% or more in the near future? While this might seem dramatic, it's not unprecedented and could occur again. American Express shares have underperformed so far this year, falling 7% since early January, compared to a 3% decline for the S&P 500 over the same period. Despite a stronger-than-expected Q4 2024 performance—driven by increased payment volumes and higher fee-related income—several challenges may lie ahead. Negative sentiment in the market has risen due to fears of a U.S. recession, spurred by tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump on key trade partners. This poses a risk to American Express, given its reliance on consumer spending and international travel trends. Here’s the point: The key message is that in a downturn, American Express stock could suffer significant losses. In 2020, AXP stock lost nearly 50% of its value in just a few quarters and declined about 32% during the 2022 inflation crisis—slightly worse than the S&P 500. This raises the concern: could AXP fall to $135 from the current $270 if similar conditions arise? Naturally, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios. So, if you're aiming for growth with lower volatility, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outpaced the S&P 500 with a total return of over 91% since inception. President Donald Trump’s strict tariff policies—including a 20% tariff on Chinese goods and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as tighter immigration rules—have sparked fears that inflation might return. This suggests the U.S. economy could face major challenges, including a possible recession—see our analysis here on the macro picture. In an interview earlier this month, the President even acknowledged that new tariffs could lead to a recession. Considering the increased uncertainty brought on by these policies, the risks become particularly concerning. In addition, the Ukraine–Russia war and ongoing trade disputes worldwide further cloud the economic horizon. Higher import costs caused by tariffs typically lead to increased prices, which reduce disposable income and dampen consumer spending. This could negatively affect American Express in multiple ways. Rising prices may prompt consumers to reduce discretionary spending, which would hurt transaction volumes on the company’s network. If a recession follows, job losses and declining incomes could reduce spending and payment activity further. Businesses, facing higher expenses, may cut their budgets—resulting in lower corporate expenditures and fewer business-related transactions. American Express has a larger exposure to the travel and entertainment segments than its competitors, and these categories tend to see steeper declines during economic slowdowns. Much of the company’s recent growth has stemmed from increased spending by millennials and Gen Z in these areas. During the holiday quarter, travel and entertainment billings grew by 11%, outpacing the 8% increase seen in goods and services. AXP stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about the impact of a market crash on AXP? Visit our dashboard How Low Can American Express Stock Go In A Market Crash? for an in-depth look at how the stock has behaved in past market crashes. • AXP stock declined 32.0% from a peak of $198.38 on February 16, 2022, to $134.91 on October 2, 2022, compared to a 25.4% drop in the S&P 500 • The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis high by January 26, 2024 • It then climbed to $325.87 on January 23, 2025, and now trades around $270 • AXP stock dropped 49.6% from $136.93 on February 19, 2020, to $68.96 on March 23, 2020, versus a 33.9% fall for the S&P 500 • It recovered fully to its pre-pandemic high by February 23, 2021 • AXP stock plunged 83.8% from $63.23 on October 14, 2007, to $10.26 on March 8, 2009, compared to a 56.8% decline in the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis level by March 5, 2013 At a current price of approximately $270 per share, AXP trades at about 18x expected 2025 earnings—a valuation that appears reasonable. Though the company is seeing steady revenue growth, it’s not spectacular. Analysts expect roughly 8% annual revenue growth for both FY’25 and FY’26. The company's wealthier clientele may provide some cushion during economic slumps, but its strong reliance on discretionary sectors such as travel and entertainment exposes it to risk during downturns. Moreover, American Express has ramped up its marketing spend—jumping 16% in 2024 to roughly $6 billion—which could pressure margins further if the economy weakens. Given the uncertain growth outlook and broader economic risks, ask yourself: Would you continue to hold AXP stock, or would you sell if it starts dropping toward $135 or below?
