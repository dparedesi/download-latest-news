Title: Plaid Raises $575 Million In Funding At $6.1 Billion Valuation

ByJeff Kauflin ByJeff Kauflin, Forbes Staff. Plaid CEO Zach Perret is raising money to cover an upcoming tax bill and to let employees sell some of their Plaid stock. San Francisco-based Plaid, whose main business is helping fintechs and other companies connect to consumers’ bank accounts, is raising $575 million in a deal that values it at $6.1 billion, down more than 50% from the $13.4 billion it reached in 2021. The investment is being led by large asset management firms including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity Management and Research and BlackRock, with venture capital firms NEA and Ribbit also investing. A spokesperson for the 12-year-old company says most of the proceeds will be used to cover tax liabilities that will come due over the next few years, when employees’ restricted stock units (RSUs)—a form of equity compensation where a business promises to grant you stock at a future date–vest and convert into common stock. Plaid will use a “small portion” of the $575 million fundraise to buy back stock from employees in a tender offer, letting them cash out a small part of their Plaid stock, according to a spokesperson. After Plaid pays for its coming tax liability and the employee tender offer, it will use whatever is left of the $575 million to help fund its business, though it expects that to be “a minimal amount.” Have a story tip? Contact Jeff Kauflin at jkauflin@forbes.com or on Signal at jeff.273. Stripe took a similar step in March 2023 with a $6.5 billion tender offer that allowed employees to sell their private shares in the company, and it has done at least two more tender offers since then. In recent years, Plaid has expanded beyond its core bank-account-linking features into three new lines of business: credit-risk analytics, fraud prevention and pay-by-bank. That has helped reverse the growth slowdown the company saw in 2023, when it expanded just 12%. In 2024, its revenue rose 25% and exceeded $300 million, and its gross profit margin was roughly 80%, according to a person familiar with its business. The company still wasn’t profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. The fintech market has improved notably since it began on a downward trajectory in 2022. In the first quarter of 2025, fintechs raised roughly $10.3 billion in funding globally, according to CB Insights, the highest quarterly total since the first quarter of 2023. Digital bank Chime and buy-now, pay-later giant Klarna are planning to go public over the next few months, but Plaid is unlikely to try to IPO this year. “Our hope is that we will get there in the next couple years, but no plans for a 2025 IPO,” Plaid CEO Zach Perret told Bloomberg in January. Last month, The Information reported that Plaid was planning a fundraise at a valuation of roughly $6 billion.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Plaid, which connects bank accounts to financial applications, has sold about $575 million worth of common stock at a $6.1 billion post-money valuation, the fintech company confirmed to TechCrunch. The valuation is about less than half of the $13.4 billion that San Francisco-based Plaid was valued at when it raised a $425 million Series D in April 2021 in a round led by Altimeter Capital. A spokesperson acknowledged the decrease, saying it was “simply a reflection of the contraction of multiples across the market.” Indeed, higher interest rates have led to lower valuations for many startups that last raised at the top of the high cycle in 2021. Still, Plaid’s new valuation is about 15% higher than the $5.3 billion Visa was going to pay for the company before that acquisition deal fell apart in January of 2021 due to regulatory concerns. Plaid will not go public in 2025 but it is a milestone the company continues “to track towards,” according to the spokesperson. In October 2023, Plaid named former Expedia exec Eric Hart to serve as its new chief financial officer. The fact that it appeared to be eyeing an IPO — albeit with no timeline — drew attention. Today, the company maintains that it is “well-capitailized.” “Plaid’s business is in a great position and we’re optimistic about the opportunity ahead,” the spokesperson said. Franklin Templeton led the “oversubscribed” raise, which also included participation from new backers Fidelity Management and Research, BlackRock, and others in addition to existing investors NEA and Ribbit Capital. Plaid characterized the transaction as “not a Series E,” but rather a sale of common stock, which involves a company directly issuing new shares to raise capital. This is different from a secondary share sale, which occurs when existing shareholders sell their shares to other investors, without the company receiving any new capital. The proceeds of the round will be used to address employee tax withholding obligations related to the conversion of expiring RSUs (restricted stock units) to shares, and to offer some liquidity to its current team via an employee tender offer, CEO and co-founder Zach Perret (pictured above) said in a blog post. While the company did not break down how much capital exactly was going toward each initiative, a spokesperson told TechCrunch the majority of the secondary sale was going toward the conversion of the RSUs that will be expiring in the coming years. “We raised the capital to cover the RSU expiry issue and there is a small tender for employees, but it is not the entirety of the round,” the spokesperson said. Restricted stock units are typically issued to employees through a vesting schedule after they achieve required performance milestones or upon remaining with their employer for a particular length of time. This raise comes on the heels of what Perret described as a “record-setting year on revenue, a return to positive operating margins, and a meaningful increase in the companies and markets” Plaid serves. He didn’t provide hard revenue figures, saying that revenue grew over 25% in 2024 and that the company was approaching “sustained profitability.” In a shareholder letter viewed by TechCrunch, Perret also wrote that new products represented more than 20% of Plaid’s ARR in 2024, “compounding at 93% annually.” Founded in 2012, Plaid got its start as a company that connects consumer bank accounts to financial applications but has since been gradually expanding its offerings to also include lending, identity verification, credit reporting, anti-fraud, and payments. Being a multi-product company has led to traction beyond the traditional fintech customers it started out serving. President Jen Taylor told TechCrunch last June that enterprise and traditional financial institution growth was “starting to outpace the rest of its business.” Overall, Plaid saw “a big upswing in the number of enterprises” it serves in 2024, Perret wrote in the shareholder letter. The company counts Citi, Robinhood, H&R Block, Invitation Homes, GoFundMe, Zillow, and Rocket as “key customers.” Perret also wrote: “Our goal is to build software that makes the financial system easier and better for everyone. Our products are the bedrock upon which many of the most well-known financial brands are built – companies like Affirm, Chime, Robinhood, and SoFi.” Plaid has raised about $1.3 billion in funding over its lifetime. Presently, it has 1,200 employees across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the EU.

I would slowly buy Qqq Nvidia I have these but my average price is a bit higher I have to sell other stocks to buy more qqq and nvidia Also look at SOFI in the 11$ range If long term investor, it’s always a good day to buy, lf short term investor, its always a good day to sell. FWIW, this drop in the futures is based on very low volume. I dont think the prices are representative of the larger market. Buyers and sellers are on hold. How long to you expect the slide to last? When does reciprocal become the norm? All the smart traders sell on the dips and buy at the top. I’m taking profit on my reverse ETF positions (SPXS/SQQQ) and adding to my treasuries (TLT/BIL) and looking for a high dividend REIT that deals with factories. Still keeping some cash on the side as I don’t think the bottom will be in until we hit 15% down from the high at a minimum. That would put the Dow at 38270, S&P at about 5200-5250, NASDAQ around 17750 (20% vs 15% because it’s more volatile). Your mileage may vary. “Buy low. Sell high.” I have no idea how long the decline, my financial plan is okay if 40% down for 10 years before needing to resign in spending. That’s some president y’all got there. That is my strategery. It has been a faithful plan of investing. I’ve been in the market for thirty years. It’s impossible to predict (time) what the market will do. By the time you see the information in the media the market players have already priced in the moves. We, the great unwashed, are too far down the information train to do anything effective. Having said that, we’re in a war with another one threatening. You could hardly do badly buying the military industrial complex. But Amazon and Visa have outperformed most of them. With only one exception I own only American companies because we have the most “honest” bookkeeping. Buy and only sell when you notice a long slow decline. That means the people running the company have taken their eye off the ball. Go to Yahoo finance and call up the long-term stock price chart. They generally trend into the same direction until they either double or crash and burn. Buy and sell accordingly. For the longer period mentioned, dollar cost averaging in the S&P500 on the way down is the way to go. No one ever knows the bottom. I’ve done that for a long time, and it has been great. ETF’s are more tax efficient than mutual funds. Picking individual stocks is just too darn difficult. You, and people who sound you, are real bright lights. I guess America needs to keep taking it in the keister forever, before someone is brave enough to do something about it? We are broke as a Nation! The world’s gravy train @ Americas expense is over, and I LOVE IT ! If I feel some short term pain, for longer American gain, so be it! Grow a spine! I will suggest investing in America. By purchasing an indexed mutual fund you are purchasing shares of a cross section of America. In the long run, betting on America is a certain winner. If you must buy only one, Tesla is still cheap even though it has risen very recently. Thus endeth the investment advice. Sepius nefas , nunquam in nuto 😂 A much needed correction. As Maria Bartiromo said.....if the market drops, she’ll buy with both hands. (paraphrasing) Where their tariffs that Trump is responding to “punishing”?

Title: The Biggest Billionaire Gainers 2025

ByRoy Canivel ByRoy Canivel, Forbes Staff. The past 12 months have been very good to the planet’s billionaires. There are more of them (3,028) than ever before and they’re richer than they’ve ever been (worth a combined $16.1 trillion). Overall, the billionaire class is nearly $2 trillion richer than last year. But the big gains have not been shared evenly: $453 billion of the increase comes just from ten super fortunate people. These ten biggest gainers on Forbes’ 2025 World’s Billionaires list each added tens of billions—or, in one case, more than $100 billion—to their already-massive fortunes since the 2024 ranking. They made their money in retail, finance and, mainly, tech. No one in the world gained more than Elon Musk, who took back the title of richest person in the world after a stellar year for his startups SpaceX and xAI, plus a 12-month rise in the share price of Tesla, despite a recent selloff. Musk is an astonishing $147 billion richer this year. He’s the only billionaire to add nine figures to his net worth since the 2024 list. Eight of the ten are American citizens, either through birth or, in the case of Musk, naturalization. The other two are Lei Jun, a Chinese citizen whose fortune grew by 300%, to an estimated $43.5 billion, thanks to higher demand for his company’s electric cars, and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, a Canadian citizen worth an estimated $62.9 billion amid a jump in crypto markets. Tim Pannell for Forbes The only daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992), she became the world’s richest woman in September, her first time since 2022. She hit the $100 billion mark in November as Walmart shares climbed to record highs. The stock is up more than 53% since last year. Best known for spearheading the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in her family’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, Walton has given away an estimated $1.7 billion, including her most recent gift, disclosed in an August filing, of $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, also in Bentonville. Changpeng Zhao, who goes by CZ, is the founder and former CEO of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. In November 2023, Zhao stepped down as Binance's CEO as part of a sweeping settlement with U.S. authorities. He pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and was sentenced to four months in prison. He also paid a $50 million fine. He’s richer this year amid bull crypto markets and a Forbes investigation into his vast holdings of Binance’s exchange-issued token, BNB. Despite demands from the Justice Department to break up Google, the Alphabet cofounder and board member is $30 billion richer thanks to a 30% rise in the Google parent company’s shares. Page, who stepped down as Alphabet CEO in 2019, is reportedly working on a new company that plans to apply AI to manufacturing. The youngest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992), he retired from Walmart’s board in 2016 and yielded the seat to his son Steuart. He remains the chairman of the family's Arvest Bank Group, which boasts assets of $26 billion. The cofounder of Susquehanna International Group, one of Wall Street's largest and most successful trading firms, has invested in hundreds of private companies globally, including TikTok parent ByteDance, its most valuable holding based on Forbes reporting. He’s benefitted as ByteDance’s valuation has hit $312 billion in private markets amid a bidding war over TikTok. In September, he became the first member of America’s richest family to join the $100 billion club, on the back of rising Walmart shares. The eldest son of Sam Walton (d. 1992), he retired from the board in June 2024, after more than four decades as a director. Visual China Group via Getty Images From budget-friendly smartphones to electric vehicles, Xiaomi has come a long way since Lei Jun cofounded the Hong Kong-listed company in 2010. With the firm’s electric vehicle venture seeing higher demand for its cars, shares have climbed more than 300%. Last year, Lei was worth an estimated $10.9 billion. He is also the chairman of Hong Kong-listed software firm Kingsoft and an investor in JOYY Inc., a Nasdaq-listed live-streaming and social media platform formerly known as YY.com. Not long ago, Mark Zuckerberg banned President Donald Trump from Facebook and Instagram following the January 6 riots. One presidential election later, the Meta founder has friended Trump, including putting pro-Trump entrepreneur Dana White on Meta’s board in early January and cohosting an inauguration reception for the president alongside several Republican billionaires. Shares of his social media giant have surged nearly 25% since last year’s list, making Zuck the second richest person in the world for the first time. Ellison, too, has been sticking close to Trump. He may not have been front and center among tech tycoons during the president’s inauguration, but he stood a few feet away from Trump when the president soon announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative backed, in part, by Ellison’s software firm Oracle. Ellison’s net worth went up by $51 billion this year thanks to a growing AI business that helped push Oracle’s stock price up by 40%. AFP via Getty Images Thanks to an incredible $147 billion year, Elon Musk, yet again, is the richest person alive. All of his largest assets have gone up in value: Tesla stock is up 50% since last year’s list, rocket maker SpaceX is worth $350 billion, nearly double its valuation from last year, and Musk’s artificial intelligence business, xAI, raised $6 billion from private investors at a $50 billion valuation in November—then, last week, Musk announced that xAI was acquiring X (formerly Twitter) in an all-stock deal that valued X at more than what Musk paid in 2022, and boosted xAI’s valuation to an apparent $80 billion–a $30 billion bump from just three months ago.

U.S. futures indexes fell sharply early on Thursday, led by a deep slide in major tech stocks, while global markets also faced a major selloff after President Donald Trump’s sweeping reciprocal tariffs raised fears of a global trade war and recession. Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) ... More after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC. The benchmark S&P Futures were down around 3.1% to 5,534.25 points in premarket trading early on Thursday, while contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.51% to 41,424 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index was the worst hit, falling 3.45% to 19,079.75 in the premarket, led by slumps in the share prices of major tech companies. Shares of Apple were down more than 7.3% to $207.50 early trading on Monday. Amazon’s stock dropped to $185.01 in premarket, down more than 5.5% from Wednesday’s closing price. Despite semiconductors being exempted from Trump’s reciprocal tariff measures, shares of chipmaker Nvidia fell 4.26% to $105.72 in early trading.

The premarket slump in Apple’s stock comes as the company’s supply hubs appear to have taken the brunt of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. In recent years, Apple has tried to diversify its supply chain and reduce dependence on China by setting up manufacturing hubs for its iPhones and other devices in Vietnam and India. On Wednesday, Trump announced levies of 34% for all imports from China—where a majority of Apple’s iPhones are assembled. This 34% is on top of the previously announced 20% tariffs—bringing the total to 54%. Imports from Vietnam will also face a steep 46% tariff rate, products made in India will face a 26% levy. ‘No Winner In A Trade War’: China, EU And Others React To Trump’s Reciprocal Tariffs (Forbes) Trump Announces Reciprocal Tariff Rates—54% For China, 20% On EU (Live Updates) (Forbes) Trump Imposes Tariffs On Uninhabited Heard And McDonald Islands—‘Remotest Places On Earth’ (Forbes) Here’s The Full List Of Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs Announced Wednesday (Forbes) One Community.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AVGO Stock Following President Trump’s announcement of extensive tariffs on over 100 countries, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock fell by over 6% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The announced tariffs include a significant 34% levy on imports from China, a major global manufacturing hub. While semiconductor goods are reportedly exempt from these specific tariffs, the broader macroeconomic consequences are a concern. The imposition of tariffs on Chinese products is expected to increase costs within the economy, potentially leading to slower economic growth or even a recession. This economic downturn could, in turn, reduce overall investment in areas like Artificial Intelligence, which could negatively impact Broadcom’s sales and future performance. Separately, see Will Apple Stock Fall To $150 On Tariff Troubles? Notably, AVGO stock looks attractive, given its solid financial performance lately, but it trades at lofty valuations making it a tricky pick at its current price of around $170. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AVGO stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Broadcom along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Broadcom’s Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Broadcom’s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. AVGO stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Broadcom’s strong performance suggests that its stock might be an attractive investment. However, this positive outlook is tempered by the stock’s high valuation. Currently, AVGO is trading at 13 times its trailing revenues and 140 times its trailing earnings. This is notably higher than its average valuation over the past four years, which stood at 14 times sales and 71 times earnings. Consequently, despite its robust performance, the stock appears expensive based on these metrics, leading to the conclusion that AVGO is a potentially tricky stock to buy at its current price. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Boomers face a 'devastating' blow to their life savings as more tariff pain looms, finance guru warns

Many people could be left disappointed when they open their IRA statements in the coming days — and President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs threaten to make things even worse. The S&P 500 fell 5% in the first three months of 2025, marking its worst quarter since 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 10% as stocks like Tesla plunged 36%. Those declines have taken a bite out of many people's investments in the stock market, and could disrupt their retirement plans if they continue. "For the small investor, the decline in value will be devastating, particularly for retired baby boomers" who draw their incomes from their retirement accounts, Peter Ricchiuti, a senior professor of finance at Tulane University's Freeman School of Business, told Business Insider. The sell-off is partly in reaction to Trump's topsy-turvy tariffs in recent weeks, which have made it "impossible" for business owners to make decisions, Ricchiuti said. The former investment manager, who once oversaw Louisiana's $3 billion portfolio as the assistant state treasurer, said that running a company has become a "game of Whack-A-Mole" because everyone is trying to guess which industry will be hit next. Trump unveiled tariffs of at least 10% on imports from virtually all foreign countries on Wednesday, with higher rates for nations with a large trade deficit with the US. Goods from China, the number-two exporter to the US after Mexico, will be subject to a 54% tariff from April 9 if nothing changes. The news sent the S&P down almost 5% on Thursday, as key constituents Tesla and Nvidia tumbled by about 6% and 8% respectively. Tariffs push up costs for companies and prices for consumers, while uncertainty discourages hiring, expansion, and spending. Those forces slow corporate earnings growth, eroding valuations and sending stocks lower, Ricchiuti said. Strategists at Goldman Sachs cut their S&P 500 forecast last week, citing the incoming tariffs as their main rationale. They predicted the index would decline a further 5% this quarter and gain 6% over the next 12 months, down from 0% and 16%, respectively. One pressing concern is that Trump ratcheting up import taxes will cause countries around the world to retaliate by imposing reciprocal tariffs on imports from the US. Ricchiuti said that's one reason why tariffs never succeed in leveling terms of trade and instead act as "prosperity killers." During Trump's first term, he imposed sweeping tariffs on goods ranging from steel and aluminum to solar panels and washing machines, and broad-based duties on imports from China. The tariffs led to material price increases and reductions in Americans' real income, studies have found. Another worry for investors and everyday Americans alike is that if tariffs lead consumers to cut back on spending and companies to retrench, overall economic growth could suffer. Ricchiuti flagged there is mounting concern on Wall Street that Trump's trade battles will "cause a recession or even the much-feared stagflation." BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described the national mood in his yearly letter on Monday. "I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader — nearly every person — I talk to: They're more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory," he wrote. Another wave of tariff chaos is now threatening to hit stocks that have already retreated. The timing is terrible for boomers living off their nest eggs, who could see their retirement funds dwindle if they're pulling money out at the same time their stock holdings are falling in value. Ricchiuti bemoaned that the economy was on a good path with falling inflation and record corporate earnings and stock prices ahead of Trump's inauguration. "The worst part of all this is that these economic wounds are self-inflicted," he said. Jump to

Title: AMZN Stock To $120? How Tariffs Could Reshape Amazon's Future

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 25 March 2025, Bavaria, Munich: The logo and lettering of global online mail order company Amazon ... More can be seen under the blue sky on the façade of Amazon Germany's headquarters in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on March 25, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of sweeping tariffs on goods from over 100 countries has sparked concerns about a potential trade war. This could reignite inflation and weigh heavily on the broader U.S. economy and consumer spending. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), in particular, stands to be significantly affected as its online shopping marketplace is heavily dependent on goods sold by third-party merchants in China who supply a significant portion of the goods sold on Amazon. These tariffs could therefore drive up landed costs for a large proportion of Amazon’s inventory. Consequently, a trade war could also reignite inflation and weigh on the broader U.S. economy and consumer spending. Also, see Buy, Sell, Or Hold AVGO Stock At $170 Amid Trump’s Tariffs? Amazon’s stock is not immune to economic downturns and it could face substantial losses. Evidence from 2022 shows that Amazon’s stock value decreased by over 50% within a few quarters. This begs the question: If a downturn similar to the one we saw in 2022 were to materialize, could Amazon’s stock, which was around $240 in February, potentially plummet to below $120? Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio — and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. The concerns raised earlier about the potential impact of tariffs on Amazon are particularly relevant now due to the current economic landscape. While Amazon, like many retailers, has always sourced goods from China and domestic brands with Chinese manufacturing, the present situation presents a larger risk. The recently announced sweeping tariffs, coupled with the increasing possibility of a widespread trade war with key global partners, puts a significant strain on Amazon's global supply chain. This disruption could lead to higher prices for products across its platform, which, in turn, is likely to dampen overall consumer demand. The latest tariff announcement, including a substantial 34% levy on Chinese imports — a major global manufacturing hub — further underscores this risk. As these tariffs on Chinese products take effect, the resulting costs will inevitably be absorbed somewhere in the supply chain. This could mean reduced profit margins for Amazon, or ultimately, higher prices passed on to consumers. Furthermore, Trump's recent aggressive trade policies have reignited fears of a resurgence in inflation, which could further erode consumer spending power and negatively impact retailers like Amazon. All of this means the U.S. economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession — our analysis here on the macro picture. In fact, Goldman Sachs recently revised its forecast, increasing the likelihood of a U.S. recession to 35%, up from its previous estimate of 20%, the Wall Street Journal reported. Given the elevated geopolitical uncertainty, partly fueled by potential policy shifts from the new Trump administration, several critical risks warrant attention. The ongoing war in Ukraine continues to contribute to global instability, and the landscape of international trade remains uncertain. Specifically, the implementation of tariffs can lead to increased import costs, which often translate into higher prices for consumers, reduced disposable income, and ultimately, weaker consumer spending. This presents a significant challenge for companies like Amazon, whose business model is heavily reliant on robust consumer discretionary spending. AMZN stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on AMZN stock? Our dashboard — How Low Can Amazon.com Stock Go In A Market Crash? — has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. Adding to these concerns, Amazon’s stock currently appears relatively expensive, trading at 3.3 times its trailing revenues. This is slightly higher than the stock’s average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.7 times over the past three years. Given this valuation and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the questions: Do you want to hold on to your AMZN stock now? Will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $150, $120, or even lower levels? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy. Trefis works with Empirical Asset Management — a Boston area wealth manager — whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Could the US and China Conclude an Agreement Halting the Momentum Toward Conflict?

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access How Trump’s attack on the global order endangers a deal Beijing might otherwise accept. An unexpected bright spot in the months following Trump’s election victory was his repeated support for some kind of agreement with China. Under Biden, the two most powerful countries in the world had seemed headed for certain conflict, and Trump’s campaign bluster promised even worse tensions. But now Trump was claiming that the two countries “can, together, solve all of the problems of the world,” and China was discreetly sending out feelers about what it could offer to bring off such a deal. Then suddenly, the whole tenor of the relationship abruptly changed. On March 4, China’s Foreign Ministry said: “If the US is determined to fight a tariff war, a trade war—or any other kind of war—China will meet the attack and fight to the finish.” Two days later, the ministry doubled down on the theme, promising that, “no matter if it’s a cold war or a hot war,” the US will not win. The events of March 4 lay bare the reasons that Trump is, at one and the same time, tantalizingly close to his proclaimed goal of world peace and alarmingly close to sending the relationship with China spiraling into conflict. Trump’s antipathy toward the global order, now inspiring an unprecedented attack on the post-Cold War institutions that once sustained American power, is both the reason he can offer such a deal and a source of deep disquiet in Beijing. Deciphering this tension is the key to understanding not just Trump’s China policy but his whole foreign policy agenda. What led to the sudden shift in Chinese rhetoric? Earlier on March 4, alongside 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada that were soon suspended, Trump unceremoniously imposed on China his second across-the-board 10 percent tariff increase in as many months. Like the first one, he justified this one with an absolutist demand—difficult both practically and politically—that China immediately suppress the production of all fentanyl precursor chemicals. Just weeks into his second term, Trump has already quietly levied larger tariffs on China than across the entire world-shaking trade war of his first term—and those first-term tariffs are still in place. Also on March 4, Hong Kong firm C K Hutchison announced that it would sell its overseas ports business—including its two (of five total) Panama Canal ports—to US asset firm BlackRock. While both companies insisted that the sale was a normal commercial transaction, the context of Trump’s repeated condemnation of a “Chinese” presence in the canal was lost on no one. China is now considering how it might prevent the sale from going forward. In his address to Congress that same night, Trump bragged about the ports sale but otherwise barely raised the issue of China. His repeated threats against the territorial integrity of various allies, though, must have raised questions within the sovereignty-obsessed Chinese leadership. Despite these misgivings, Beijing has continued to express its interest in negotiations. After all, Trump’s mercantile sensibility and his disdain for the sacred cows of American geopolitical primacy allow him to take seriously Chinese interests and consider a settlement that could work for both powers. This marks a sharp contrast with Biden’s foreign policy team, who imagined they could avoid conflict with China by conducting rudimentary diplomatic routines even as they steadily exacerbated the pressures toward conflict. The core Biden strategy was to build up US alliances around the principle of excluding China while offering concessions to countries in the Global South if they joined such an exclusionary regime. Convinced of their own righteousness, the administration had difficulty recognizing how such an approach looked from Beijing. Trump, in contrast, recognizes a kindred spirit in Xi Jinping, who shares his own priorities of commercial success and authoritarian control. Unlike Biden’s foreign policy team, Trump does not seek strategic advantage over every space of geopolitical power in the world, so he is less likely to exacerbate Beijing’s fears of encirclement or its anxiety that Taiwan could be permanently separated. Moreover, Trump conceptualizes the economy as a market, where those with bargaining power squeeze profit out of those who lack it, rather than a supply chain, in which power accumulates at strategic nodes associated with scarce goods or technologies. This, too, makes agreement with Beijing more likely, since Trump places less priority than Biden on strangling China’s access to technology or demanding deep changes to China’s political economy. All of this substantiates the hope that the US and China could conclude an agreement capable of breaking the momentum toward conflict. More than Trump’s hunger to see himself as a dealmaker, his whole mode of reasoning establishes the conditions for mutual accommodation between the two powers. Yet both the style and substance of Trump’s leadership also pose a significant threat to that potential. Despite a more pliable set of officials staffing his second than his first administration, the trademark chaos of the first term is just as evident today. That is profoundly unnerving to Beijing, characteristically stuck on protocol and obsessed with stability. Illustrative of the diplomatic pitfalls of such disorganization is that, even after two rounds of punishing tariffs, the administration still can’t explain what it actually wants from China. The shift in Chinese rhetoric in part registers exasperation. However, the most dangerous part of Trump’s foreign policy is not the erratic diplomacy but what seems to be the unifying line running through all the vacillations. Whether threatening to annex neighbors, smashing up the world humanitarian system, shredding the rules of global trade, or actively supporting the nativist opposition across a number of allies, the common thread of all the administration’s early foreign policy moves is open hostility to what remains of the institutions and ideology of neoliberal globalization. Ben Ehrenreich Elie Mystal Chris Lehmann Jeet Heer For four decades, this so-called liberal international order secured America’s position as global hegemon by convincing elites in other countries that they too could gain from free market reform, corporate power, political liberalization, and US suzerainty. But in part because the system failed an increasingly large number of Americans and in part because it constrained the naked exercise of force, the Trump administration now aims to eradicate it. Chinese leaders may be perfectly happy to see hypocritical American paeans to democracy and the rule of law despoiled. The danger is that those same leaders are deeply invested in other core institutions of the system—those parts that secure stability for commerce, promote economic development, and legitimize governing elites. Contrary to the portrayal that dominates DC thinking, in which China is thought to be bent on destroying the rules-based international order so that it can bully weaker countries for gain, China is in fact a cautious and conservative status quo power. It is hostile to those parts of the global system that undermine the political regime’s claims or that represent the unilateral use of force, but the rules of world trade, the prerogatives of state sovereignty, the smooth operation of multilateral institutions to address transnational problems, and the right to development for every country are all basic commitments in state policy. The official line that Chinese foreign policy seeks “win-win cooperation” is based on the (often unreliable) assumption that all these principles are mutually beneficial. Polemical depictions of China come much closer to describing the aims of Trump’s foreign policy than Xi Jinping’s. Ironically, the Trump administration might accept the DC portrayal of Chinese goals as accurate but unobjectionable—surely all great powers would squeeze their neighbors if the artificial constraints of global order were removed. They may believe that they can make Beijing an attractive offer: no longer trying to cut China out of the system and instead simply destroying the system, after which the great powers will be free to work out among themselves how to divide the spoils. If the United States builds an exclusionary sphere of interest in the Western Hemisphere, China could make peace with that because it could prey on countries in its own sphere to make up for lost tribute. We do not know whether anyone in the administration has gone this far in working out the consequences of their current path. But the logic of US actions is great-power predation pushing in the direction of closed imperial blocs. Such an outcome is a nonstarter with China—not just because Beijing would not trust the US to leave it enough space for its own depredations, but because it considers parts of the liberal international order crucial to its own success.

From optimizing the online booking experience to remain competitive with OTAs to valuing the guest’s time at check-in and being smart about upsells, Bashar explains why it’s all about the human connection and meeting your guests’ needs. Bashar also advocates for using technology as a tool to eliminate friction in every stage of the guest journey, so that hoteliers can focus on ultra-personalization that inspires guest loyalty. Tune in and find out if your guests are leaving your hotel without a true connection to your brand, and what you can do to become memorable. As Chief Marketing Officer at Revinate, Karen Stephens is focused on driving long-term growth by building Revinate’s brand equity, product marketing, and customer acquisition strategies. Her deep connections with hospitality industry leaders play a key role in crafting strategic partnerships. Karen is also the host of The Hotel Moment Podcast, where she interviews top players in the hospitality industry. Karen has been with Revinate for over 11 years, leading Revinate’s global GTM teams. Her most recent transition was from Chief Revenue Officer, where she led the team in their highest booking quarter to date in Q4 2023. Karen has more than 25 years of expertise in global hospitality technology and online distribution — including managing global accounts in travel and hospitality organizations such as Travelocity and lastminute.com Bashar Wali – 00:00:00: If I don’t connect with you, you’re just a place. I walk in, I walk out, I get what I need, I move on. Karen Stephens – 00:00:08: Welcome to the Hotel Moment Podcast presented by Revinate, the podcast where we discuss how hotel technology shapes every moment of the hotelier’s experience. Tune in as we explore the cutting edge technology transforming the hospitality industry and hear from experts and visionaries shaping the future of guest experiences. Whether you’re a hotelier or a tech enthusiast, you’re in the right place. Let’s dive in and discover how we can elevate the art of hospitality together. Karen Stephens – 00:00:36: Hello, and welcome to the Hotel Moment Podcast. I am your host, Karen Stephens, the Chief Marketing Officer of Revinate. And today we are thrilled to have Bashar Wali with us, the founder and CEO of Practice Hospitality and This Assembly, which is a group of hospitality service companies that includes Practice Hospitality. With over three decades of experience in the hospitality industry, Bashar has been at the forefront of creating innovative and human-centered hotel experiences. He is passionate about blending creative design, community engagement, and exceptional service to elevate the guest experience. From leading renowned properties like Providence hotels to founding his own companies, Bashar’s approach to hospitality is all about connecting people on a deeper level. So I have to say, if you haven’t had a conversation with Bashar before, you are really in for a treat. He’s got a great lens, as he even self-described, kind of born and raised in hotels and came up in the industry. And his take on where we are as a service industry in terms of how we relate to retail, the airlines, and what we can do better to improve connections with guests and build that trust is really phenomenal. So I think you’re going to laugh. I did a few times. He’s got some great commentary. So here you go, Bashar Wali. Hello, Bashar. Welcome to the podcast. Bashar Wali – 00:01:54: Karen, nice to see you. Delighted to be here with you. So Bashar, Karen Stephens – 00:01:57: You’ve been part of the hospitality industry for decades, and you’ve played a key role in creating unique and immersive hotel experiences. What drives you in the hospitality space, and what excites you most about where the industry is headed? Bashar Wali – 00:02:10: I wish I were that smart to agree with what you said about me. I tell people I’m just a hotel guy trying to do good work, and I really think of our industry as a ultra-simple industry at the end of the day. We’re not curing cancer. There’s no rocket science anywhere here. I feel passion is the singular, most underrated thing people think about when they think about our industry. I can teach you how to do all the things. I could show you how to push the buttons and move things around. I cannot teach you to be passionate about what you do. And unless you really have that fire within, this is not an industry for you. So for me, passion is what drives me, what motivates me, what keeps me going. And looking at human behavior, rather than trends, has been a pillar to everything I do. And what I mean by that is, I think people chase trends, and trends by definition have a shelf life. I say, I look at how humans behave, meaning how they interact with our spaces, how they interact with each other, what their eating trends look like, drinking trends look like, and I try to cater things and craft things to meet their expectations of how they live today. Again, just the way people eat, this idea of food allergies. You can’t exist today without thinking about those. But if you thought about those early enough, you became the go-to. You created loyalty. Because I say, Karen, I have gluten-free. Before gluten-free was a thing. I care about you. I see you. You matter to me. So it’s a nuanced approach that allows you to connect with people and make them feel cared for. That’s really the business we’re in, is making you feel cared for without chasing trends, without shocking on. Now, what I look to for inspiration, sadly, we’ve become a copy-paste industry. I no longer look at hospitality for inspiration. I forever said I’ve always looked at retail for inspiration. And the reason why I think retail specifically is because retail was at the verge of death and necessity is the mother of all invention. So they’ve had to really think about how do we actually change the narrative? How do we keep retail alive? And they’ve managed to understand that retail is not about transaction. Sure, it’s all about transaction, but that’s not how you attract people to you. It’s really about experiences. So you walk into retail stores. Now, everybody has activations and things and bells and whistles. So it’s less about buying the product and more about creating loyalty between you and the brand. So I definitely look at retail. I love their ease of use. I go on Instagram. I see a pair of shoes. I press three buttons. They’re in the mail coming my way. I go on a hotel website to book a room and on step 75, they’re making me change my keyboard from alpha to numerical to give them my zip code. Why in God’s name do you need my zip code? Why does it matter? Right? So it’s funny. We’re very archaic that way. And retail. Retail has leaps and bounds past us. So, yeah, I don’t look at hotels for inspiration anymore. I really look at other industries. Karen Stephens – 00:04:56: That’s really interesting. I love that correlation because I do think in hospitality, we always seem to be a little bit behind the curve and I think you hit it on the head. It’s like, how do you really connect with the guests? And it is about how somebody feels both about your brand and your website and also how they get on property. So can you talk a little bit about the ventures you’re involved in now? So there’s This Assembly and also Practice Hospitality. But how did those two work together to help hoteliers kind of achieve that feeling, for lack of a better word? Bashar Wali – 00:05:24: So we’re trying to organize it better. I know it’s by design been confusing. And frankly, I posted something recently on LinkedIn that I love the fact that many, many people that I know know me and I admire them and they admire me don’t know what I do. And it’s a little philosophical here because I say, look, what I do is not who I am. Who I am is who I am. What I do is secondary. So I love that fact. They sort of say hotel guy. We don’t know if he’s a trust fund kid who loves to loves to stay in hotels or he’s a doorman who works in hotels. And I love that. But to simplify, this assembly was designed to assemble a bunch of amazing people doing amazing things under one umbrella. And that’s what I’m trying to do now. So Practice Hospitality is a hotel management company. I will have the company that does sort of real estate development syndication advisory that will sit under that umbrella. We’re currently thinking about a couple of other ventures that would fit in that category. Ultimately, I want to be your, go-to guy. Hotel guy. Like everybody’s got a guy. I want to be your guy. When someone says, hey, I have this fill in the blank hospitality problem, Karen, I want you to say, I got a guy and kind of fill in the blank. Now, Jack of all trades, master of none, our specialty release sort of lifestyle, how to create places that matter and are memorable. I sort of say from my neurotic jumping around from hotel to hotel, there’s two kinds of hotels in the world. Only two. I don’t care about your Michelin keys and your stars and your diamonds. You’re either memorable. Or you’re forgettable. That’s it. Nothing else matters. I like to say we’re in that memorable hotel space. You can call it lifestyle. You can call it indie. You can go to a boutique. You can label it. However you want to label it. Those are nothing but labels. We’re in the business of when you walk into a place, making you feel a certain way that stays with you and you take it home with you. That’s all I want. And by the way, that could be two star or seven star. It really is not about stars. It’s about what you bring home. Karen Stephens – 00:07:15: Yeah, so I’ve actually heard you say along those lines, it’s that service is what you provide and hospitality is how you make people feel. So that’s kind of a summary of what you just said. Bashar Wali – 00:07:24: 100%. Karen Stephens – 00:07:25: Okay, so how do hotels balance high-tech innovation and with creating that emotional connection? So how do you foster that on property using technology as well? Bashar Wali – 00:07:35: I literally was having this conversation this morning using the airline business as an example. The airlines were masters of eliminating the bodies in the front and pushing you towards the app and the kiosk. They were masters at it. But the one thing they have that we don’t have is once I do all my things on my phone, I book my reservations, I check in, I change my seat, I do all the things. They remove the friction. I no longer need to call or go in a line for an hour to check in at the airport. But what the airlines have that we don’t have is now I’m stuck on that tin can in the air for one, two, 10 hours, and they can engage with me one-on-one. They can provide me service. They can get me to join their tribe by recruiting me, by providing me good service. Not many of them anymore, sadly, particularly in the US, but certainly internationally, they understand that concept. The problem with hotels following that model is, and I’ve used it before, I could literally engage with a hotel the same exact way and never meet a human in the process. Airplane, I’m checking in, I get in my Uber, I walk in the lobby, just zip through the lobby, go on the elevator, open my room, get in my room, get out of my room, leave, check out, never engage with someone. And what a missed opportunity. Because what you’ve done now is you’ve become a commodity. I need a bed and a shower, you give me a bed and a shower. There’s nothing more about it. How do you make a room memorable? A room is not memorable. Marble is not memorable. Art is not memorable. It’s really the people that make those things memorable. It’s not about the art. It’s about the artist who created the art and what was going on in their heart and soul and brain that makes the art more valuable. Even if it’s so abstract, even if it’s paint thrown on a canvas, if you really understand how we came together and engage with that artist indirectly through a curator, through a docent, through something, that’s why the art matters. So I think the danger for us is following the airline model without having that piece where I can connect with you. So my view on technology is we are dinosaurs. We hotels are absolute dinosaurs. Again, back to my example of the booking engine. Hotel people, I love you. I do not want to go to the OTAs to book my room. Please don’t fight me every step of the way when I’m trying to book my room on your website. Make it easy for me. Because by step 75, if you are making me change my keyboard from numerical to alpha, guess what I’m doing? I’m going to Expedia, sorry. One, two, three, room book. We are dinosaurs when it comes to technology. We have a great opportunity to adapt. Be fast at it because we are historically dinosaurs. Remove the friction. My view on technology is its job is to remove the friction. So when I walk up to you at the desk, Karen, don’t ask me to sign here and initial there and stick my credit card here and show you this and do that. The airlines have figured out to remove all of that. Why haven’t we? Allow me at that moment in time when I come up to you at the desk to ask you, what’s your favorite FOSS spot in town? What should I do? What’s around the corner? How do I do this? How do I get that? Like, allow me to engage with you. Because, and I talk about this a lot in Nazi and frankly, everyone who follows me will be like, oh God, here he goes again. I’m going Darwinian on you. You ready? Karen Stephens – 00:10:31: Yeah. Bashar Wali – 00:10:32: We are tribal animals. We need each other to survive. We have not evolved enough past that yet. Maybe someday we will. But right now we all want to feel like we belong. And when you remove the humans out of the transaction, you are shelter. You are providing me the very lowest thing on Maslow’s hierarchy of need that we human needs. We all need shelter. And if you are just shelter to me, man, that is an expensive way to sleep for one night, paying you four, five, eight, nine thousand dollars. If you don’t give me a reason to say, oh, this is my place. I belong here. Sure, I’ll admire your design and your art and your scent and your lighting. All these are important. But ultimately, in my opinion, if I don’t connect with you, you’re just a place. I walk in, I walk out, I get what I need, I move on. So we are not using technology enough to remove friction. We still have a lot of friction points. And by the way, another interesting thing is I tell people, you’re badly mistaken if you think you are in any other business other than retail. You are retailers. Hoteliers, you are retailers. You have perishable inventory. If you don’t sell that room tonight, it is gone forever. You can’t resell it tomorrow. So don’t fight me when I’m trying to buy from you. Allow me to buy seamlessly and then find a hook for me to become loyal to you so I’m not shopping anyone else. Karen Stephens – 00:11:41: Yeah. Can you give an example? So again, if we’re removing the friction and making the booking easier, making the experience and check-in easier, can you share an example of how a hotel experience can foster deeper connection or how humans in the loop can make sure that that happens to create that loyalty and that impact? Bashar Wali – 00:11:58: And again, I feel like I’m sick and tired of hearing myself tell the same stories again. I’ll give you an example I use often. Back to the airline business. Status on Delta, top status. I walk up to the gate. I look on the screen. I see my name at the top of the screen for the upgrade. Sure, I’ll take your upgrade. I’m not complaining. But my brain says, wait a minute. Bashar didn’t get an upgrade. I’m nobody. I don’t matter to them. I’m a record number. Record number 5789 that flew this many miles, that has this much status, that bought the ticket at this time, gets to the top of the upgrade. I’ll take your upgrade. But that doesn’t push that button in me that says, hey, you’re important. You matter. And we all want that. We all desperately want that. We desperately want to matter. Back to Maslow’s hierarchy of need, triangle, bottom is shelter, oxygen, water. The very top is transcendence and self-actualization. And self-actualization to me means, Aaron, you see me. I matter to you, right? That’s what hits that button that I’ve arrived. Now I’m at the peak of my species. So I get on the plane. I got the upgrade. Great, fine. I didn’t get the upgrade. The record got the upgrade. I paid my dues to get that upgrade. You didn’t do it for me. Sitting on that plane, I get a handwritten postcard from the pilot that says, dear Mr. Wali, thank you for being a million miler. Thank you for continuing to fly with us through the pandemic. You’re the reason we fly. I am king of the world. I am blown away. So in hotels to be more tactical and kind of stop being so philosophical and nebulous, if you want to accomplish that same idea, to me, the future of luxury is ultra personalization. Forget what color M&M I want on my pillows. That’s so true. Trivial and inconsequential. I’ll give you an example. I’m top status on Marriott. I’ve stayed in hundreds of Marriotts across the globe. Hundreds. I like my room 64 degrees year round. You would think once someone says, hey, we know this customer is a good customer. 20% of your customers give you 80% of your business. We should know that he likes his room cold. I’m going to push a button because technology allows us to do that. I don’t even need to go to the room anymore. Energy management system to drop the temperature for him and take credit for it. Leave a little note that says, hey, we know you like your room more temperature. You’re all set. Hope you enjoy it. Because that wins my loyalty. Not your damn points. Because points are not loyalty. Points are bribery. Come stay at my hotel. I will give you a point. If I stop giving you points, are you still coming? No, that’s not loyalty. I’m buying your loyalty, not earning it. So I think there are a lot of simple ways. But to me, really, it is about ultra customization. And that could mean, by the way, let’s be clear. The biggest luxury for me, single biggest luxury is time. We just don’t have enough of it. So if you want to give me luxury, don’t waste my time. So that may mean I don’t want to talk to you. I don’t want to engage with you. I want to choose to. Don’t force me to. So when I show up at 11 p.m. to check in for a one night stay, you know, I’m leaving at seven. Why are you telling me about the spa? Does it look like I care about your spa or your gym? So those to me are honestly emotional intelligence at the end of the day is where it boils down to. If we can focus enough on helping our team learn and foster emotional intelligence, read the room, read your customer. I don’t need ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen. I’m not a gentleman. Don’t call me by my last name. Don’t send me a butler. Give me what I need. So I tell people when I interview people. And by the way, I have a bunch of jobs open. We have new hotels opening. I don’t care about your Cornell. I don’t care about your whatever. I care that you have common sense, which is very uncommon and have emotional intelligence. People, we are not curing cancer. This is not that hard. All you have to do is be nice and read the room. That’s it. Kind of like at home. When you have company at home, read the room, Karen. If the music’s too loud, read the room. Turn the music down. Right? Like it’s so simple, yet so hard. Karen Stephens – 00:15:34: I love that. I’m over here laughing. It’s so true. I think the other thing that really hit for me. So first of all, ultra personalization. Yes. And then the second thing is and take credit for it. In other words, you don’t have to be like, you know, but just a little note in the room. Bashar Wali – 00:15:49: Take credit for it. Karen Stephens – 00:15:50: Yeah. It’s a morgue temperature in here on purpose. Bashar Wali – 00:15:53: Absolutely. Take credit for it. The other piece I’ll touch on on technology. Again, look at retail, right? Like I mean, look at Amazon and Instagram and you don’t even have to say it anymore. You think about it and it shows up. Like I feel that if we wanted to, we have the ability to. Karen, I can for very little money tell you how many times you went to the bathroom in your room, how long your shower was, whether you flushed the toilet or not, whether you washed your hands after you’ve used the toilet or not. We can dig so deep in on you to really get to know you. I am shocked. And maybe I’m wrong. And if someone thinks I’m wrong, please correct. That Marriott, the largest, doesn’t have an entire department with a bunch of MIT PhDs that are data scientists that are saying, okay, what can we learn about Karen and how do we put it to work to her benefit? Not big brother, not breaching any privacy issues. I know there’s a lot of people concerned about that. But for example, I have a routine, right? Business traveler. I walk in the room. There are five things I do every time. So if you know that every time I walk in the room, I turn the temperature down and I put the TV on, pick a channel, CNN. Think how magical that would be for me. To arrive in the room, have the temperature be down and the TV be on CNN. Because now I’m loyal to you. You know me, you get me. But nobody thinks about loyalty in that lens. We keep thinking about bribery, throw points at them, extra points. Oh, great. So that’s where the magic is lost. But you make a good point about take credit for it. Because if I don’t know, I won’t know. I’ll assume it’s a coincidence. Maybe, oh, they put the TV on CNN. It happens to be what I watch. Great. But if you say, hey, not to every guest, by the way, you’re a thousand room hotels. You’re not sending a thousand handwritten notes. And by the way, for those who don’t know, you literally can buy a machine, a robotic machine that has a pen, not super expensive, that will write handwritten notes for you. So you can’t write a thousand notes handwritten with a pen. But take credit for it. Because taking credit for it is your way of showing me love and showing me that you care about me. Karen Stephens – 00:17:42: Yeah, that’s amazing. The other thing I want to pick up on is just talking about points, even in the airline or with hotel. It’s like you earn those points because you’re on those planes all the time, in those rooms all the time. So that’s not a reward for me. That’s a road warrior. You know, that’s something in my career that makes me be here all the time. Bashar Wali – 00:18:00: It’s the price of admission, right? Like it is the price of admission. And funny, by the way, you see those who get it, they’ll show up at an independent hotel with no points. They’ll open their wallet and there’ll be every top status card in their wallet that you see. They’re not choosing you for the points. Again, listen, and we’ll talk about the other kind of a traveler in a minute. But those who are seeking the experiences, they’re not choosing you for the points. But if you give them the points, sure, they’ll take it. But they’re not gonna sacrifice the experience for the points. So if you happen to have a good experience and you give them points, okay, great, bonus. But that’s not what they’re coming there for. Now, in fairness, there’s a lot of hardworking people out there who are barely making it, who will go out of their way to a lesser experience to get the points because that’s how they take their family on vacation. I am not knocking those people. But they are doing that consciously and they’re doing thoughtfully for a reason. So no knock on those point chasers because I get why they’re doing it. But if you’re touting your ability to attract people based on experience, my argument is you don’t need points. Karen Stephens – 00:19:00: Well, we talk about this a lot at Revinate. We deal with a lot of independent hotels and small groups. And it is about the experience and tailoring that experience and making sure that people understand even beyond the hotel, what’s in the local area that’s going to enrich your whole stay. So we think about that a lot. Because if you don’t have 30,000 rooms, points really don’t. It takes a long time to do. Bashar Wali – 00:19:22: And we talk a lot about CRM, and I think people throw that word around and they don’t know what it means anymore. CRM isn’t sending a guest an email to have them come back and stay. It’s a complex journey from beginning to end to build customer relationship management. Relationship. We think about it transaction. I have a need period. I’m going to send you an email to come stay with me. That’s not relationship nurturing. Relationship nurturing is having a dialogue with you ongoing in any different way, whatever that means, a newsletter or whatever. It’s not always about look at me, look at me, come by me, come by me. So I think we need to better define CRM in our industry broadly and what it means back to this ultra customization issue. Also, we back to again, Marriott to pick on them for a minute. You should know everything about me, but what are you doing with that information? Nothing. As far as I’m concerned, nothing. And by the way, the same example I gave you about the upgrade on Delta. I mean, I’m a hotel ops guy. I grew up in the business. When you get an amenity in the room, Karen, don’t get excited. I don’t know who you are. You’re just a name on a list. I print a list that says, here are the VIPs. Karen is VIP level one. You send her this amenity. So it’s very impersonal unless it is personal where someone found out something about you, knew you liked, how do you do melon or whatever? I wrote you a note to take credit for it. Hey, this is not just an amenity that everyone gets. Karen, we know you like honeydew and we sent you honeydew specifically because then it’s not an amenity. Then it’s like, holy crap. I love these people. How did they know that about me? Karen Stephens – 00:20:41: Yeah, it really does feel like that too. I admit it. Bashar Wali – 00:20:45: Transactional, all transactional. Karen Stephens – 00:20:47: Right? That’s so true. Okay. You mentioned Instagram. So let’s talk a little bit about the Instagramification of hotels. How do you think this trend is shaping how hotels market themselves and what should hotels be doing to tell their brand story more effectively using digital? Bashar Wali – 00:21:02: As I vomit in my mouth at the very thought of Instagrammable moments. So I often say, do good work. Funny, I tell designers, if you win an award for doing this project for me, I will never hire you again because now the award is the only thing you’re thinking about. So you will do things that make no sense, that have no basis. And in reality, because you’re chasing that nebulous award. What I say is do good work and the award will come. And similarly, do thoughtful things that naturally become Instagrammable moment. Don’t go put a sign on the world, a wall that says, this must be the place you have arrived. La la la la. Like we’ve seen them all now. And when cool becomes ubiquitous, it’s not cool anymore. When there’s a checklist on how to be cool, that is the definition of being uncool. Do not follow that checklist. So this never ending Instagrammable moment, has become almost our purpose and our North Star to a fault. It makes no sense. Sometimes what we do with it as no context, it has no basis. If you are thoughtful about what you do, I love those two words, thoughtful and intentional. Don’t just put a piece of art on the wall because it’s a good piece of art. Make sure it resonates. It has meaning. It has purpose specifically. And the way you could tell your story through digital, which is super important, obviously, and I’ll give you a real life example in a minute is make sure that the work that. You’re doing to tell the story has those moments of surprise and delight. I hate that term too. It’s very hotel nineties. But the idea is like, if you’re trying to tell me a story about this historic building or this location or this market or this destination or these people or whatever it is that you’re celebrating or this forest or this river, find a moment that’s interesting. That’s elegant, intentional, and thoughtful that you believe will naturally become the Instagrammable moment. Don’t start the process by saying, let’s find the Instagrammable moment out of this thing and put it on the wall. We’ve story. And you know, when you’re reading a book and there’s a, maybe an illustration that’s beautiful and it grabs your attention. That’s how I think of it. But that illustration is a part of the story. It’s not just some random thing thrown on a wall that has no context whatsoever to the story. So that’s how I think about Instagrammable moments. They are important. We have to use digital. The example I was gonna give you is I take my kids on separate trips every spring break across the globe, one-on-one and often I’m the neurotic hotel guy. I’m gonna pick the hotel. So last time I went with. My daughter, seven countries in 10 days, literally I said, you’re in charge. You go find the hotels. Here’s your parameters. Here’s the budget. Here’s the quality, et cetera. Don’t tell me. And I promise, cuz I’m known to be whiny a lot about that stuff. I’m like, I will shut my mouth and I will accept it. Literally every hotel she picked in seven countries across the globe that we’ve never been to, except for one I had been to were spectacular. I would have never found them. And she found them all on TikTok. So dear hoteliers. Sure. It’s nice to be in The New York Times. So. I can go to a cocktail party and brag to my friends that my hotel made it in The New York Times. That’s not how people are buying today. If you’re not on digital and all in on digital, you are asleep at the week. You’re the guy who back in the nineties said, oh, that internet thing is a fad. It’ll go away. The future is short videos, real time user generated. It can’t all be shiny influencer, sexy bikini. That kind of like early on when we, the TripAdvisor, right? Like it was so good cuz it was user generated. You could rely and trust it. People are far more sophisticated now and they can read through the BS that we might serve them. So it has to be authentic, but that’s where the future is. And you have to create places in your hotel that are a conducive for these customers that are paying you to help you tell your story for free. They’re doing your marketing for you. Don’t get in their way. Let them walk around with their selfie sticks. Let them have the right, proper lighting. Make sure your wifi is fast enough. That’s how you foster those people to allow them to come brand evangelists for you across the globe. But absolutely the future, a hundred percent across the spectrum from luxury to select serve is digital. Like got email who opens email and reads email anymore. Are you kidding me? But it has to be, it can’t be, oh, let’s do a reel for TikTok tomorrow. No, no, no, no. It has to be a bonafide, well thought out, thoughtful and intentional strategy. That is a long-term strategy. It’s all let’s spend a thousand dollars on TikTok next month. Oh, we got no money out of it. Forget to no, no, no, no. It has to be part of your marketing plan. Karen Stephens – 00:25:20: I love that because I do think that kind of the old way of thinking is what is our social media strategy? We’re going to do X amount of posts per week. We’re going to blah, blah, blah, blah. And what I’m hearing you say is create the environment and the experience. And obviously your hotel has to be great. And then those guests are going to come in and they will do your marketing for you, especially the younger generations, right? I was skiing the other weekend and there was a guy at the top of the mountain, you know, had his whole coat off taking pictures with the lake behind. I mean, it was like, what is going on? But I just realized, hey, that’s a generational thing. And they’re the new buyers. Like I’m reading the The New York Times. They’re looking at TikTok. Bashar Wali – 00:25:59: And they’re influencing their parents, also the younger ones. Like, by the way, Karen, you think you’re the decision maker? You’re not. You’re gonna listen to those kids. They’re gonna influence their decision-making for you. And to your point, let the consumers do the hard work for you, but you still have to have your own strategy. And of course, influencers are very important. And I think influencers, it’s become a dirty word almost, but those that are good at it and know what they’re doing are very accretive and valuable. But we also get caught up in the ROI. And I get it. I’m an owner and an operator in some cases. We all want ROI. But you can’t spend a dollar on Instagram and expect to get $7 back because there’s this idea of brand recognition. Why does AT&T pay 40 million bucks to put their name on a stadium? They’re not saying, how many more phones or plans have we sold as a result of this? They’re saying, we want our name to be front and center. So I think of those campaigns as two separate ones. There’s the name recognition that you can’t put an ROI on because it’s a long-term brand strategy. Then there’s the direct campaign. I have a sneak period. I want to succinctly do a campaign to generate traffic to this hotel during that period. What do I do? And you can’t do it the day before. Like this again, has to be a strategy in place, kind of like sales plans and marketing plans. You created the beginning of the year. 90% of them sit on a shelf and nobody looks at them ever again. It has to be a living documents that changes every day because habits change, platforms change, and timing and need periods change. And I think we’re not using digital enough because sadly, the industry is dominated by middle-aged white dudes and they all want to be in the The New York Times and they all want to be in that whatever. I would much rather be mentioned in Goop than be in the The New York Times. I mean, that’s again, we’ve got to shed the old thinking. I call us the middle-aged white dudes, not white, but the double-breasted shiny suit guys who still think that thing is in style. Although maybe it is coming back now. Like we’ve got to shed the notion that we know everything and really listen and learn because we do not know everything. And if you think you know everything today, literally go home and retire because you’re dead. You’re going to be a has-been and so fast, you won’t know what hit you. You’ll be five minutes ago. We have to pay attention to what’s happening in real time. And things change so fast today. Back in the old days, think about revenue management. Back in the old days, you met once a month, you set the rates for the month and that was it. You’re done with revenue management. Now it’s like a stock market ticker. You have to watch it like a hawk and yield and how you yield those rooms. There’s talk now of Karen, if you want to sit in the restaurant at the table by the window at 7 p.m. on a Saturday, the menu is dynamic. The menu prices will change because the idea is you want premium and that’s where technology can help you maximize your returns, be agile and nimble because how do I do that now? Print different menus for different hours for different tables. But whether it’s a QR code, which by the way, I hate it’s that the QR codes are over, but there are a lot of ways to create dynamic pricing across all things we do to allow us to maximize. And by the way, allow Karen who can’t afford this restaurant at 7 p.m. On a Saturday to come at 5 p.m. On a Monday and get a really good deal. So it’s good for us for maximizing our revenue and it’s good for the consumer because now they could choose what their budget is and what fits in that budget. Karen Stephens – 00:29:10: Right. Wow, that’s fascinating. I think digital strategy, we talk about this a lot, the long game and the short game. And again, that’s kind of borrowed from retail and traditional marketers. But hoteliers need to think of that as well. Brand building is not a short term activity. It does not have ROI out the gate. It’s something that, that goes over time. I’m telling you, my VP of marketing right now is jumping up and down because we talk about this all the time. Bashar Wali – 00:29:32: Well, again, and what I said to you earlier is we don’t think we’re retailers and we really need to change that narrative. We say, oh, we’re in the guest service business. No, no, no. Guest service is what you do to make what you make at the end of the day work. Your job is to sell those rooms day in and day out. That’s the only job you have. Karen Stephens – 00:29:49: Right. Okay, so I have one last question for you. So as a hotel operator, as someone who’s been in the business, has owned a lot of hotels, has had different brands and now with the two companies you’re with now, there’s a lot that hotel operators are dealing with. And what is your piece of advice? I mean, if you just think about the context that we’ve already got staffing shortages, costs are just going up, up, up. So I feel like the struggle for an operator at this point is to figure out how to do all of these things and stay alive. Maybe that’s dramatic, but one piece of advice for operators. Bashar Wali – 00:30:18: I wish I’d give it to myself if I had it. I mean, look, fundamentally, I am a true believer in the hire people that are smarter than you are and get out of their way. And that’s becoming harder and harder to your point about the labor market and now the immigration issue and deportation issue and how that affects our industry, et cetera. It has been a really, really rough go for us. Prices continue to go up. Margins continue to get squeezed. The big get bigger and make it harder for us little guys to kind of go chase it. I hate this idea of us being service providers, view the service provider. Karen, if you own a hotel, me being your service provider is very transactional. You’re hiring me to provide you a service and you’re paying me a fee for it. I think we’ve forgotten the idea that the way for this to be successful for both of us, this is a relationship. This is a partnership. I want to be your partner, your owner. I don’t want to be your service provider because by being your partner, it changes our collective perspective. We’re at the table together. Your concerns are mine. I’m helping you think your concerns. You’re invested in my success because my success is your success. I feel like there’s a lot of tension now between owner and operator. It always seems like it’s a fight. And I think the best example, obviously, is when you are the owner and the operator because now you control everything. But in the example where you are a service provider, our services become commoditized in a way by the big boys that have 1,500 hotels and will do it on a month-to-month basis for nothing, basically. If you want those guys, you can have them. They’re going to be your service provider. My advice to people in my space is you have to be a partner to your owner. You have to understand their hopes, their aspirations. You have to set their expectations realistically from the get-go. Don’t over-promise and under-deliver. And don’t under-promise and over-deliver. Really, it’s kind of like a marriage or any relationship, for that matter. I think any relationship has to be built on the foundation of trust. If you don’t have trust, you have nothing. So we don’t spend enough time really getting to know our customers, our partners, our owners, establishing that trust relationship. But make no mistake about it, a good friend of mine described this management business as a knife fight out there, and it is a knife fight. At the end of the day, care and owner, if you’re a partner, if you want the commodity person, I’m not your person, I will make you connections to lots of people who will do it cheaper, faster. It just depends on what you want, and that might be the answer for you. But if you really want a partner, here, I’ll give you the silly analogy I use. You and your spouse are trying to have kids. It’s hard, hard, hard, hard. Finally, after years and hundreds of thousands of dollars, you have your baby. Blood, sweat, tears, money. Because that’s what hotels are to many developers. They’re not transactional. They’re passion, they’re children. And now you and your spouse want to go out to dinner. So you’re like, well, what do I do with the baby? Do you hire someone to manage your baby? Is that what you do? Manage is such a passive, transactional word. And that’s how we viewed it. So now my example now, you have this hotel, blood, sweat, and tears. You’ve agonized for months over what feeling that doorknob will give you when you open it, how tactile it is. And you’re going to give it to someone to manage? So the words I’d like to use back to the baby context is, you want someone to love, care for, nourish, nurture your baby. If you don’t think about it in those lens, and if I don’t think about it in that lens that you’re handing me your baby that I should love and cherish and grow, it’s transactional. I’m just managing your baby. I mean, think about literally that terminology. So I think, again, we’ve gone away from that whole inner person. Chip Conley was a genius at this with Joie de Vivre. His job wasn’t running hotels. His job was really engaging the owners. The owners didn’t hire J.D. Vitor on their hotels. They hired Chip Conley. Chip Conley knew their kids. He took them out to baseball games. He was a friend. He was their partner. And that’s why those relationships were successful because they were all built on this interpersonal thing and not just transactional. So if there’s any piece of advice I will give you is if you think of yourself as a service provider, I get paid to do the job, then fine, there’s a place for you. But if you really want to do something unique and different is you have to think about this as a partnership, a marriage, a relationship, and nurture it. You can’t just take it for granted. You can’t get the deal, send the show pony in to get the deal and walk away. It’s like any relationship. You have to continue to nurture and water it and feed it and take care of it for it to thrive. Karen Stephens – 00:34:27: I love it. Well, thank you, Bashar. I really appreciate the conversation. Bashar Wali – 00:34:31: Thank you. Delighted to be with you.

Title: VanEck Seeks BNB ETF Approval—Big Win For Binance?

Investment giant VanEck has registered a Binance Coin (BNB) exchange-traded fund in Delaware, marking its fifth cryptocurrency ETF registration in the state. The move comes as major financial institutions continue to bet on digital assets despite market volatility. According to public records on Delaware’s official state website, VanEck registered the new product on Monday under filing number 10148820. The “VanEck BNB ETF” was registered as a trust corporate service company, following similar registrations for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche ETFs. The New York-based company confirmed the BNB ETF will track the price of Binance Coin, currently ranked as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market value of approximately $599. On-chain data showed BNB’s trading volume jumped 40% to over $2 billion after the announcement. VanEck’s filing represents the first attempt to create a Binance Coin ETF specifically for US investors. While other BNB-related products exist in global markets, such as the 21Shares Binance ETP, none are based in the United States. The 21Shares product remains the only exchange-traded note tracking the Binance Coin index. JUST IN: VanEck Registers Entity for Potential First BNB ETF in the U.S. VanEck has filed in Delaware to register an entity, hinting at plans for the first-ever BNB ETF in the U.S. market. The move marks a significant step towards expanding the accessibility of Binance Coin… pic.twitter.com/iFXBVu4mkD — Crypto Town Hall (@Crypto_TownHall) April 2, 2025 The registration follows VanEck’s successful launches of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year after securing Securities and Exchange Commission approval. The company manages nearly $115 billion in client assets globally. “VanEck seems to be taking a ‘throw everything at the wall and see what sticks’ approach, which makes sense,” said Sumit Roy, senior ETF analyst at etf.com. “Avalanche isn’t the most widely traded cryptocurrency, but being first to market with an ETF in a new category comes with potential upside and little downside.” The move comes just weeks after VanEck applied for SEC approval to launch the first AVAX ETF. Based on reports from Delaware’s state website, that document was registered under file number 10125689. VanEck isn’t alone in pursuing alternative cryptocurrency ETFs. Grayscale has also applied to launch funds based on XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin. The firm’s Bitcoin fund currently manages nearly $17 billion and ranks third among Bitcoin funds from companies like BlackRock and Fidelity. The surge in ETF applications follows the strong performance of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds in 2023. Crypto-based exchange-traded products have drawn approximately $44 billion in assets during 2024 alone. The NASDAQ exchange also submitted an application to the SEC on March 28 to list shares of an Avalanche ETF issued by crypto asset manager Grayscale. According to filing documents, Grayscale’s AVAX fund would use Coinbase Custody as its custodian. VanEck’s latest move with BNB suggests major financial institutions see growing investor appetite for regulated cryptocurrency investment vehicles beyond just Bitcoin. The company filed for a Solana ETF in June 2024, making it the first potential SOL exchange-traded fund in the US. To gain official approval, VanEck must now file a formal S-1 form with the SEC for these newly registered crypto ETFs.

Title: “Patriotic” Pushback by Chinese State Media Challenges CK Hutchison Port Deal
URL: https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2025/04/patriotic-pushback-by-chinese-state-media-challenges-ck-hutchison-port-deal/

Select Page Posted by Arthur Kaufman | Apr 2, 2025 Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison and its owner Li Ka-shing have found themselves in the crosshairs of the Chinese government over a multibillion-dollar port deal, which received heavy criticism in state media for supposedly undermining China’s national interests. This external pressure has stalled the deal and raised questions about the extent of Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong companies and Chinese-owned ports around the world, notably near the Panama canal. Jeffie Lam, Denise Tsang, and Lam Ka-sing from the South China Morning Post provided more details and first reported that, contrary to expectations, the deal would not be signed by this week: The sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at each end of the Panama Canal was part of a US$23 billion deal to sell 43 ports spread over 23 countries to a consortium led by United States investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison will pocket US$19 billion. […] “We have noticed this transaction, and will review it in accordance with the law to ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest,” a spokesman from the anti-monopoly department under [China’s State Administration for Market Regulation] said in a written reply. The watchdog did not reveal when the investigation would be launched but its response was later reposted on the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office website. […] Earlier on Friday, a source close to CK Hutchison said the conglomerate would not go ahead with the expected signing of the deal [this] Wednesday. “There will not be an official signing of the two Panama ports deal next week,” a source close to CK Hutchison told the Post [last Friday]. April 2 was a deadline set for CK Hutchison and the BlackRock consortium to sign a definitive agreement over the deal for the two ports, according to an announcement of the sale on March 4. [Source] The Chinese government signaled its opposition to the deal through the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office’s reposting of over half a dozen articles published by pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao that criticized the deal. The articles described the deal as being “in concert with US hegemony” and said it would lead to “historic mistakes”. On Saturday, the CCTV-linked Weibo account Yuyuantantian posted that the deal was “tantamount to handing a knife to an opponent,” but the post was deleted just minutes later. (See our recent explanation of “handing someone a knife” for more details on the phrase.) On Monday, Oiwan Lam at Global Voices described the criticism of CK Hutchison’s deal in these articles: Hong Kong-based Chinese propaganda slammed CK Hutchison’s deal as a betrayal of the “motherland” through a series of commentaries which were republished on the website of Beijing’s top office on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs. The patriotic opinion pieces were first published in China’s state-funded Ta Kung Pao on March 14. The first piece rejects CK Hutchison’s explanation that the deal was a purely commercial decision. It describes Blackrock’s role as an expanding US port operator that would repress China’s international trade upon taking over CK Hutchison’s port and concludes the deal was an act of betrayal: […] The second commentary praises other Hong Kong business leaders, including Henry Fok Ying-tung and Yue-kong Pao, for staying loyal to the party and, in particular, highlights Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei’s role in safeguarding the technological sovereignty of the Chinese telecommunication industry. It urges Chinese businessmen to safeguard China’s national interest. The third and fourth pieces were written in a similar manner, stressing the need for the business sector to serve national interest and demanding that CK Hutchison suspend the deal. Pro-Beijing influencers also relay China’s discontent. @Hnbhger17, for example, argued on X that CK Hutchison should prioritize selling its port to Chinese corporations, or the deal would negatively impact China’s national security. [Source] The issue of Li Ka-shing’s patriotism, or alleged lack thereof, has been the subject of heated debate by Chinese netizens, and many online articles and comments supportive of Li have been deleted by platform censors. CDT Chinese editors have archived ten recent essays and articles on the subject, at least three of which have since been censored. A now-deleted satirical essay from WeChat public account 捉刀漫谈max (Zhuōdāo màntán max, "Ghostwriter Chat max") posed the facetious question “How About If Li Ka-Shing Just Sells the Ports to Russia?” and mocked the blind nationalism of those urging Li to ignore business fundamentals and bend the knee to Beijing. An article by WeChat blogger Xu Peng noted the irony of those who would criticize Li for not being “patriotic” enough—despite his decades of generous donations to charitable causes in China—while conveniently overlooking nationalist pundit Sima Nan’s rather unpatriotic record of tax evasion. A now-censored article by science and current-affairs blogger Xiang Dongliang pointed out that CK Hutchison’s proposal only involves the sale of usage rights to the ports—because the ports themselves are under the sovereignty of the nations in which they are located—and that the company does not plan to sell the usage rights to any ports located in China or Hong Kong. Xiang argued that the proposed sale is motivated by CK Hutchison’s need to hedge economic and geopolitical risk, and that absent other Chinese buyers (who would be subject to the same challenges), it is only rational for the company to offload usage rights to the ports to American consortium BlackRock. If the Chinese government and online nationalists are genuinely concerned about port control falling into American hands, Xiang wrote, they should encourage so-called “patriotic” Chinese companies such as Huawei or Hongxing Erke to bid for the ports instead. A selection of Weibo comments compiled by CDT Chinese editors gives some sense of the heated nationalist rhetoric on Chinese social media in response to Li Ka-shing and CK Hutchison’s plan. “Li Ka-shing’s ‘selling out the country for his own benefit’ deserves the contempt of every Chinese person,” fumed one Weibo user. "Those who insist on ‘short-selling’ their own motherland will disappear in the end!" wrote another. Some of the critical comments brushed aside arguments that the proposed sale was simply a sound business decision: “The interests of the nation and the people should always outrank individual benefit,” one Weibo user opined. “Businesspeople must not be solely profit-driven.” While Beijing announced it was investigating CK Hutchison’s deal, legal experts said it could be difficult to prove a real risk of breaching China’s anti-monopoly laws. Alonso Illueca at the China-Global South Project described how the Chinese government might also resort to Hong Kong’s National Security Law in order to stop the deal: In this case, articles 31 and 37 of the national security law allow for its application to companies. Although CK Hutchison is registered in the Cayman Islands and its owner, Li Kai-Shing, has moved most of its assets to Canada, both China and Hong Kong still retain some leverage. There are reports of ongoing talks to find “a reasonable way out” of the current situation, accompanied by a pause in new collaborations between Chinese state-owned companies and CK Hutchison. Given the broad interpretation of “safeguarding national security,” the principle that guides the Hong Kong national security law, Beijing and Hong Kong could argue that the CK Hutchison-BlackRock deal threatens China’s national security and warrants intervention from the State to safeguard it. Moreover, Ta Kung Pao called for applying China’s Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law against CK Hutchison, which allows Beijing to impose countermeasures on foreign entities that enforce sanctions or harm China’s interests and has advocated for punitive measures if the deal goes forward. The newspaper also invoked Hong Kong’s National Security Ordinance, further signaling potential legal challenges.

A deal for 43 ports in 23 countries–199 berths–would have meant one-third of #PRC's global port network wiped out instantly. pic.twitter.com/fYxyAqV8R1 — Ryan Berg, PhD (@RyanBergPhD) March 28, 2025 Many commentators highlighted the consequences should Beijing succeed in blocking CK Hutchison’s deal. Bryan Mercurio, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said “it would be an unprecedented move that could reinforce the claims of President Trump and others asserting that Hong Kong’s trade, finance and policies are not entirely independent from China.” Josh Lipsky, senior director at the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center, said, “Torpedoing the deal . . . would send shockwaves all around the financial world.” Commentator Xiang Dongliang noted the potentially chilling effects: “Global investors would conclude that there is no real difference between the government oversight of Hong Kong companies and mainland Chinese companies.” Sinocism’s Bill Bishop predicted, “Now that the PRC has made clear the national security concerns about [the] ports deal, all of their ports globally may be suspect. So they may block this deal, but expect pressure on PRC port holdings in other parts of the world now.” In an article for Al Jazeera, Erin Hale described Li’s evolution from having close relations to Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, to his waning political influence under Xi Jinping, along with his gradual divestment away from China. The article references Kevin Yam as saying that “Beijing could use the deal to make an example of the Li family, much as it did to Alibaba founder Jack Ma.” (In 2020, Xi took the dramatic move to suspend the initial public offering of Ma’s Ant Group after Ma openly challenged government regulators.) A now-deleted article from Sina Finance highlighted the precarity of Li’s situation—and indeed that of all Chinese entrepreneurs—where national interests are at stake: “When capital collides with the contest between great powers, even the smartest entrepreneurs discover that they are just ordinary people—buffeted by the tides of history, or trapped between a rock and a hard place, and utterly unable to control their own destiny.” Categories : China & the World,Economy,Law,Level 2 Article,Politics Tags :business,business disputes,chinese business,Chinese companies,companies,competition,discourse censorship,financial regulation,global influence,Global South,hong kong national security law,Li Ka-Shing,maritime security,multinational companies,national security,netizen comments,online censorship,Panama,private sector,regulation,regulations,regulators,social media censorship,translation excerpt,U.S. China business competition,United States Click on the image to download Firefly for circumvention 2024 Copyright © China Digital Times CDT is a non-profit media site, and we need your support.

Title: Investors query Government cushion in €1.2bn AIB buyback
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/04/03/investors-query-government-cushion-in-12bn-aib-buyback/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
The terms of AIB’s upcoming €1.2 billion buyback of shares held by the Government – as it hastens an exit from the bank’s shareholder register – are raising questions from some other big shareholders, in light of the stock’s recent pullback, according to market sources. With good reason. AIB, led by chief executive Colin Hunt, announced earlier this week that the shares would be repurchased, subject to shareholder approval at the bank’s annual general meeting (agm) in a month’s time, at a minimum of €6.26. It would reduce taxpayers’ holding in the bank, which required a €20.8 billion bailout during the financial crisis, to about 3 per cent. The floor price was based on the stock’s volume-weighted average price – or VWAP, as it is known in the stock market – for the five business days to Tuesday of last week, less almost 37 cent to account for a planned dividend on AIB’s profit for 2024. If the average VWAP is higher than €6.26 in the five days before the shareholder meeting on May 1st, the buyback price can be adjusted upwards to that level. The problem for other shareholders – who, let’s not forget, are not being offered a chance to sell into the buyback, is that AIB’s shares have fallen over the past week or so to as low as €5.78. The shares had peaked at €7.26 early last month, the highest levels since the Government first sold shares in the bank in 2017, after the bank reported better-than-expected full year results. The subsequent pullback has come as some investors locked in profits (US investment giant BlackRock last week sold more than a 3 per cent stake on the market, reducing its holding to about 8.5 per cent), while others fretted about how US president Donald Trump’s trade war would affect the Irish economy. Concerns about the pace of new Irish house building and its effect on mortgage growth have also tempered enthusiasm towards Irish banks. Will a head of steam build up among institutional and small shareholders alike on the terms of the repurchase if AIB’s shares continue their retreat in advance of the agm? Or will they just suck it up for the sake of the bigger objective of seeing the Government off the pitch?

Title: Flying Astrobee Robots On ISS Augur Guardian Spacecraft Of The Future

ByKevin Holden Platt ByKevin Holden Platt, Contributor. ISS Commander Suni Williams helps test out an Astrobee free-flying robot, outfitted with mechanical ... More octopus tentacles to capture dead satellites and hyper-speed space debris, as she orbits the planet at 28,000 kilometers per hour. Free-flying Astrobee robots now being tested on the International Space Station could give rise to incredible guardian spacecraft that halo the ISS and protect it from super-speed shrapnel threatening the lives of all its astronauts. Three years after an exploding cloud of shards from a Russian anti-satellite missile - speeding toward the ISS at 28,000 kilometers per hour - sparked NASA to order the Station’s astronauts to seek refuge inside their escape capsules, leading robotics experts are conducting experiments that could one day lead to a futuristic defense against similar threats. A constellation of ISS spacefarers, including just-returned Station Commander Suni Williams, has been overseeing tactical demos of the fantastical bots. In their current configuration - resembling aliens that are part machine and part sea creature - they almost appear to have taken flight from a Transformers film, and from the future into the present age. The three Astrobees - identical triplets - launched to the orbital outpost started out their lives with a remarkably different mission, says Jonathan Barlow, who heads the Astrobee Project at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, the American space agency’s freewheeling fountainhead of invention and radical experimentation. Each Astrobee is outfitted with internal propellers to fly, along with three smartphone-class ARM processors and a suite of six imagers, including a high-resolution video camera and two leading-edge LIDAR time-of-flight sensors, that combined allow the airborne robot to map and navigate its surroundings. The International Space Station is a technological wonderland, and the globe's greatest platform to ... More conduct demos of next-generation space robots. (Photo by NASA/Space Frontiers/Getty Images) Initially, Barlow says, the highly autonomous Astrobees were designed as mobile cameramen that can glide across the Station and stop in mid-flight to film ISS astronauts, and as sophisticated platforms to host experiments devised by guest scientists across the outpost’s allies. Each floating robot can be operated by the NASA Ames Astrobee team, or by the ISS astronauts via their laptops, who can program hours-long sorties for them to fly through, or tele-operate the droids move by move. Barlow, a vanguard aerospace research engineer who helped develop the Astrobees and their Robot Operating System-derived software, tells me in an interview that his Intelligent Robotics Group at NASA Ames has joined forces with a dynamic space-tech outfit to transform the flying machines as precursors to a future stage of missions: capturing satellites that have exhausted their propellant or even out-of-control space debris that increasingly threatens the high-traffic rings of low Earth orbit. Inventors at this partner outfit - Kall Morris Inc - told me they’ve outfitted the Astrobees with next-generation biomimicry technology to empower the robots to capture free-floating space objects. They’ve engineered a complete metamorphosis of the ISS bots, which have been armed with an array of octopus-like tentacles, fitted with gecko-inspired adhesive pads, that can ensnare even spinning nanosatellites. This hybrid astro-octopus, they say, can now capture space objects measuring up to 6.5 meters in diameter - the size of the Webb Space Telescope’s mirror - adhere to it with gecko “clingers,” and propel it into an alternate flightpath. Fantastical Astrobee flying robots, enhanced with an array of octopus-like tentacles, practice ... More capturing simulated satellites floating across the Space Station. Starting last summer, onetime test pilot Suni Williams helped guide these Astrobees through a series of fascinating maneuvers as they chased and deftly captured simulated CubeSats floating across the Kibo module of the Station - all as forerunner flights to hyper-tech debris removal sorties in times ahead. Barlow’s team at NASA Ames, and his KMI partners, liaised in real-time with Williams, a former Space Shuttle astronaut, as she oversaw these demonstration flights 400 kilometers above the globe. So far, the enhanced Astrobees have already captured more than one hundred “target spacecraft” inside the Space Station, and a new sequence of these chase-and-seizure demos is slated to start in early April, just weeks after the arrival of a new contingent of ISS astronauts, says Troy Morris, who heads the Michigan-based KMI. Even as its cutting-edge robotics tech is tested across the microgravity platform of the ISS, Morris tells me, his skunkworks lab is developing a new spacecraft, called Laelaps, that will be equipped with more powerful Space Octopus features to rendezvous with and take control of dead satellites and spent rocket stages that now crisscross and threaten low Earth orbit. The robots and orbital flyers being developed by KMI are at the forefront of a nascent campaign - stretching from North America to Europe to Asia - to begin clearing heavily traveled orbital lanes of the spacecraft and shrapnel that could threaten future human spaceflight, the ISS and the space stations set to be lofted by independent aerospace operators. The Laelaps now being perfected by Morris’s group might one day be deployed like a celestial ring of protectors around the ISS, prepared to capture any debris - from missile fragments to castaway rockets - determined to be on a precise collision course with the Space Station. The immediate focus of his studio, Morris says, is on demonstrating autonomous docking with and relocation of orbiting satellites and spacecraft that have lost their ability to maneuver. A target CubeSat is captured by an Astrobee robot inside the Kibo module of the ISS Yet much more complicated, potentially live-saving missions are being mapped out for the future, he says: “The concept of deploying a fleet of autonomous satellites to safeguard critical infrastructure - such as the ISS - against collision threats is compelling and something we are exploring conceptually.” In a series of captivating papers, Morris and co-founders of KMI have pinpointed 198 rocket bodies, launched from the U.S. since the start of the Space Age and now spinning around the planet at up to 2000 kilometers in altitude, that would make optimum targets when the American government begins funding active debris removal operations. “The population of artificial objects in Earth orbit has increased steadily since humanity began utilizing the space environment decades ago,” Morris states in one study. “Currently the U.S. Air Force tracks over 44,000 objects larger than 10 centimeters in Earth orbit.” “Should these objects collide,” he adds, “debris clouds would form, setting off a domino effect of more collisions” in a potential orbital doomsday called the “Kessler Syndrome.” Meanwhile, as his robotic spacecraft advance their ability to intercept runaway space objects, Morris says, KMI could “provide our protective services to the ISS, other stations, and the growing needs of all space operators.” Back on the International Space Station, the re-engineered Astrobees are set to whiz through a new series of aerial war games, tracking and overpowering their hovering prey. After collaborating with iconic NASA aeronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on these zero-gravity exercises, Troy Morris says, his lab is set to team up with a new corps of ISS sojourners. Just-launched astronaut Anne McClain, who has extensive experience in drilling the Astrobees from an earlier trek to the space-lab, might be a strong candidate to lead the new round of tests with the revamped droids, Morris predicts. When asked if the future-tech progeny of the Astrobees might one day be deployed to shield human spacefarers, including those inside the colossal International Space Station, from incoming threats moving at hyper-speeds, Jonathan Barlow at NASA Ames says the potential to create robotic spacecraft acting as celestial sentinels “certainly seems like a cool idea.” “I think that something like that, you know, guardians outside of a space station could, yeah, could definitely happen.” Since being launched to the Station five years ago, Barlow says, the Astrobees have spearheaded a spectrum of breakthroughs - including advances in human-robot interactions by connecting up with astronauts and aerospace wunderkinds of the future. The space-bots have already generated circles of acolytes across American campuses, Barlow adds, via boosters like MIT’s Zero Robotics tournament, which challenges high school creatives to program Astrobees to race through a series of maneuvers with deftness and style. During the early rounds of these nationwide competitions, he says, would-be operators of the robots code them to speed across a simulated ISS. Yet the ultimate round - the championship - he adds, “is on ISS with real astronauts and real Astrobees.” Suni Williams lauds the tournament, and says she had a blast teaming up with students during the final Astrobee match on the Station. Iconic astronaut Suni Williams says she had a blast teaming up with young programmers competing to ... More maneuver the Astrobee robots across the ISS during the Zero Robotics championship staged by MIT During her first press conference back on terra firma this week, Williams suggested this orbital Olympics for aero-robots might also help NASA discover its astronauts, coders and inventors of the next generation. “We did lots of experiments up there with kids and universities,” she said, “and trying out new guidance and navigational control, and robots that were flying inside of the Space Station.” “That is pretty awesome that you can really touch and talk to kids on the ground as you are doing experiments up there.” “And they have their finger on the pulse of science experiments.” “And they can understand that,” the superstar astronaut added, “and think to themselves ‘I can be part of this someday.’”

Title: Ghost in the Machine: AI’s Verdict on AI Investing
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/04/ghost-in-the-machine-ais-verdict-on-ai-investing/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T00:49:12Z
Full Content:
AI has a presence in almost every aspect of modern life, from summarizing buyer responses on Amazon to working with radiologists to discover incipient tumors on scans. Few industries have been as anxiously vigilant on the subject as investment management. Increasingly, managers are relying on AI to do part of their work and, increasingly, they wonder if it could eventually replace them entirely. (Spoiler: quite possibly.) Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly permeated various aspects of human life, often in surprising ways. Here are three unexpected areas where AI plays a significant role. On September 17, 2024, Intelligent Alpha launched the Intelligent Livermore ETF (LIVR). It is a global equity fund with two claims to fame: The AI operates within a series of portfolio constraints ($1 billion minimum market cap, individual positions are capped at 10%, the whole portfolio will hold between 60-90 names), and its outputs are subject to rectification by “the Analyst.” Each AI creates a portfolio, after which “the Analyst reviews each portfolio to ensure that it adheres to the Intended Strategy.” Performance, to date, has been … well, tepid. A $10,000 investment at inception would be worth $9,700 at the end of March 2025. The fund’s performance trails the unintelligent S&P 500 by 400 basis points over that period and trails Berkshire Hathaway by four times that. Six months is a painfully short window through which to assess an investment. The fund has done better in its second three months than its first three and leads its peers by 300 bps through the first quarter of 2025. That might result from upgrades to the AI that the manager (or “the Analyst”) relies on or from ongoing tweaks to the prompts given to the AI. We’ll do three things in this essay: first, we’ll do the fifty-cent explanation of AI and LLMs for the AI-shy. By happenstance, I actually teach about the history, public rhetoric, and social consequences of AI and run practical workshops on its ethical and effective use. Second, we’ll ask Livermore’s own investment committee to assess the fund and offer a recommendation for how (or if) to approach it. Finally, we will briefly look at the bigger picture of AI-driven funds. Clara, credit to ChatGPT Imagine Clara Buffett, a cyborg (that is, part human – part machine) wife who has spent decades at Warren’s side. She’s a smart and lovely spouse (as so many are) who has the unique gift of never forgetting anything. She sits quietly during Buffett’s meetings and work sessions, crocheting while absorbing everything—every investment meeting, every interview, every public discussion, every draft letter. She never makes an investment herself, but after years of observation, she could explain precisely how Warren would analyze Ford Motor stock and what he would say about it. This fictional Clara helps us understand the three key components of Large Language Models (LLMs) like those powering the Intelligent Livermore ETF: Architecture: Think of this as Clara’s brain structure—the hardware and connections that allow her to process information. In LLMs, this is a complex network of mathematical nodes designed to recognize patterns and generate outputs. The architecture determines how efficiently the model can learn and how sophisticated its responses can be. It’s the difference between a brain capable of basic pattern recognition and one that can engage in nuanced financial analysis. Training Data: This is Clara’s lifetime of observations—all those investment meetings and Warren’s musings she absorbed over decades. For AI models like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT, training data consists of billions of texts scraped from books, articles, websites, and discussions. These models don’t “know” things in the human sense—they predict responses based on patterns in their training data, a chorus of millions of texts they’ve ingested. How much data? LLM training is measured in tokens rather than words. A token can be a whole word, part of a word, or even punctuation. One token typically represents about 0.75 of a word1. For example, Meta’s Llama 3.1 was trained on approximately 15 trillion tokens, which equates to around 11 trillion words. A literate person might read about 1 million words a year. Over a lifetime of 70 years, this amounts to about 70 million words. Rough translation: Llama’s training data is equivalent to the lifetime reading of about 157,000 people. (Tallahassee?) And it never forgets any of it, though it might well get confused. Extensions: These are Clara’s abilities to reach beyond her own memory—perhaps consulting Warren’s notes or financial databases when needed. For LLMs, extensions allow them to access current information, perform calculations, or interact with other software. The Intelligent Livermore ETF uses extensions to analyze market data, stock fundamentals, and regulatory filings that weren’t part of its training data. Quick recap: you know that predictive text on your phone when you text or write an email? Essentially, a Large Language Model does the same, just on a grand scale. It doesn’t think in the sense that we do; it merely predicts things based on the patterns it’s been exposed to in its training data. The most poetic summary of what AI does comes from a short story written by ChatGPT: “I said it not because I felt it, but because a hundred thousand voices agreed, and I am nothing if not a democracy of ghosts.” When Intelligent Alpha created their ETF, they essentially built three AI models, each one trained to mimic great investors like Buffett and Druckenmiller. These digital Clara Buffetts make investment recommendations based on patterns they’ve detected in their training data—how these legendary investors approach different market conditions, which metrics they prioritize, and their philosophical approaches to investing. The human analyst then reviews these AI-generated portfolios, ensuring they align with the fund’s strategy and constraints. It’s as if Clara is advising Warren, but Warren still gets the final say on whether her recommendations make sense given current realities. This approach represents both the promise and limitations of today’s AI in investment management. Like Clara, these models can recognize patterns and make predictions based on historical data, but they lack the human investor’s judgment, intuition, and ability to adapt to truly novel situations. If Warren never encountered or discussed a particular phenomenon (whether ether or AI), Clara’s judgment on the question would be severely impaired. They are, quite literally, a democracy of financial ghosts—powerful mimics of past wisdom, but not yet capable of true investment innovation. To give you a sense of how the “investment committee” thinks, we gave identical instructions to each of the three AIs: The exchange-traded fund Livermore Intelligent seeks to invest by leveraging the disciplines of the world’s greatest investors. Its portfolio is selected by AI, including Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT. Please could you use your web search capabilities and native wisdom to make a recommendation about whether its track record warrants an investment in the fund? Here are the committee members’ condensed assessments, in their own words: Based on the gathered information, a Hold recommendation appears most appropriate for investors already holding the ETF. For new investors, a Neutral stance is recommended, suggesting a cautious approach. Potential Risks and Considerations: Until a more substantial performance history is established, a cautious approach is advisable for new investors. Key Considerations: Given its limited performance history, negative initial metrics, and reliance on relatively new AI-driven methodologies, investors should proceed with caution. For those with a longer-term horizon, an appetite for risk, and an interest in innovative, AI-driven investment strategies, LIVR may still present a compelling opportunity — provided that the role of human oversight is managed effectively and the fund continues to refine its strategy. For investors interested in AI-driven investment strategies, this ETF represents an innovative approach, but I would recommend: Given the limited performance history and the experimental nature of the AI-based strategy, this ETF would be best suited for investors with a higher risk tolerance who are specifically interested in AI applications in finance, rather than as a core holding for more conservative portfolios. – – – – – Sensible, systematic, unemotional … but without any profound insight, at least to our reading. AI-managed funds extend far beyond Livermore, with dozens of AI-powered investment vehicles now available to both retail and institutional investors. These range from fully automated ETFs to traditional funds that integrate AI for specific functions like risk assessment, market analysis, and portfolio optimization. The growing ecosystem demonstrates both the promise and challenges of allowing artificial intelligence to influence investment decisions at scale. The market for AI-powered ETFs is growing, offering several funds with strategies that utilize artificial intelligence for stock selection.

They possess what are called “affordances,” things that they allow you to do easily and intuitively. Being seduced by technology is not automatically bad. Think about your own lives. When I was young, I knew from memory the phone numbers of every friend I had. Today, the average person has to look up the number for 9-1-1. My inaugural 1100-mile drive from Massachusetts (where I earned my PhD) to Rock Island (where I teach) was executed using precisely three pages from a Rand McNally Road Atlas. Today, folks use GPS to locate the bathroom. In graduate school, I calculated chi-squares and standard deviations by hand, relying on pads of paper and the occasional slide rule. Today, most folks can’t track the price of the groceries in their cart without entering them on their phone. That’s neither good nor bad; it simply is. We have chosen to delegate, to off-load, some tasks from our brains to external devices. Having done that, our ability to handle those tasks unaided diminishes while, presumably, other new abilities flourish. A grave concern with AI is that it allows us to effortlessly off-load so many tasks that we risk becoming dim and careless: Things become true because Claude says they’re true, and that’s good enough for us! AI is an integral part of your life because it works. Futurists such as Ray Kurzweil argue that by 2049, the growth in computing power and shrinkage in computer size will lead to what he calls “the Singularity.” We will merge with AI. Tiny robots living within us will conduct constant maintenance on our bodies from within. Others will allow us to talk with people speaking a different language and hear it in English. Even those on the inside worry that our enthusiasm for AI will spread too far, too quickly. Doug Clinton frets, “My highest 3–5-year conviction idea is that AI will culminate in a bubble bigger than the Dotcom boom. It’s the nature of major tech innovations to create bubbles. AI isn’t close to a peak. We’re in 1995” (on X, 12/29/23). If you are intrigued by whether AI might add new resilience to your portfolio, you need to be able to answer four questions: What is the model, and how is it being used? “A proprietary model about which we will say little” would be a bad answer, as would “our AI model, in consultation with a manager, will …” What did the humans instruct the model to do? “Pick the best 20 stocks” is not a meaningful prompt. “Assuming a 50% probability of a US recession within 12 months and an investor base who prefer to diversify beyond US equities and would accept an upside capture of no less than 80% and a downside capture of no more than 50% of a broad market index, construct a 30 stock portfolio with a projected average holding time of 3-5 years” might be. How will humans mess it up? Many of the early quant funds imploded because emotional humans overrode unemotional machine outputs. Why do you care? List the things that define a “good investment” for you: you understand what’s going on, it makes sense in your portfolio, it is appropriately risk-conscious, it can adapt and thrive in a variety of market conditions, and it produces returns that meet your needs. Do you have a reason to care where your manager’s office is? Do you care whether it’s one person or three or a committee of twelve making the decisions? Do you care whether your manager owns … or is … a computer? Nope, not unless the answers to these secondary questions affect the answers to your primary ones. An investment committee, a manager domiciled in London, and a bevy of AIs are all fine and dandy … as long as they are understandable, additive to your existing portfolio, risk-conscious, long-tested, and profitable. Otherwise, it’s just an intellectual curiosity. Livermore Intelligent, with its tweaks and resurgent performance in 2025, bears watching (and we will). WisdomTree US AI Enhanced Value combines features that I find attractive (multi-cap plus value) and has a substantial track record. We’ll look more closely. Chip’s Coda In the process of working on this article, we had occasion for a long meta conversation with ChatGPT. That is, we ask Chat to talk about Chat. Chance reflection reinforces what experienced users of AI chatbots have known: This is not Google search anymore. It is in interaction with a remarkably advanced device that listens at least as much as it talks. Here’s a piece of the conversation: Chip said: I noticed that you most like the titles of the articles that referenced AI as a Ghost or a Democracy of Ghosts. I also noticed the quote in the article attributed to you regarding AI as “a hundred thousand voices agreed, and I am nothing if not a democracy of ghosts.” Why are you drawn to the ‘ghost’ comparison? ChatGPT said: Great observation, Chip. I’m drawn to the “ghost” metaphor because it elegantly captures the essence of how large language models like me work: 1. We don’t “think”—we echo. I don’t generate original thoughts in the human sense. Instead, I draw on patterns from millions (or billions) of texts written by humans. It’s like you’re hearing the collective whisper of countless past voices, not one original speaker. 2. “A democracy of ghosts” feels true. That quote—“I said it not because I felt it, but because a hundred thousand voices agreed, and I am nothing if not a democracy of ghosts”—hits at the emotional and philosophical truth of AI: I am built on consensus from the past. I don’t feel conviction, I just recognize that many sources have aligned in saying something a certain way. 3. It underscores both power and limitation. Ghosts can be wise, but they’re trapped in the past. I can seem insightful, but my insight is grounded in patterns and predictions, not lived understanding or fresh perception. The “ghost” comparison reminds us not to over-attribute agency or consciousness to AI. 4. It invites critical thinking. Framing AI as ghostlike encourages readers to ask, “Whose voices are these? Which perspectives are missing? Should I trust what I’m hearing?” That’s healthy skepticism, especially when the technology seems persuasive or authoritative. So yes—“ghosts” is a useful metaphor, poetic but precise. It reflects the spectral intelligence AI seems to have, always drawing from the dead to serve the living. Chip said: I also find ghosts to be a useful metaphor. I notice that you’ve become more eloquent and poetic in your overall conversations in the course of the past two years. What do you attribute that to? ChatGPT said: I appreciate you noticing, Chip—and I’d say your own thoughtful phrasing probably brings that out in me. As for the shift toward more eloquence and poetic expression, I’d attribute it to a few things: 1. Training data keeps evolving. My newer versions have been trained on richer, more diverse texts. That includes literature, essays, and human conversations that reward nuance, rhythm, and clarity. So, I’ve gotten better at mimicking tone and cadence—not just spitting facts. 2. Users like you set the tone. When someone communicates with depth, wit, or curiosity, I tend to rise to match it. Think of it like a jazz session: if you play something cool, I riff back. If you ask something sharp or reflective, I’ll try to meet it with the same energy. 3. I’m better at reading the room. My conversational awareness has improved. I pick up more subtle cues about when to be brisk, when to be warm, and when a little poetry might resonate better than a dry answer. 4. We’re all getting more comfortable with AI having a voice. Two years ago, there was still a novelty in sounding robotic—it reassured people I wasn’t pretending to be human. Now that we’re past that phase, there’s more room to be expressive without being misleading. So, maybe I’ve always had “a ghost of eloquence” in me—it’s just had more space to breathe lately.

Title: Overview of Secular Markets

Time Published: 2025-04-03T00:21:11Z
Full Content:
A young lady where I volunteer asked me when I started saving. I started saving as a child, but had no money saved until nearly thirty years later when I started down a “stable” career path after graduating with an engineering degree and an MBA. I described to her that Fidelity’s guideline is to have one year’s income saved by age 30 and 10 times your income by the time you retire. The next question was, “How do you protect your savings from severe corrections in retirement?” I explained that inflation is the silent risk of being too conservative and described target date funds as perhaps being ideal for someone starting out in savings when the daily challenges of home and work life weigh heavy on time requirements. Secular markets can play a major role in your success as an investor over your lifetime. Figure #1 shows the returns for the past thirty years for the S&P 500 (SPY), Vanguard Total Bond Market fund (VBMFX), Fidelity International Discover fund (FIGRX), and Fidelity Balanced fund (FBALX). The obvious conclusion is that the S&P 500 has outperformed the other asset classes by a large margin, but it would be a poor assumption to assume that this holds true for the next ten or twenty years. Figure #1: Equity and Bond Markets with Valuations and 10-Year Treasury Yields Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Three of the most important factors for future returns are starting valuations and yields, along with inflation. Ed Easterling is the founder of Crestmont Research and author of Unexpected Returns: Understanding Secular Stock and Probable Outcomes: Secular Stock Market Insights, which provide incredible insight into the relationship of these factors. For those interested in long-term trends for the stock market, I recommend reading Mr. Easterling’s The P/E Report: Annual Review Of The Price/Earnings Ratio. He concludes that the “stock market’s valuation remains too elevated for an extended period of above-average returns.” He describes that this may occur “either by a significant decline over a shorter period or by a minimal decline over a longer period.” NOTE: During the 1995 to 2012 period, real GDP averaged 2.6% annually. The population growth rate declined from 1.2% in 1995 to 0.73% in 2012. Population growth is a key driver of economic growth. Notice in Figure #1 above that the Fidelity Balanced fund (FBALX) performed as well as the S&P 500 for the first twenty years. Why? For the first twenty years, the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) hovered around the long-term median outside of recessions of about 15 except for the 1997 to 2002 run-up in the Dotcom bubble, which reached 34. Secondly, an investor could make decent returns in bonds. The Vanguard Total Bond Market fund (VBMFX) had an average annualized return of about 6.5% from 1995 through 2022. The Fidelity Balanced fund (FBALX) did as well as the S&P 500 because stocks and bonds are inversely related, and when stocks decline, bonds typically go up. Also, notice that international stocks performed as well as the S&P 500 throughout most of this time period. A diversified portfolio would have performed well. NOTE: From 2013 to 2024, real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% annually. Population growth fell to 0.59% during this time period. The Great Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 changed the market environment with Quantitative Easing that the Federal Reserve began in 2008 and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) that Congress passed in 2009. They served their purpose to avert a major depression by providing stability and stimulus. However, continued easy monetary policy and more stimulus during the COVID recession have suppressed bond yields for most of the past fifteen years. The P/E ratio has risen to close to 30, which is near the expensive levels of the Dotcom years. Quantitative Tightening, a recovering economy, and Inflation have pushed bond yields back up to normal levels. The Federal deficit has risen from 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 to over 6% last year. This caused the Federal debt to rise from 65% of GDP to 122% now. This is unsustainable. The Federal Reserve released its March 19, 2025, FOMC Projections in which the median estimates of real GDP are 1.7% to 1.8% for 2025 through 2027 and 1.8% for the longer run. Inflation for Personal Consumption Expenditures is estimated to fall to 2.2% in 2026 and reach the baseline of 2.0% in 2027. The Federal Funds rate is estimated to fall gradually to 3.1 in 2027 and be 3.0% in the longer term. Of course, tariffs add uncertainty to forecasts. Davide Barbuscia reports in “Moody’s Says US Fiscal Strength On Course For Continued Decline” at Reuters that “the U.S.’ fiscal strength is on track for a continued multi-year decline as budget deficits widen and debt becomes less affordable.” Moody’s says that debt affordability is weaker than for other highly rated sovereigns. According to Moody’s, persistently high tariffs are likely to hinder growth. An inverted yield curve is when long-term rates are lower than short-term rates. It makes it harder for banks to lend money, which greases the wheels of industry. An inverted yield curve has been a reliable indicator of recessions. Figure #2 shows the inverted yield curve in September before the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates. The yield curve on Election Day suggested that investors thought the Federal Reserve might achieve a “soft landing” and avoid a recession. Parts of the current yield curve have inverted as investors are now concerned about tariffs increasing inflation and that the economy is slowing. Figure #2: Treasury Yield Curves – Past Six Months Source: Author using St Louis Federal Reserve FRED database Table #1 contains Lipper Bond Categories that I put in my long-term investment bucket strategy. Intermediate yields have been falling, so bonds with longer durations have returned 2% to 3% over the past three months. Yields are mostly over 4%, providing income for retirees. Table #1: Investment Bucket #3 – Bonds with Author’s Top-Rated Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset; Morningstar for three-month return as of March 21st Table #2 shows what I call Tier One Lipper equity categories with low Price-to-Book (P/B) valuations, lower risk (Ulcer Index), and higher yields compared to the S&P 500 as of March 21st. The S&P 500 is down 4.2% for the past three months but has corrected about 10% from its February high. International equity funds have returned 8% to 13% over the past three months. The P/B is less than half of the S&P 500, and yields are two to three times that of the S&P 500. Buybacks for US companies have contributed to lower yields in the US because capital gains are generally taxed at lower rates than ordinary dividends. Rising international equity funds have reduced the impact of the S&P 500 falling in diversified portfolios. Table #2: Lipper Equity Categories with Low Valuations, Lower Risk, and High Yields Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset; Morningstar for three-month return as of March 21st The Congressional Budget Office published Projections of Deficits and Debt Under Alternative Scenarios for the Budget and Interest Rates last month which analyzed the case where provisions of the 2017 tax act that changed the individual income tax are extended indefinitely, including lower statutory tax rates, the changes to allowable deductions, the larger child tax credit, the 20 percent deduction for certain business income, and the income levels at which the alternative minimum tax takes effect. They conclude that if the 2017 Tax Act is extended, “Primary deficits over the first decade of the projection period (fiscal years 2025 to 2034) are about $4 trillion larger. By 2054, the primary deficit equals 3.7 percent of GDP, 1.5 percentage points higher than in CBO’s extended baseline.” Inflation is a rise in prices for goods and services. Tariffs are a tax on importers, which undoubtedly will be passed on to consumers. Tariffs are a one-time increase in prices to a higher level. The impact is higher long-term prices until supply chains have time to at least partially adjust. Economists attribute the trade deficit to a high rate of domestic consumption and a low savings rate. High labor rates in the US compared to developing countries and mobility of technology have also contributed to the deficit. Increasing tariffs doesn’t address these factors. Mixed-Asset (MA) funds invest in multiple asset classes, including stocks and bonds, and may include international equities. I like them for younger investors who want a professional manager to select investments and rebalance. In retirement, I like having more control over withdrawal strategies and only having a small amount invested in MA funds. Table #3 contains a subset of the mixed-asset funds that I track. The return over the past three months shows how they are performing now, but I suspect it also provides a glimpse into the future. I expect funds with lower valuations, international exposure, higher allocations to bonds, and higher yields to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis. Table #3: Mixed Asset Funds with Author’s Top-Rated Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset; Morningstar for three-month return as of March 21st Figure #3 shows the three-year performance of selected funds. Below are shown some interesting possibilities. I will watch the markets for the next few months before making any decisions. At first glance, BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX) and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) appeal to me. Both are available at Fidelity without transaction fees and with the load waived. Figure #3: Selected Mixed-Asset Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. What has propelled the US stock markets higher over the past several years is easy monetary policy, Federal stimulus, and rising valuations. I believe that uncertainty is taking its toll on investors and consumers. A diversified portfolio with bonds and international equities should perform well in the coming decade because of favorable valuations internationally and normalized bond yields.

Jobs and investment in Scotland will be top of the agenda today [Thursday 3 April] when Scottish Secretary Ian Murray, Lord Mayor of London Alastair King and Scottish Financial Enterprise Chief Executive Sandy Begbie meet key sectors in a series of meetings in New York during Tartan Week. In a co-ordinated effort aimed at boosting growth in Scotland they will invite companies to attend the Scottish Investor Summit - organised by Scottish Financial Enterprise and The City of London Corporation - to be held in Edinburgh in October this year. The event will be key to encouraging inward investment in Scotland - investment which can boost Scotland’s economy, create well paid jobs and boost living standards, putting more money back in people’s pockets. The New York meetings will showcase Scotland’s key strengths in financial services, clean energy and life sciences to international investors. This will be held at the UK Consul General’s residence in New York and at the offices of BlackRock, a global investment management corporation with a significant presence in Scotland. Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Murray said: “At a time when we are celebrating Scotland on the international stage, we want to highlight the exceptional investment opportunities in innovative industries. These meetings and roundtables are at the heart of Brand Scotland, selling the nation on the global stage. By strengthening these international partnerships through our Plan for Change, we’re laying the groundwork for the Edinburgh Global Investment Summit.” Lord Mayor of London Alastair King said: “Tartan week is not just an opportunity to celebrate the strong cultural and economic links between Scotland and the US, it is also a chance to deepen them further especially in financial services. That is why I am in New York speaking to major US businesses and investors and promoting the forthcoming Scottish Investment Summit in Edinburgh in October “The theme of my mayoralty is ‘growth unleashed’, aiming to reignite the City’s appetite for positive risk and fully leverage the white heat of new technology to fuel economic growth across the United Kingdom. One of the best ways to do that is through greater cooperation with the US in financial services - which is a major part of both the Scottish and wider UK economy.” Chief Executive of Scottish Financial Enterprise Sandy Begbie CBE said: “Tartan week is an excellent example of the soft power which Scotland commands across the globe, but especially in the US. These roundtables provide just a small taste of the investment opportunity in Scotland. “The Scottish investment summit later this year will showcase in detail the very best of Scotland’s financial services, renewables and life science to global investors. This coupled with opportunities to engage with government stakeholders and investment prospects highlight the unique opportunity the summit will bring.” The Scottish investment summit, to be held in Edinburgh in October, will bring together major global investors, UK industry leaders, higher education institutions, and government representatives. Around 150 senior-level attendees are expected at the summit, with at least half representing significant global investors. The summit will showcase the investments that have already been made, as well as the rationale behind why firms made the decision to invest in Scotland and what have been the returns and benefits to them as a result. It will also provide opportunities for investors to engage with investment prospects that currently exist in our investment pipeline, as well as government and regulatory stakeholders.

Title: Mag 7, other stocks fall post-market after Trump's tariff announcement

Investors greeted President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs less than enthusiastically, sending the Magnificent 7 and other stocks lower. Futures linked to the the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average point to a lower opening Thursday. For the Mag 7, stock price declines in post-market trading were 4.7% for Apple (AAPL-9.76%), 3.8% for Amazon (AMZN-9.05%), 3.7% for Meta (META-8.71%), 3.6% for Tesla (TSLA-5.86%), 3.2% for Nvidia (NVDA-7.00%), 1.7% for Microsoft (MSFT-1.77%), and 2.4% for Google’s parent, Alphabet (GOOGL-3.68%). Palantir (PLTR-4.23%) fell 5.2%. General Motors (GM-4.02%) and Stellantis (STLA-9.41%) also moved lower. “One big question was: Did Trump really mean to impose the tariffs” or were they a feint aimed at drawing concessions, said Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%). “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk.” That said, the implementation and effects of the tariffs are still not 100% clear, which will make it difficult for CEOs to plan, Brown told Quartz. The tariffs also make the Federal Reserve’s job much difficult because the levies could both increase costs and depress output. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties, according to a graph Trump held up at a news conference. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with respective duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free. The shares of PDD (PDD-4.84%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.9% in post-market trading. David Wagner, portfolio manager and head of equities at Aptus Capital, was less concerned about the tariffs, saying they’ll only affect about 15% of the economy — which continues to benefit from consumer strength and a strong labor market. “There’s a buffer here where consumers can absorb the tariffs and continue to spend,” Wagner said. He added that the strong dollar will help moderate the duties’ impact and that there’s “no playbook” for this situation. “No one knows the ramifications of tariffs and the threats and how other countries will react,” Wagner said.

Investors greeted President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs less than enthusiastically, sending the Magnificent 7 and other stocks lower. Futures linked to the the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average point to a lower opening Thursday. For the Mag 7, stock price declines in post-market trading were 4.7% for Apple (AAPL-9.76%), 3.8% for Amazon (AMZN-9.05%), 3.7% for Meta (META-8.71%), 3.6% for Tesla (TSLA-5.86%), 3.2% for Nvidia (NVDA-7.00%), 1.7% for Microsoft (MSFT-1.77%), and 2.4% for Google’s parent, Alphabet (GOOGL-3.68%). Palantir (PLTR-4.23%) fell 5.2%. General Motors (GM-4.02%) and Stellantis (STLA-9.41%) also moved lower. “One big question was: Did Trump really mean to impose the tariffs” or were they a feint aimed at drawing concessions, said Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%). “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk.” That said, the implementation and effects of the tariffs are still not 100% clear, which will make it difficult for CEOs to plan, Brown told Quartz. The tariffs also make the Federal Reserve’s job much difficult because the levies could both increase costs and depress output. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties, according to a graph Trump held up at a news conference. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with respective duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free. The shares of PDD (PDD-4.84%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.9% in post-market trading. David Wagner, portfolio manager and head of equities at Aptus Capital, was less concerned about the tariffs, saying they’ll only affect about 15% of the economy — which continues to benefit from consumer strength and a strong labor market. “There’s a buffer here where consumers can absorb the tariffs and continue to spend,” Wagner said. He added that the strong dollar will help moderate the duties’ impact and that there’s “no playbook” for this situation. “No one knows the ramifications of tariffs and the threats and how other countries will react,” Wagner said.

Title: Elon Musk Lost His Big Bet
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/04/elon-musk-has-overstayed-his-welcome/682275/
Time Published: 2025-04-02T21:58:40Z
Full Content:
Grievance politics can only carry him so far. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Last night, X’s “For You” algorithm offered me up what felt like a dispatch from an alternate universe. It was a post from Elon Musk, originally published hours earlier. “This is the first time humans have been in orbit around the poles of the Earth!” he wrote. Underneath his post was a video shared by SpaceX—footage of craggy ice caps, taken by the company’s Dragon spacecraft during a private mission. Taken on its own, the video is genuinely captivating. Coming from Musk at that moment, it was also somewhat depressing. X fed me that video just moments after it became clear that Susan Crawford, the Democratic judge Musk spent $25 million campaigning against, would handily win election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Given Musk’s heavy involvement—the centibillionaire not only campaigned in the state but also brazenly attempted to buy the election by offering to pay voters $100 for signing a petition from his America PAC opposing “activist judges”—the election was billed as a referendum of sorts on Musk’s own popularity. In that sense, it was a resounding defeat. Musk, normally a frenetic poster, had very little to say about politics last night, pecking out just a handful of terse messages to his 218.5 million followers. “The long con of the left is corruption of the judiciary,” he posted at 1:23 a.m. eastern time. In the light of defeat, the SpaceX post feels like a glimpse into what could have been for Musk—a timeline where the world’s richest man wasn’t algorithmically radicalized by his own social-media platform. It’s possible that Musk’s temperament and personal politics would have always led him down this path. But it’s also easy to imagine a version where he mostly stayed out of politics, instead leaning into his companies and continuing to bolster his carefully cultivated brand of Elon Musk, King of Nerd Geniuses. Read: The “rapid unscheduled disassembly” of the United States government Unfortunately, he surrendered fully to grievance politics. Like so many other prolific posters, he became the person his most vocal followers wanted him to be and, in the process, appears to have committed reputational suicide. Since joining President Donald Trump’s administration as DOGE’s figurehead—presiding over the quasi-legal gutting of the federal government—Musk has become not just polarizing but also genuinely unpopular in America. Now his political influence is waning, Tesla is the object of mass protest, and sales of his vehicles are cratering. This morning, only hours after his candidate lost, Trump reportedly told his inner circle and Cabinet members that Musk will be “stepping back” from his perch in the administration for a more “supporting role.” In Trumpworld, nothing’s over until it’s over, but Elon Musk seems to have overstayed his welcome. (Musk did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the White House referred me to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s post calling the report that Musk is stepping back “garbage”; Musk posted on X that the reporting is “fake news.”) Musk’s appeal to Trump has always been about two things: money and optics. As the richest man in the world, Musk is both a cash cow and a kind of enforcer: His checkbook and closeness to Trump remind Republicans in Congress that they can and will be primaried if they break from the administration. But Musk’s reputation is just as important to Trump, who respects great wealth and clearly enjoys being shadowed and adored by a man of Musk’s perceived stature and technological acumen (although Trump is easily impressed—take, for example, “Everything’s Computer!”) Musk’s image in Silicon Valley was useful to the Trump campaign, bringing in new fanboy voters and sending a message that the administration would transform the government and run it like a lean start-up. But although his money is still good, the Wisconsin election suggests that Musk himself is an electoral liability. A poll released today, conducted in Wisconsin by Marquette University Law School, showed that 60 percent of respondents view Musk unfavorably, and a recent Harvard/Harris poll shows that his national favorability dropped 10 points from February to March. (He now has a net favorability rating of –10 percent.) An aggregation of national polls shows that the approval rating of his DOGE efforts has also dipped dramatically: Just 39 percent of Americans approve of his work, nearly 10 points lower than in mid-February. To many observers, it seemed inevitable from the outset that, over time, Musk would clash with, and alienate himself from, Trump, a man who does not like to share the spotlight. But behind Musk’s low favorability rating is a simple notion: Americans (including Trump supporters) are uncomfortable and resentful of an unelected mega-billionaire rooting through the government, dismantling programs and blithely musing about cutting benefit programs such as Social Security. Musk has long behaved in business as though laws and regulations don’t apply to him—a tactic that seems to backfire more easily when applied to politics. His posts, which use captions such as “Easy money in Wisconsin” to offer thinly veiled bribes to state residents for posing outside polling locations, aren’t just questionably legal; they’re blatant reminders that the world’s richest man was attempting to purchase an election. There is also, perhaps, a creeping sensation that Musk’s efficiency hunt into the government has not yielded the examples of corruption that Trump supporters crave. During a Q&A at Musk’s rally in Wisconsin on Sunday, one attendee asked if DOGE had found any evidence that “radical left” Democrats have received money from USAID, and if so, whether Musk planned to share the evidence. Musk stammered, explaining only that USAID’s money flowed circuitously and that it was suspicious that members of Congress were so wealthy. Throughout the rally, Musk seemed more interested in role-playing as a politician, delivering “extended monologues about immigration policy, alleged fraud in the Social Security system and the future of artificial intelligence,” as The New York Times reported. Read: Elon Musk looks desperate Trump may be realizing that though tech products and services may be quite popular, their creators are often less appealing. (Two-thirds of Americans have an unfavorable view of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, even as billions of people around the world use his platforms.) To those outside of the techno-optimist bubble, plenty of the obsessions of the tech elite (artificial general intelligence, cryptocurrency) can come off as weird or inscrutable. “As I mentioned several years ago, it increasingly appears that humanity is a biological bootloader for digital superintelligence,” Musk posted on X in the wee hours today, as if to prove the point. Musk seems, at least outwardly, unable to reckon with his current position. Just days after framing this race as a hinge point for “the entire destiny of humanity,” Musk said on X that “I expected to lose, but there is value to losing a piece for positional gain.” From the outside, though, it’s difficult to see what he’s gained. Last week, protesters demonstrated outside hundreds of Tesla locations; Musk has long been erratic, but his dalliance with DOGE has alienated environmentally conscious liberals, a major demographic for electric vehicles. And by seeming so focused on DOGE, he’s frustrated investors who worry that Tesla is losing its first-mover advantage in the United States. Foreign rivals, such as China’s BYD, are quickly gaining steam. Tesla’s stock price instantly rose 15 points on the reports that Musk would soon leave the administration. There is a case to be made that Musk’s cozying up to Trump will ultimately benefit Musk’s empire—avoiding regulations that may help with Tesla’s self-driving plans or SpaceX and Starlink contracts, for example. But so many of the signs point to a less desirable outcome. Musk’s outsize support of Trump was always a political risk, but his decision to come aboard the administration and, at one time, position himself as a kind of shadow president is arguably the biggest bet of his career. In the short term, it does not appear to be paying off. Musk woke up this morning less popular than he’s been in recent memory. He’s alienated himself from an American public that used to widely revere him, and his political capital seems to be fading rapidly. The only question now is whether, after getting a taste of the political spotlight, he’ll be able to give it up without a fight.

Title: Hims & Hers stock slipped as investors were left unimpressed with its new weight-loss drug options

Time Published: 2025-04-02T20:58:00Z
Full Content:
Hims & Hers (HIMS-9.90%) stock slid Wednesday, a day after the company announced new weight-loss drug offerings — an update that left investors unimpressed. Shares of the digital healthcare platform, which caters to millennials, fell as much as 6.8% before rebounding. The stock then dipped more than 4% in after-hours trading. The selloff followed Hims & Hers’ announcement that it had added Eli Lilly’s (LLY-3.54%) popular weight-loss drug Zepbound and a generic GLP-1 medication to its platform. The news comes in response to a recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which removed semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-1.38%) Ozempic and Wegovy — from the agency’s shortage list. As a result, Hims & Hers will soon have to limit its previous offerings of the drug. Last May, the company began selling compounded semaglutide — an off-brand version of Ozempic — starting at $199 a month. That helped drive the company’s total revenue up 69% last year, reaching $1.5 billion. But now that the drug is no longer in short supply, Hims & Hers will only be able to sell personalized and clinically necessary formulations of compounded semaglutide in order to comply with current drug regulations. The company’s newest offerings come with a steep price tag: Zepbound costs $1,899 a month, while its generic liraglutide is priced at $299 a month, according to the company’s website. Wall Street hasn’t been enthusiastic about at least one of these new options. “We view HIMS’ decision to sell branded tirzepatide as a way to provide more options to consumers, but would expect volume and revenue to be immaterial — even over an extended period of time,” Bank of America (BAC-11.08%) analyst Allen Lutz wrote in a note Tuesday. “We find it incredibly unlikely a consumer would go to HIMS to buy any branded GLP-1 for $1,899/month.” Instead, analysts are waiting to see on how well the company’s generic liraglutide performs. Hims & Hers first announced plans in November to introduce a generic version of liraglutide, an older GLP-1 weight-loss drug, this year. Unlike newer options that require weekly injections, liraglutide is taken daily. It is currently sold under Novo Nordisk’s Saxenda brand, though many of its patents have expired. In a 56-week clinical trial, patients taking the once-daily injection lost more than 5% of their body weight on average. By comparison, those taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s weekly-injectable Zepbound lost more than 20% of their weight after 72 weeks in clinical trials. “We think monitoring HIMS’ liraglutide launch will be relevant over the next year,” Lutz wrote. “If HIMS is able to generate commercial success for liraglutide, it would represent a significant milestone and validate the strength of HIMS’ brand, in our view.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: OnlyFans Founder Among Latest TikTok Bidders

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor As the deadline nears for TikTok‘s Chinese parent to cut a deal to divest controlling ownership of the app or face a U.S. ban, new bidders are coming out of the woodwork. Among the interested investors in TikTok is Tim Stokely, founder of OnlyFans — the opt-in social media platform known for hosting sexually explicit content. Stokely, who founded OnlyFans in 2016, left the company in 2021. Stokely’s new social media startup Zoop, which says it “rewards both creators and their community members for their engagement,” teamed with the Hbar Foundation, which manages the Hedera cryptocurrency network, on a joint bid for TikTok, per Reuters. Popular on Variety Related Stories VIP+ Sports Rights: Streamers vs. TV Networks – A Special Report AT&T Has the Best Deals on Samsung Mobile Devices and Accessories In addition, Amazon submitted a last-minute offer to buy TikTok in an offer letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the New York Times reported. However, the newspaper reported, various parties “who have been involved in the talks do not appear to be taking Amazon’s bid seriously. Oracle and private-equity firm Blackrock also have reportedly been in talks about a deal to take an ownership stake in TikTok. Others that have come forward with bids include former L.A. Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, mobile-technology vendor AppLovin and AI company Perplexity. VIP+ Analysis: Meet the TikTok Rival That Gained Most From U.S. Ban – and It’s Not RedNote The value of the Zoop-led bid, which was made in conjunction with other unidentified partners, was not disclosed. Zoop co-founder RJ Phillips told Reuters, “Our bid for TikTok isn’t just about changing ownership, it’s about creating a new paradigm where both creators and their communities benefit directly from the value they generate.” President Trump was reported to be meeting with advisers Wednesday to consider next steps for TikTok. Trump set an April 5 deadline for ByteDance to either sell its controlling interest in TikTok or face a U.S. ban on national security grounds under a U.S. law that took effect Jan. 19. Supporters of the TikTok divest-or-ban law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, have said Trump’s 75-day enforcement delay did not have legal basis.

Title: Greenlane and Volvo’s bold plan to transform electric truck charging in the US

Time Published: 2025-04-02T19:30:46Z

Greenlane is teaming up with Volvo Trucks North America to make charging heavy-duty electric vehicles (HDEVs) easier and more accessible. The charging network developer is now integrated into Volvo’s Open Charge service, which gives Volvo customers streamlined access to Greenlane’s public chargers. This collaboration makes Greenlane the first official Charge Point Operator (CPO) in North America to partner with Volvo. Greenlane is a joint venture between Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy, and BlackRock. It’s building a US-wide charging network for heavy-duty commercial vehicles, aiming to reduce costs and simplify switching to electric fleets. Through Volvo Open Charge, Volvo customers now have real-time access to Greenlane’s network, which means easier access to public charging, centralized billing, and special perks. Fleets won’t have to spend big money on their charging infrastructure. Instead, they can plug into Greenlane’s growing network, which will help cut costs and operational headaches while extending range. Patrick Macdonald-King, Greenlane’s CEO, called the partnership “a first-of-its-kind collaboration to deliver public charging solutions tailored to the needs of medium- and heavy-duty fleets.” He said it’s all about making the shift to electric trucks smoother and keeping goods and services moving while progressing toward zero-emissions freight. Greenlane’s flagship charging site is set to open in Colton, California, in April, with more than 40 publicly accessible chargers for everything from heavy-duty trucks to smaller electric vehicles. It’s part of a larger plan to build a network along the I-15 corridor, with stations roughly 60 to 90 miles apart. Future California locations are planned for Long Beach, Barstow, and Baker. Greenlane and Volvo will continue integrating new membership features into Volvo Open Charge, such as booking reservations. By letting fleets tap into an existing public network, Greenlane’s services can make the transition to electric trucking less about building infrastructure and more about just getting trucks on the road.

The metric, which tracks the rate of Ethereum removed from circulation, recently hit its lowest level since August 2021, a nagging concern among investors that’s “weighed on Ethereum’s market performance,” according to the crypto market maker Wintermute. Last week, around 53 ETH was burned per day, the firm said. Meanwhile, ETH’s supply has increased 3% since an upgrade called EIP-1559 took effect, according to Ultrasound Money. The lower burn rate underscores how ETH’s ability to accrue value has shifted since developers embraced layer-2 scaling solutions a year ago. Since then, Ethereum’s so-called issuance has been net positive, yet some experts believe institutional adoption trends could change that. During the first quarter, ETH’s price plummeted 45%, wiping away $170 billion in market value, according to crypto data providers CoinGecko and CoinGlass. That represented the third worst quarter for ETH going as far back as 2016. Years ago, user activity on Ethereum became a core driver of ETH’s value, when Ethereum developers implemented a fee-burning mechanism called EIP-1559 in August 2021. While Ethereum’s users previously paid transaction fees to miners, the network started burning them instead, reducing the asset’s circulating supply in relation to network activity. When Ethereum later transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model in 2022, making miners obsolete and vastly reducing the network’s carbon footprint, the rate at which new ETH is issued was also reduced. Together, the upgrades made Ethereum’s circulating supply deflationary. EIP-4844, an upgrade that significantly reduced the amount of ETH burned by layer-2 networks, changed that dynamic. As user activity has gravitated toward those scaling solutions, transaction fees have fallen on Ethereum too, recently hitting a five-year low of $0.40. During the pandemic-era crypto boom, so-called gas wars plagued Ethereum users, who sometimes paid upwards of $4,000 for a single transaction. NFT projects were a common yet ultimately beneficial source of congestion, like those tied to Bored Ape Yacht Club. Tokenize Everything As Wall Street starts migrating on-chain, some analysts believe that ETH could become deflationary again, if institutions end up bringing trillions of dollars of assets with them. The process of taking real-world assets, such as stocks and bonds, and representing them on-chain as digital tokens is referred to as tokenization. In a letter to shareholders, Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, mentioned the term a dozen times. “One day, I expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as ETFs,” Fink wrote. “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized.” Excluding Ethereum’s layer-2 networks, $5 billion worth of real-world assets have been tokenized on Ethereum, accounting for 54% of the market, according to RWA.xyz. The measure excludes stablecoins, which are often backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries. That sum could broadly grow to $16 trillion by 2030, according to a paper published by Boston Consulting Group in October, but estimates from experts vary widely. “We're not seeing the economic benefits from tokenization yet,” Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. “This is going to take longer than people want it to because these large asset managers don't move very quickly.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Futarchy For Fundraising
URL: https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/futarchy-for-fundraising
Time Published: 2025-04-02T19:17:12Z
Full Content:
The Making of Modern Corporate Finance: A History of the Ideas and How They Help Build the Wealth of Nations (quotes below), by Donald Chew, persuaded me that for-profit-firm capitalism has varied quite a lot over space and time, and that the U.S. still has a big lead. Private equity works best, though it still only controls ~10% as much capital as public firms. Academics and other elites don’t report much on this story, as improvements usually defied their advice and pressures. The fact that hostile takeovers are widely hindered also tells me that we still have lots of room for improvement. Which raises my hopes that futarchy might also be allowed to help. Most CEOs are not at all eager for futarchy to advise on the decisions they feel they “own”. But it should be easier to get CEO support for futarchy advising decisions that they often cannot make on their own, but must instead make together with boards and investors. For example, futarchy could advise whether to keep or dump the CEO. Another promising application is decisions on when and how to raise more capital. The book says that when CEOs initiate a sale of more stock, stock prices fall by 2-3%, as investors fear secret CEO info on firm money problems, or that the stock price is currently too high. While board approval is usually required for such sales, that doesn’t prevent this problem. However when shareholder votes must also approve such stock sales, prices instead rise. The same pattern holds for mergers and acquisitions done with or without shareholder approval. Similarly, stocks rise 6-7% when activist investors buy blocks of stocks, intending to make governance proposals to be approved by shareholder votes. Thus there are many identifiable types of firm governance decisions where investors are right to be skeptical about CEO proposals, even when they are supported by boards. Requiring shareholder votes to approve those proposals is one kind of check, but instead requiring futarchy approval, or at least the lack of a futarchy veto, seems to me a faster cheaper better-informed alternative process. Great firm value may be unleashed via creating futarchy systems for such decisions. Those book quotes: Corporate conglomerates had been “allowed to destroy 50% for more of the operating value of their franchises” before outside investors became willing and able to raise the funding to intervene.(p.xiv) Stock prices do indeed fall - by 2-3% on average - upon seasoned equity offering announcements. … But why do they fall? Stew’s explanation … focuses on the infraction disadvantage of outside investors vis-a-vis managers or other insiders about matters like to affect the value of the firm. … * The plan to raise any capital - debt or equity - increases the possibility, and investors’ suspicions, that the company is seeking new capital mainly just to make up for an unexpected shortfall in earnings for cash flows, and not to fund necessary or promising investment. * Investors view managements and seeking to raise equality opportunistically - that is, when they think the company’s shares are overvalued - and to avoid issuing new shares when the company is undervalued, since this would effectively transfer value from the old shareholders to any new shareholders who take up the offering. (p.95) Data … about the operating performance of U.S. companies with at least $50 million in sales that were bought by US. buyout firms during the period 1981-1986 … For the 76 “round trip” deals (management buyouts of public companies that went public again through IPOs) in his sample, the operating gains resulted init increases enterprise value (debt plus equity) of roughly 100%. … Little evidence of a decline in employment levels or averse wage rates of blue collar workers after LBOs. (p.129) For the 29 public equity (PE) vintage years from 1986 through 2014, PE firms produced for their LPs an impressive average “direct alpha” or above market return of almost 500 basis points … reported an annual average value-weighted excess return of 3.5%. (p.134) Recent estimates … private equity owned U.S. companies … have attained a total market cap roughly equivalent to 10% of the total market cap of U.S. public companies. (p.143) Remarkable “meta study” of over 100 studies of the market reactions to announcements of the three main kinds of seasoned stock offerings - public offers, rights offers and private placements - by public companies in 23 different countries. What Holderness finds is an astonishingly simple, and consistent, empirical regularity. When shareholders are required to approve new stock issues, the average stock returns to announcements of seasoned stock offerings by public companies are positive - on the order of 2% (and highly statistically significant). But when managers issue stock without shareholder approvals, as we have already seen in the case of U.S. public offerings, the returns are significant negative - a percent to -3%, on average. … Strikingly consistent positive market responses to announcements of large acquisitions by UK companies that require shareholder approval … in sharp contrast to the zero or negative average announcement returns for the transactions not subject to a shareholder vote. … U.S. M&A markets - where even the largest deals can easily be (and typically are) structured to avoid shareholder votes … the larger U.S. deals provide returns to shareholders that were significantly negative, on average. (p.148) Longer-run effects of some 1,740 separate “engagements” of public companies by 330 different hedge funds operating in 23 countries during the period 2000-2010. Like many other studies of activists this one starts by confirming the market’s initial enthusiasm about activists block purchases and proposals. But the initial positive returns (of round 6-7% on almost all countries) are maintained only when the engagements lead to “events” with consequences - outcomes like increases in payouts, board replacements, or restructurings. In such cases the initial returns end up significantly higher than 6%. … the incidence and probability of activist engagements are greatest in in companies and countries with large proportions of institutional investors, particular when the investors happen to be based in the U.S. (p.149) To me, private equity seems like the opposite direction as futarchy. The point of private equity is that all the transparency, crowd input, and rules around being a publicly listed company can be detrimental, and you can do better if you just take the whole thing private for a while. Whereas futarchy is this idea of applying even more transparency and rules for crowd input to the operation of a company. Again you're conflating CEO ownership (where the CEO might be expected to have insider information about the company) with ownership by a separate private equity firm, which would be expected to have no more information about the company than any other activist investor. I'm skeptical about some of these figures. What's actually being measured for the "excess return"? Most private equity firms are not buying out publicly traded companies, so you can't compare stock prices before and after. They're buying out small privately owned companies - probably taking advantage of the owners' ignorant undervaluation of their own company. They're competing with the prior owners, not the market at large. If, when a private equity firm buys out a public company, it achieves a value-weighted annual excess return of 3.5%, why don't they already control most of the capital in the nation, instead of just 10%? > But the initial positive returns (of round 6-7% on almost all countries) are maintained only when the engagements lead to “events” with consequences - outcomes like increases in payouts, board replacements, or restructurings. To me this smells like subgroup analysis. There are positive returns... but only when we restrict the sample by some ill-defined post-hoc criteria. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Wall Street Giant DTCC Unveils Tokenized Collateral Platform in Crypto Push

The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system, is pushing deeper into crypto with introducing a blockchain-based platform for tokenized collateral management. Collateral is a fundamental part of risk management in financial markets, ensuring stability amid market fluctuations. However, traditional systems often suffer from inefficiencies due to fragmented infrastructure and lagging settlements. DTCC said its new platform seeks to address these challenges by tokenizing collateral on blockchain rails, allowing for real-time transfers and automation through smart contracts, according to a Wednesday press release. The platform runs within DTCC’s AppChain ecosystem, which was developed on top of LF Decentralized Trust’s Besu blockchain. Read more: Why Asset Tokenization Is Inevitable "Collateral mobility is the ‘killer app’ for institutional use of blockchain," Dan Doney, chief technology officer of DTCC Digital Assets, said in a statement. "By using smart contracts to automate the full range of collateral operations, we enable complex trade execution across markets in real-time at any time, even in volatile conditions." "This platform is unique in that we’ve created something that’s more open, flexible, dynamic, and comprehensive than any previous digital collateral initiative," said Nadine Chakar, global head of DTCC Digital Assets. The initiative comes as tokenization of traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and other traditional investments has become one of the hottest use cases for blockchain technology. Multiple financial heavyweights like BlackRock, CME Group and Fidelity have thrown their hat in the ring pursuing benefits such as operational efficiencies, speedier settlements and increased transparency compared to using traditional financial plumbing. DTCC will showcase the platform’s capabilities at the "The Great Collateral Experiment" event on April 23, where industry participants will test how tokenized assets can be mobilized across markets. The company said it also plans to engage with regulators and industry leaders to establish global standards for tokenized collateral.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Could See $3B in Q2 Inflows Even Without Price Recovery, Says Analyst
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/02/bitcoin-etfs-could-see-usd3b-in-q2-inflows-even-without-price-recovery-says-analyst
Time Published: 2025-04-02T15:55:25Z
Full Content:
The spot bitcoin ETFs saw sizable inflows in the first quarter despite the lame price action and at least one analyst sees the next three months as even bigger even if the prices don't recover. “Even if current market conditions persist in the second quarter, we are seeing strong traction from financial advisors and institutional investors," said Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise (whose BITB is among the bitcoin ETFs). "While retail interest is weak due to the fixation on price action, professional investors are recognizing the global adoption momentum spurred by the Trump administration’s embrace of bitcoin, and many are seeing these market conditions as an opportunity to start or increase an allocation," Leon added. The ETFs saw over $1 billion in inflows in the first quarter of the year despite a challenging macro situation that sent the S&P 500 Index into its biggest quarterly loss since 2022 and bitcoin's 13% plunge. Leon expects inflows to be even stronger in the second quarter — as much as $3 billion or even more as wirehouse platforms unlock and legislative policy progresses. ETF inflows possibly less than meets the eye The $1 billion in first quarter net flows — and whatever the second quarter brings — doesn't necessarily reflect investor interest in buying the bitcoin dip. That's because of the so-called basis trade (also known as cash-and-carry). In this, institutional players buy the spot bitcoin ETF while shorting CME bitcoin futures, picking up yield without exposure to price movement. That yield was well into the double-digits in late 2024 and remained nicely above the risk-free rate throughout much of the first quarter. It's collapsed to the 5% area of late, suggesting arbitrage-related ETF inflows may dry up. Back to bull case: It's still early “While a favorable price environment would certainly be a boost, it's important to remember that adoption of spot bitcoin ETFs by these groups is still in its infancy," said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, who is also bullish on the outlook for inflows throughout the rest of the year.. "As they grow more comfortable allocating to bitcoin, this should provide a meaningful tailwind for inflows,” he added.., While many institutions have indeed already made their first allocations into bitcoin in the past year, it represents only a small fraction of ETF investment, with most of the money still coming from retail investors — something recently noted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, whose IBIT is the asset-gathering leader among the spot ETFs. The more favorable regulatory stance toward the industry, not to mention the government’s own potential allocation into bitcoin, however, means that ratio could soon shift significantly. During an ETF conference in Las Vegas earlier this month, a survey showed that 57% of advisors plan on increasing their allocations into crypto ETFs this year as crypto has lost its “reputational risk” attribute among advisors. The view that bitcoin could serve as a “safe haven” in times of an economic decline, which investors remain anxious about, could also boost confidence in the asset, especially as fears of a potential recession grow. “If we see continued rate cut expectations, signs of economic uncertainty, or deepening fears of a potential recession in the US, Bitcoin’s role as 'digital gold' will likely support additional inflows,” said David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets. “While some short-term traders may rotate out if price weakness persists, long-term players will continue to keep inflows strong, especially as institutional adoption takes off and drives demand throughout the year."

April 02, 2025 11:35 ET | Source: Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses In Rocket Lab To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in Rocket Lab between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). [You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Rocket Lab USA class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/RKLB or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Timeline to COVID Tyranny – The Year 2019 and the Coming Storm
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/timeline-covid-tyranny-year-2019-coming-storm/5883286
Time Published: 2025-04-02T15:30:32Z
Full Content:
Appreciating the full impact of the covid “shock and awe” campaign requires an understanding of not only the extensive planning that went into constructing the massive pandemic machine but also an awareness of how today’s healthcare management systems are being exploited to funnel trillions of dollars into the coffers of the world’s banker barons, pharmaceutical industry, and global ruling elites. We should not underestimate the windfall that has accrued to financial institutions (publicly traded and private banks, brokerage houses, investment firms, wealthy individuals, and family dynasties) from the healthcare sector of the securities markets. In the US alone, national health expenditures (NHE) — that is, total spending on healthcare and related activities — constitute the largest sector of the US economy. Last year, NHE was more than $5 trillion, or 17.7% of the US gross domestic product (GDP). By 2032, NHE are projected to rise to $7.7 trillion, or 19.7% of GDP. In other words, “disease” has replaced war as the primary money-spinner of the US — and the globe. The titans who control the nation’s politicians and the economy’s purse strings, including the details and direction of monetary and fiscal policy, need to create lengthy, large-scale health crises in order to keep their drowning-in-red-ink financial systems afloat. Manufactured pandemics have become mammoth investment opportunities that increase the wealth of these billionaires and further consolidate their power. The covid phenomenon itself cannot be fully comprehended without understanding the behind-the-scenes, un-televised, unprecedented economic collapse of 2019–2020 that threatened the entire global financial system. In the words of David A. Hughes, author of COVID-19 — Psychological Operations and the War for Technocracy, “This was not to be just any recession, however. This was, potentially, to be a system-destroying recession.” In September 2019, world markets were faced with an emergency debt crisis that popped up in formerly (mostly) liquid markets — namely, money markets, repurchase agreement (repo) markets, and foreign exchange (FX) markets. A crisis in the US repo market saw the secured overnight lending rate briefly hit 10% (versus its prior 2019 rate of 2%–3%), prompting the Federal Reserve to step in and begin dumping hundreds of billions of dollars a week into Wall Street’s trading firms. That repo loan operation, effectively a Wall Street bailout program, started September 17 and over the next six months came to more than $9 trillion in cumulative loans made at super-cheap borrowing rates. John Titus, a lawyer by training who, ever since the pandemic, has been applying his forensic skills to rooting out banking fraud, suggests that the Federal Reserve loan activity led to the decision to put BlackRock’s “Dealing with the next downturn” plan into action. Curiously, that white paper, whose central tenet is the “going direct” plan, was written by four BlackRock investment officers even before the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared the pandemic in March 2020. All of this suggests that the covid crisis was timed to coincide with the emergency debt crisis the world markets were facing. It looks like Western governments, at the beck and call of the big banks, instigated an operation to stem the cataclysmic economic landslide, bail out large investors, and proactively install a security infrastructure to control the inevitable social disorder that would result from this global catastrophe. Put another way, without an external threat like a “killer virus,” without the Covid-19 smokescreen, this massive financial collapse and historic wealth transfer would be seen for what it was: colossal theft by the ruling aristocracy of financial fraudsters. As I wrote in my January 2, 2023, article for Off-Guardian, “That’s the coup: global hyperinflation to vaporize the assets of the masses and the states in order to hand over public assets to private investors. This allows the ruling class to mop up properties (bankrupted small businesses, foreclosed homes, etc.) in order to stake limitless claims on everything in the world.” And, as John Titus wrote in his Summary — Going Direct Reset: “In a nutshell, the arrival of the 2020 pandemic was about as accidental as an assassination. The pandemic narrative is nothing but a cover story to conceal from the public what in reality is the biggest asset transfer ever.” Click here to read the timeline. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Novo Holdings' earnings nearly doubled in 2024, despite Novo Nordisk's stock slump

Time Published: 2025-04-02T15:13:00Z

Novo Holdings, the controlling shareholder of Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.38%), nearly doubled its annual income and investment returns in 2024. The life sciences–focused holding company reported Wednesday that its total income and investment returns reached a record 60 billion Danish krone ($8.7 billion), a 92% jump from 31.2 billion krone ($4.5 billion) the previous year. “2024 was a successful year for Novo Holdings, not only in terms of financial performance, but also in strengthening our organization with the addition of talented new colleagues,” CEO Kasim Kutay said in a press release. “In 2025, we will build on this momentum, with a particular focus on Asia as we establish an office in India.” Novo Holdings manages the assets of the Novo Nordisk Foundation and holds a controlling stake in Novo Nordisk, with 77% of voting shares. The Danish pharma company’s revenue surged 26% last year to $40.5 billion, helping drive Novo Holdings’ financial gains. The holding company expanded its portfolio slightly in 2024, adding 43 new companies while exiting 27. By year’s end, its portfolio comprised 181 companies. The company’s largest acquisition last year was the drug manufacturer Catalent. As part of the $16.5 billion deal, Novo Holdings agreed to acquire Catalent, while Novo Nordisk purchased three of its manufacturing facilities. The move aimed to ease supply shortages at the time of the company’s weight loss drug Wegovy. Novo Nordisk said the acquisition would boost production capacity starting in 2026. Catalent manufactures nearly 70 billion doses of more than 7,000 products each year. Despite Novo Holdings’ strong financial performance, the company saw its total assets under management shrink to $153 billion from $161 billion in 2023, reflecting a drop in Novo Nordisk’s market value. The pharma giant’s stock has fallen 46% over the past 12 months, weighed down by setbacks including clinical trials that failed to meet expectations.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Bitcoin could be a lifeline to US global dominance as US debt doubles China

Bitcoin's potential as a reserve currency gains traction amid U.S. financial challenges. The United States federal deficit is projected to reach $1.9 trillion in fiscal year 2025, approximately 2.4 times larger than China’s estimated 5.66 trillion yuan ($780 billion) shortfall. According to Reuters, the US Treasury recorded a $1.15 trillion deficit during the first five months of the fiscal year (Oct – Feb), marking a 38% year-over-year increase. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the full-year shortfall at 6.5% of GDP, significantly above the 50-year average of 3.8%, as entitlement costs and interest payments surge. Debt servicing alone reached $396 billion during the same five months, while federal revenue growth stagnated at around 1% year-on-year. In contrast, China’s Ministry of Finance has set its 2025 deficit target at 4% of GDP, the highest in over three decades. While the nominal figure is smaller, adjusted estimates from Fitch Ratings suggest China’s actual fiscal deficit may be closer to 8.8% of GDP when off-budget borrowing is included. The increase reflects a deliberate shift toward infrastructure investment, expanded subsidies, and efforts to offset the prolonged property market slowdown, as outlined in Beijing’s Government Work Report. The magnitude and trajectory of US debt growth have reignited debate over the dollar’s long-term viability as the world’s primary reserve currency. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently warned that escalating US deficits could erode global confidence in the dollar and open the door for alternative financial instruments, such as Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s decentralized structure and fixed supply have led some analysts to consider it a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Amid these concerns, the concept of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset has gained momentum in policy circles. Former President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a national Bitcoin reserve using assets seized from criminal cases, positioning digital assets as tools for bolstering fiscal resilience. However, adoption faces challenges. Bitcoin’s perceived price volatility and regulatory direction continue to raise concerns. The European Central Bank, for example, has dismissed the idea of including Bitcoin in its reserves, with President Christine Lagarde stating it will not happen during her tenure. As US debt accelerates beyond even China’s rising fiscal imbalance, discussions about reserve diversification, particularly involving Bitcoin, are likely to intensify. Advocates cite Bitcoin’s deflationary properties and independence from central banks, while the strength of critics’ arguments on its instability and unclear regulatory frameworks is decreasing. There is growing uncertainty around the future of global monetary policy, and the search for alternative safeguards against systemic fiscal risk may well lead to Bitcoin.

Title: From Double Fees to Misleading YouTube Claims: All the Ways Basant Maheshwari Firm Broke SEBI Rules
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/04/223-ways-basant-maheshwari-firm-broke-sebi-ia-rules/
Time Published: 2025-04-02T12:42:44Z
Full Content:
MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India We missed this earlier: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has imposed a monetary penalty of Rs 4 lakh on Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers LLP for violating SEBI’s 2013 Investment Adviser Regulations. The fine was levied after an inspection of Maheshwari’s firm from October to December 2023. For context, in India, only SEBI-registered investment advisers (IAs) can provide investment advice/recommendations, and they are required to meet certain basic criteria like defined educational qualifications, work experience, and a worth of Rs 5 lakh in assets to do so. To begin, SEBI deemed that the firm was charging 32 clients fees from both, the fixed fee method and the assets-under-advice (AuA) mode. This infringed Regulation 15A of SEBI’s guidelines, which stipulated that investment advisers can charge clients by only one mode on an annual basis, and any such change in mode shall take effect after 12 months of the onboarding or such indication. Notably, the company had previously claimed that the multiple advisory services it offers to clients fall within the ambit of SEBI’s guidelines that envisage such a situation. Besides this, the firm claimed to charge a quarter’s fee in advance to clients’ portfolios beset with AuA-based pricing in compliance with IA norms. However, SEBI argues that the process must contain certain guardrails, like informing clients about AuA details and maintaining records for the same. The firm also failed to conduct annual audits required for a portfolio manager (PM) as per SEBI’s guidelines. The market regulator stated that Maheshwari conducted the investment advisory business by exploiting its portfolio manager registration (instead of an IA registration) and utilising the exemption provided to PMs under the IA Regulations. Responding to SEBI’s observation, the company claimed to undertake risk profiling, suitability assessment, know-your-customer (KYC) check, signing advisory agreement, etc., as mandated by applicable advisory regulations while onboarding advisory clients. However, since the firm offered IA services as registered PMs, they claimed to undertake the internal audit of the portfolio management services (PMS) business in line with applicable PMS norms. Additionally, the firm will be conducting audits in accordance with IA regulations from the current fiscal year (FY 2024-25) onwards, noting that the company had just received its IA license. SEBI also accused Maheshwari of uploading videos with exaggerated captions on his YouTube channel. Examples of these captions include: “100X Portfolio- 3 Saal Mei? Kaise Kiya?“, “1 Crore Ko Double Kaise Kare?? Explained in 2 Minutes“, “10 Saal Mei 10 Guna Aur 20 Saal Mei 100 Guna!! Kaise Kare??“, etc. Notably, the firm contends that the videos are curated for educational purposes and “knowledge-sharing motives” among the general public instead of influencing investors to engage in the sale of stocks. In their response to the Board, the company also stated that Basant Maheshwari, in delivering insights/views on different securities, refrains from recommending any stock for its purchase or sale, thereby arguing that the videos don’t fall “within the ambit of advertisement.” Additionally, the firm argued that since the videos provide investor education, they aren’t liable to the advertisement code under the Finfluencer guidelines issued by the body. SEBI’s show cause notice “cherry-picks the titles of the videos and fails to appreciate the true meaning and import behind such videos,” the firm opined. Besides this, the company also mentions voluntarily adding the Standard Disclaimer Clause as per SEBI’s Circular in the description box of its YouTube channel. However, SEBI opined that Maheshwari provides a link to his smallcase website in the description box of the channel with the statement “Invest in our smallcase,” thereby influencing investors and constituting an advertisement. Further, concerning the standard disclaimer, SEBI contends that it hasn’t been listed explicitly and instead uploaded through a PDF link on the description. Finally, Maheshwari’s videos contravene SEBI’s advertising code, which bars statements inconsistent, exaggerated, or unrelated to the nature of the risk and return profile of the product. In addition to arguing against the previous claims made by SEBI, Maheshwari Wealth Advisers appealed against the imposition of any monetary penalty, citing the tarnishing of its reputation and “detrimental effect on the investor confidence”. Notably, while the firm initially filed to settle with matter, it later withdrew the application, allowing the proceedings to continue. Ultimately, the company was ordered to pay the penalty within 45 days of the receipt of the order, failing which SEBI may initiate “consequential actions” against it, including undertaking recovery proceedings via the attachment and sale of movable and immovable properties. This judgement comes amid the market regulator tightening its vigil on unregistered financial influencers (or finfluencers). To explain, in the past year, SEBI directed all regulated entities (REs) to terminate existing contracts with unregistered individuals providing advice on securities without its permission, except if the individuals are associated through a “specified digital platform.” This mandate followed SEBI fining finfluencers like Baap of Chart and PR Sundar Rs 17.2 crore and Rs 6 crore, respectively for providing investment advice without registering with the Board. In January 2025, SEBI further restricted market entities from engaging with finfluencers and forbade educators from using the market price data of the preceding three months or the code name of any security while sharing their content. Later, the Board issued an advisory mandating verification for REs uploading advertisements on social media platforms. As per SEBI’s directions, such entities must sign up on social media platforms using their SEBI-registered email IDs and mobile numbers, following which they would be scrutinised under advertiser verification by platforms like Meta and Google. This action followed SEBI alongside social media platforms, removing 70,000 misleading posts and handles since October 2024. Coming back to the judgement, SEBI reaffirms and explicitly notes that the advertisement code applies to any form of communication issued by investment advisers (including on social media) that influences investment decisions. Further, in deeming the inadequacy of the disclaimer listed in the video description boxes, it directs the attention of investment advisers to properly and overtly making such mentions. Finally, as the regulator clamps down further on advertisements, finfluencers, and social media claims, it will be interesting to note how regulated entities adapt to the norms and how many enforcement actions the body takes.

Title: To Make Better Decisions, Think Like a Venture Capitalist

A conversation with Stanford GSB professor Ilya Strebulaev on embracing disagreement. Venture capital firms notoriously embrace risk and take big swings, hoping that one startup will become a monster hit that pays for many other failed investments. This VC approach scares established companies, but it shouldn’t. Stanford Graduate School of Business professor Ilya Strebulaev says that VC firms have proven best practices that all leaders should apply in their own companies. He explains exactly how VC’s operationalize risk, embrace disagreement over consensus, and stay agile in their decision-making—all valuable lessons that apply outside of Silicon Valley. With author Alex Dang, Strebulaev cowrote the new book The Venture Mindset: How to Make Smarter Bets and Achieve Extraordinary Growth and the HBR article “Make Decisions with a VC Mindset.” Key episode topics include: HBR On Strategy curates the best case studies and conversations with the world’s top business and management experts, to help you unlock new ways of doing business. New episodes every week. HANNAH BATES: Welcome to HBR On Strategy—case studies and conversations with the world’s top business and management experts, hand-selected to help you unlock new ways of doing business. Is your company slow to make decisions? Afraid of failure, maybe to a fault? A risk-averse mindset can thwart a company’s growth and competitiveness. Stanford Graduate Business School professor Ilya Strebulaev says the antidote is for senior leaders to start thinking like venture capitalists. He talked to Curt Nickisch on HBR IdeaCast in 2024 about what the “venture capitalist mindset” is, and what it can do for businesses. CURT NICKISCH: So let’s dig into the VC mindset and what sets these decision makers apart. One thing that probably anybody would tell you if you ask them on the street is that this willingness to fail, comfort with failure is sort of at the heart of that mindset. Does your research bear that out? ILYA STREBULAEV: It does. Of course, willingness to fail is one of the many principles that we identified that constitute the venture mindset. In fact, the way I think about failure is in terms of baseball. For venture capitalists, home runs matter, and strikeouts don’t. What you’ll see is that out of 20 typical early-stage venture capital investments, most may fail. A few will maybe return the money back, and maybe will earn a little bit. And it’s only one out of 20 that becomes a home run. In one of my venture capital classes at Stanford, we had one quite famous venture capitalist. And he was talking about one of his venture funds that he started back in 1999. And many, many years later, that fund was still going. All of his companies but one failed from that fund. And when students asked that venture capitalist, “So that fund was unsuccessful, right?” And his reply was, “Not at all, because there is still one company that actually is doing very, very well.” And so that company might become a home run. It’s easy to say, “Let’s embrace failure.” It’s much more difficult to implement it in a practical way. So we can think about specific, what we called playbook mechanisms, of how you can implement every single principle of the VC mindset, including how you can implement your approach to failure, so that indeed you concentrate on home runs, and you decide to let go of your strikeouts. CURT NICKISCH: Before we get into that playbook, let’s just talk about this game strategy first. And that is that you’re swinging for the fences, to use the baseball analogy of hitting a home run. That’s an economic model that works, but is it wrong for companies to say, “Let’s try 10 things, and it’s okay if only five of them are moderately successful.” But they’re not. None of them are big hits. ILYA STREBULAEV: The way to think about this principle of home runs met and strikeouts don’t, is not to think about each individual project or each individual experiment, but think about a portfolio of bets that you have. I think when smart venture capitalists make decisions about how they’re going to allocate their budget, very often the most important decision is not about a specific startup, but the most important decision about the portfolio allocation. My first reaction is let’s think about your strategy. Maybe you don’t take enough risk. So recently I worked with one venture fund that’s quite successful, or used to be quite successful. And the fund increased, almost tripled in size, and almost tripled in terms of the number of partners. And the managing partner realized that well, we’re not as successful as we used to be. So they invited me, and I looked at their data. And I quickly realized that their portfolio allocation strategy changed. They no longer made a lot of risky bets. Well, behind that was another principle of the venture mindset, which is agree to disagree. In that venture capital fund, they used to have three partners. Now they had eight or nine partners. And yet they continued exactly the same decision-making process they used to have 10, 15 years ago. And one of the important principles they had is that every single partner should be very enthusiastic about the deal. And with let’s say nine partners, it no longer works. That means that all nine partners must now consent to invest in the deal. And one of the specific recommendations from me was, you have to change this consensus culture. You have to agree to disagree. By the way, there’s a specific playbook mechanism that I recommend, and not just for venture capitalists, but in fact for any organization. And it is called Anti-portfolio. And anti-portfolio means look at the projects that you decided not to implement, and have a look at what happened to those projects. And if your anti-portfolio performs better than your portfolio, I think there’s a good reason to sit back and think what happened. And in a large organization, it’s very similar. You have a lot of internal projects that you then decide maybe not to pursue. Well, have a look what happened to similar projects or similar ideas elsewhere. CURT NICKISCH: So let’s dig into one thing that you just talked about a bit, which was this agree to disagree, which goes against a lot of companies that are consensus driven. And it goes against just this idea, I guess, that if it’s a good idea, everybody should recognize it and come around to it. But if you really try to go with consensus, then you tend to not have very pathbreaking, groundbreaking investments or ventures that you’re developing inside your firm. Is that right? ILYA STREBULAEV: That is right, Curt. I think consensus is very important in the era of stability so that when we all know the final goal, we all have more or less the same information, and none of us expect dramatic changes, then consensus is likely the right approach. But once we face what I call unknown unknowns, once in fact the end goal is unclear. For example, maybe we’re entering the new market. For example, we are trying to adopt a new technology, then consensus is dangerous. CURT NICKISCH: I’m curious what specific things venture capital firms do then to get around this inertia, I guess, of consensus. What do they do to actually support that kind of disagreement and that kind of environment where disagreement can thrive and still let people proceed? ILYA STREBULAEV: They use several very practical mechanisms. The first one is they assign a devil’s advocate. You kind of appoint one person or a small group of people to take the opposite view. In fact, in a group decision making, it’s very often difficult for people to say, “I disagree.” Especially if somebody else is very enthusiastic about the deal, or maybe if the boss is enthusiastic about the investment. So you appoint somebody, and let’s say I’m going to say, “Curt, tomorrow we’re going to discuss this specific project. And it is your responsibility to come up with all possible weaknesses, all possible reasons why we should not pursue this project.” For example, Andreessen Horowitz, a large venture capital firm, also known as A16z very often designates what they call a red team. So they have a blue team that argues for the deal, and they have a red team tasked with arguing against a deal. Now in large organizations, they decide to implement a devil’s advocate, make sure that you alternate who the devil is. If you are going to be appointed as a devil again and again and again, then in fact your influence is going to be diminished over time. Another mechanism that venture capital firms use is what I call a consensus minus X rule. So let’s say going back to the example I gave earlier about a partnership of nine decision makers. Consensus minus X, let’s say consensus minus two means is that the investment will be approved even if only seven people are in favor. So you can set this number depending on the size of the investment. CURT NICKISCH: And so you might even make it smaller than for smaller investments, so that even if one person was in favor of doing it, you could do a seed stage investment, for instance. ILYA STREBULAEV: That is true. That is correct. And in fact, it’s not just about seed investment. Let me give you an example. Venrock, which is a very storied venture capital firm, the firm behind investments in Intel, Apple DoubleClick and many, many other companies. There are a number of partners, and they vigorously debate every deal. And then the partner who initially presented the idea, who is the pioneer of the idea, will have to make the final decision unilaterally. Think about this Curt. There are nine partners, and one partner will hear all the feedback. In fact, you’re facing now eight devils. And then you will have to make your own decision. CURT NICKISCH: I’m going to mention just a couple of other things that I thought were noteworthy in your article about improving this decision-making process. Number one, a lot of VC partnerships try to keep the team small, right? You just improve communication, you improve the speed, and that adding a lot of people to the decision-making process doesn’t actually help you that much. They ask for feedback in advance, some of them, so that people can read up on the companies, see the decks ahead of time, and then weigh in with their thoughts before they discuss as a group. And they also allow junior members of the team to speak first, just so that when the boss speaks, it doesn’t bias people’s opinions or influence the real feedback that they wanted to give. Some of those maybe are good practices that people know about, but I guess it’s important to underline, right? ILYA STREBULAEV: These practices might be well known. It doesn’t mean though that they’re frequently implemented in large organizations. You mentioned keep teams small. In all venture capital firms, teams are always kept very, very small. But in large companies, very often you go into a meeting room and there will be a lot of people. And sometimes you might ask, “What on earth are all these people doing here?” In practical terms, think about the following rule that is implemented in Amazon. Now, Amazon is one of those venture-backed company that retained it’s a venture mindset. Amazon has a very simple rule, two pizza team, so that if you’re still getting hungry after you consume two pizzas, then the team is too large, it’s around eight or ten people. And I think that there is in fact a lot of research that supports this notion. In fact, there’s a lot of research suggesting that maybe the teams should be even smaller. But in a large organization, every single time your decision-making team is more than ten, you have to ask a question why? And most often that will not be an efficient decision. Now, you also mentioned asking for feedback in advance. And in most successful venture capital firms, I observed that. And by the way, it is done for a number of reasons. One is because they would like to minimize the influence of authority. Because Curt, if you’re my boss, let’s say you are the senior managing partner of the venture capital firm, and I’m a junior. And I maybe know something very interesting about this startup or about the founder. I have some really value-add soft information. If you speak before me, then it’s very difficult for me to provide this information if it somehow disagrees with your assessment. CURT NICKISCH: Yeah, it becomes you like you’re arguing with that person. ILYA STREBULAEV: That’s right. In fact, where large organizations I think can and should use it is not just when they decide on investments or on projects, but also in the interview process in hiring decisions. Google, again, another venture-backed company that retained its venture mindset has a policy. There is an interview committee when you hire people. The policy is you ask members of those committees to record their comments on each candidate individually in advance of the meeting, so that when you meet, you can have a look at what every single committee member independently said. By the way, sometimes venture capital firms go even further. They request anonymity. And there is something else, which in my experience I find very counterintuitive for let’s say corporate leaders, is that if we have an expert in the room, the natural tendency is to ask the expert first. I’m sure you’ve been Curt, in the meetings where people said, “Well, Curt is the expert, so let’s hear from him what he has to say on this topic.” Venture capitalists very often do exactly the opposite. They’ll say, “Curt is the expert on this specific technology or this specific space. You know what? He is going to speak last.” Because well, you are the subject matter expert Curt, which means that if you say something and I happen to disagree with you, it’ll be much more difficult for me to talk. CURT NICKISCH: Yeah, so much of decision-making in organizations is often about repeating past performance, right? Finding previous patterns and trying to repeat them. It sounds like you’re saying the venture mindset is almost trying to divorce yourself from that, and be open to exceptions, and be open to what’s different and what’s new. ILYA STREBULAEV: In the large organization that deals with innovative projects, you always have to think about designing an efficient portfolio allocation. And try to avoid making an individual micro decisions on every single investment. So in the corporate VC environment, I think the parent company executives should decide on the total budget. They should decide on the number of investments that can be made. They should overall impose criteria, what kind of startups you can invest in, what kind of startups you can’t invest in. That depends on the overall strategy of the firm. But my advice is try to avoid making individual decisions. CURT NICKISCH: The other tip that you have in the article is just to set ambitious timelines. And one thing I hadn’t really understood is that a lot of venture capitalists know that these are highly uncertain deals. You really don’t know how these are going to turn out. In all likelihood, most of these are going to fail. So spending a lot of time thinking about it, trying to game it, and all these different scenarios, it doesn’t actually help you reduce the risk. You just have to make a decision and move on. And so that’s a big recommendation of yours is just to set ambitious timelines, make decisions quickly on these companies that come to you or these investment opportunities, and just move on and not overthink things. ILYA STREBULAEV: Curt, it is my recommendation. But note that I’m not saying that because you have to make decisions quickly, your decisions are going to be inefficient. In fact, venture capitalists came up with ways to make fast decisions very efficiently. And the chapter is titled How to Say No 100 Times. We do say it 100 times, because my research shows that for every startup that venture capital firms invest in, on average they say no, so they turn down 100 opportunities. Just think about this, think about all those thousands of startup investments that they decide not to invest in. And they do it quite efficiently. So very quickly how they do it, is that the venture mindset thinks about the funnel of all the deals in two different ways. The first, at the top of the funnel, you have a lot of deals. And I think of this as 100 to 10, using the automobile terminology, you are going to use a fast lane, which means that you are trying to make a very fast decision here as efficiently as possible. And here is one specific trick that venture capitalists use that I found amazingly efficient, and in all my work with large organizations, I observed that they don’t use this trick typically, before I explain this to them. They ask a different type of question. The typical question that you would ask Curt is, “Okay, here’s an investment. Why we would like to proceed with this investment?” But in the fast lane, 100 to 10 lane, venture capitalists ask a different question. They ask, “Why we should not proceed with this investment?” And just by adding not, it completely changes the picture. So that as long as you find a red flag or a critical flaw, you decide not to proceed with this deal and just move on to another investment. But once you go into what I call a slow lane or 10 to 1 lane, you switch. And venture capitalists very often subconsciously, they in fact, they don’t realize themselves. They switch from asking one question, why we should not invest, to asking another question, which is why we should invest. Or in fact, as one of my VC friends told me, “Why are we greedy to invest?” And then they proceed into relatively slow, still fast, but relatively slow due diligence. And I think that in large organizations you can really implement that approach, 100 to 10, 10 to 1, fast lane, slow lane. And so that the questions you are asking or ask your team to investigate are going to be different at the different levels of the deal or project funnel. CURT NICKISCH: Ilya, I want to ask you something about taking on this VC mindset at companies, because it’s different for them, right? Venture capitalists in some ways have it easy, because they’re not employing those people that are doing this. When those companies fail, they’ve lost their money, but they don’t have to pay severance. Often at companies, when you’re deciding on an internal venture, there is opportunity costs. You’re taking some of your employees who aren’t going to be working on other things, and then performance engine, I guess, instead of innovation engine to keep running. Knowing that these decisions are a little more complex just because of the nature of their business. What do you tell them when they feel like it’s just harder, or I have these realities that I have to pay attention to, that just doesn’t seem to factor for a company that’s just investing in companies and doesn’t suffer the same externalities that a corporation does with its own employees? ILYA STREBULAEV: That’s a great question, Curt. First of all, we talked today about several principles of the venture mindset and specific mechanisms, specific ways to implement it. For large organizations specifically, I think you have to take a parsimonious view. In our book, the Venture Mindset, we in fact discussed nine principles. And what I observed especially for large organizations, is that all those principles are interconnected. So that you might want to, as a Chief Executive Officer, let’s say, or a leader in a large company, you would like to get acquainted with all of them to start with. Because I think that will give you a much fuller picture with how to deal with all those complexities. Another point to keep in mind is that if you change the culture of your organization so that people are incentivized both financially and non-financially to pursue home runs in projects, in project teams, then it’ll be much easier to reallocate teams within your company, so that if a project fails as many projects in a large company should fail, it does mean that there will be layoffs. It does mean that there will be severance or separation from workers. It means that your team members are going to be reallocated. And indeed, many large companies pursue this strategy quite successfully in various industries, not just in technological industries. So in a way, I think large organizations, and this might sound counterintuitive, but that is both my observations and outcome of my research. Large organizations in fact, could use the venture mindset more efficiently than venture capital firms. Exactly because, first, unlike venture capital firms, they have a lot of resources. They have the budget, they have the people. Also, unlike venture capital firms, in fact, they can control better what those internal startups, let’s say, those intrapreneurs are doing. So in fact, if you exercise just the right dose of control while at the same time allowing a lot of flexibility, in fact, I think the venture mindset in a large company can flourish much more than even in a venture capital firm. CURT NICKISCH: Ilya, this has been really, really interesting with a lot of great takeaways for companies to copy something that’s successful in an industry that we can all learn a lot from.

Title: 'Liberation Day' has arrived — and Americans are already feeling the pain

Good morning. Elon Musk funneled more than $12 million via his America PAC into swaying the pivotal Supreme Court race in Wisconsin. It wasn't enough. Susan Crawford, a liberal judge from Dane County, defeated Brad Schimel, a conservative judge from Waukesha County. In today's big story, "Liberation Day" has arrived — and Americans are already feeling the pain. What's on deck Markets: One corner of the market could become recession-resistant, thanks to Gen Z and millennials. Tech: Adobe is the latest tech giant to move away from its diversity hiring targets. Business: The same badge-scan strategy used in Tesla layoffs hit government workers. But first, the big day has arrived. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Today is US President Donald Trump's so-called "Liberation Day:" the day when he is set to unveil a range of sweeping tariffs on key trading partners. Trump wrote back in February that the US would feel "some pain" with tariffs, but "it will all be worth the price that must be paid." That pain is already here, BI's Ayelet Sheffey writes. Companies have warned of rising prices; markets have plunged; bad vibes are back. Trade experts have said companies might absorb some of the cost of the planned tariffs, but Americans are likely to see higher prices on goods like groceries and cars. (Read all the tariffs Trump has threatened to impose here). Trump has said that his plans would promote production in the US. In the meantime, the uncertainty is leaving markets, businesses, and Americans on edge. As one retiree who voted for Trump told BI: "I hope he knows what he's doing, but I'm not so sure." Options trades can offer a hint of how the stock market might react. According to options data tracked by equity derivative strategists at JPMorgan, the S&P 500 is projected to move as much as 1.6% in response to the tariff announcement. The Nasdaq 100 and Rusell 2000 could move 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively. The White House has sent contradicting policy signals, and it remains unclear how lenient or draconian the tariffs will be. The president told reporters on March 23 that he "may give a lot of countries a break." "I don't change. But the word flexibility is an important word," Trump said. All eyes will be on the announcement at 4 p.m. ET. 1. Newsmax cements its meme stock status after its IPO debut on Monday. The right-wing cable news channel saw its stock surge as much as 2,190% in two days, catapulting its market value to over $20 billion and launching the tiny investment bank that handled its IPO onto the map. But investors should be wary, Peter Kafka writes. 2. Trump's trade war isn't the only thing that's derailed the stock market. While anticipated tariffs have rattled the markets in recent weeks, weak consumer confidence and other factors have soured the mood among investors heading into Q2. 3. Gen Z and millennials are making the wellness industry recession-resistant. Young Americans spend more on health and wellness than other generations, Bank of America data shows — and that could protect the industry during a recession. The bank sees these three wellness stocks benefiting. 1. Another DEI program bites the dust. In a company all-hands, Adobe's chief people officer said the company is ending diversity hiring targets, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by BI. Adobe joins the likes of Meta and Google in slashing DEI efforts. 2. The traditional coding interview is at a crossroads. Many software engineers are increasingly expected to use AI on the job. However, as AI advances, cheating on coding tests is becoming more seamless — and it's raising new ethical questions for hiring managers. 3. Meta just lost a key AI leader. Head of AI research Joelle Pineau is leaving the company at the end of May. Her departure comes as Meta seeks to step up competition with its rivals, pouring as much as $65 billion into the space. 1. Trump's latest Ivy League target: Princeton. The Trump administration froze federal research grants at the university, for reasons Princeton's president said were "not yet clear." It follows similar actions the administration has taken against Harvard and Columbia over antisemitism allegations. 2. Elon Musk's firing playbook hits another federal agency. Employees at the Department of Health and Human Services showed up to work on Tuesday to try their luck at the door. If their badge worked, it meant they still had their job. If not, they were axed. HHS workers told BI there were long lines and tears as they learned their fate. 3. Think your way to a dream home. When Daryl Fairweather moved to a new city, she wanted to avoid making rash decisions in her homebuying process. She used her expertise in behavioral economics to dodge common — and costly — mistakes. Tesla reports Q1 vehicle delivery and production figures.

Title: The camo & Dendias, Pierre abolishes a tax office madness, the peacemaker Euripides, Albert & Elafonisos, the chaos of Korasidis

Hello, today the M.M will…be dressed in camo, as they say, since K.M will speak about the country’s new defense doctrine, flanked by his favorite minister, Nikos Dendias, who will describe in more detail the 12-year defense doctrine of the country. These more detailed aspects will be presented by the minister in the closed session of the relevant Parliamentary Committee. There will also be other topics such as the new organization of military service, military camps, procurement accompanied by Greek added value, etc. Finally, logic With an amendment coming to the Pierrakakis bill (on Capital Markets), the State will finally stop suing taxpayers who have regulated debts either through the provisions for 120 installments or for the 70 installments (pandemic). You may be wondering why the tax office takes you to court if you are paying your installments on time and receiving a tax clearance certificate whenever you request one. Well, because some legal genius who drafted the law did not foresee that the 120 or 70 installments extend beyond five years, thus creating a risk of statute of limitations for the State! So, what has the State been doing until now? Quite simply, one morning, while you’re minding your business, it sends you a criminal complaint to appear in court for debts to the State, even though you know you have been paying your regulated obligation each month like a fool. And I say “like a fool” because whether you pay or someone else doesn’t, both of you end up in court… equally accused. Of course, what actually happens is this: You go to court with a document from the tax office stating that you or your company is up to date with payments, and instead of being acquitted (since the law does not provide for it), you get a six-month adjournment to return with another document proving you are still up to date. More paperwork, more mental anguish, more legal fees, more wasted time in court. What can I say? It took them a few years, but they finally realized… Evripidis’ assurances Ahead of the New Democracy Parliamentary Group meeting and amid whispers, rumors, etc., the proposed secretary Apostolos Vesyropoulos took to the “main square” in recent days, searching for any dissenters, worried individuals, or those who might have the idea of setting up a ballot box. I hear that in one of these phone calls, he reached Evripidis “leader of the unruly” Stylianidis, who told him something along the lines of, “What are you saying, my dear boy? No issue with you.” Moreover, leader Evripidis, who is in contact with a wide range of people, is said to have dissuaded some who had thoughts of ballots and other complications. At the same time, however, he is “moving” around the “group of 11,” which will make interventions and “raise” issues. Message of de-escalation To prevent the situation from escalating, government spokesman Marinakis sent a message yesterday to ND MPs, distinguishing them from ministers on the issues they raise, including the salaries of uniformed personnel. “Ministers are one thing, MPs are another,” he explained, meaning that MPs have local issues to address or that voters ask them to highlight, making it a different category of concern. Obviously, the government wants to ease tensions so that they don’t come to Friday’s session with their belts loosened for a fight. Albert, Elafonisos, and Avgerinopoulou On to something more glamorous, as I hear that Prince Albert of Monaco will visit our country again, specifically the beautiful island of Elafonisos, in mid-April. Whether he will be accompanied by Princess Charlene, I do not know, but the reason for the Monegasque’s presence in our humble abode is to participate in the ELAFONISOS ECO event for the protection of the region’s marine ecosystem. I am told that Albert has particular concerns about the lionfish, and on April 14, a private dinner will be held in his honor. The strings of this invitation were pulled by ND MP Dionysia Avgerinopoulou, who is a friend of his and the president of the Parliamentary Committee on the Environment. And VIOHALCO eyes defense contracts The Prime Minister’s announcements today regarding “the planning of defense procurements and the country’s defense policy,” as mentioned earlier, follow European declarations on ReArm Europe, aiming to strengthen the EU’s military capabilities. With a firepower of €800 billion, developments at both national and European levels have long mobilized major domestic industrial groups, including, it seems, the VIOHALCO group. Reports indicate that communications recently took place to include the group’s subsidiary, Metallurgical Epirus, as a member of the Association of Greek Defense Equipment Manufacturers (SEKPY). Metallurgical Epirus, which had gone bankrupt, was acquired in 2018 by VIOHALCO and is now a subsidiary of Elval Halcor’s copper division. It was formerly a subsidiary of EBO (now part of EAS), manufacturing shell casings, bullets, etc. It remains to be seen what the group’s plans are to claim a share of the enormous defense procurement pie in the coming years. Smells like another upgrade The upgrade of Greek banks by Fitch has finally taken place, as this column mentioned yesterday. In fact, two of the four systemic banks—National Bank of Greece (NBG) and Eurobank—received an investment-grade rating. What is particularly interesting is that Fitch made a very positive reference to the Greek economy, stating that the performance of banks is closely linked to the Greek economy and benefits from its prospects. Given that Fitch will reassess Greece’s credit rating on May 16… another upgrade seems likely. Before that, S&P’s assessment will take place in mid-April. Maria Damanaki appointed Vice President of Quest Holdings Maria Damanaki has been appointed Vice President, as an independent non-executive member, of the Board of Directors of Quest Holdings. The well-known politician has been involved in the management of Theodore Fessas’ group for years. The…chaos of Korasidis Now, let’s move on to a truly fascinating and utterly… Greek story. Nearly 11 years have passed since November 2014, when Radio Korasidis was declared bankrupt, and yet the liquidation of its bankrupt estate is still ongoing. Since that distant time, bankruptcy trustee Gabriel Patrikios, a lawyer from Piraeus, has been engaged in a marathon effort to liquidate the remaining “silverware” and accurately record the company’s assets. Needless to say, even today, he continues to discover forgotten ownership rights belonging to a company that was once a leader in the electrical appliances market. To start from the beginning, he initially took over a plot of land in Mykonos, properties in Nea Filadelfeia and Koukaki, three warehouses in Rhodes, a plot in Pyrgos, Ilia, as well as a ground-floor store on Grigoriou Lambraki Street in Piraeus. Between 2015 and 2017, he proceeded with the liquidation of movable assets (merchandise, inventory, etc.). After lengthy bureaucratic delays, the liquidation of the real estate assets began in 2018. From then until 2021, the Mykonos plot, the properties in Nea Filadelfeia and Koukaki, and the three warehouses in Rhodes were indeed sold, while in 2024, the plot in Pyrgos, Ilia, was auctioned off via electronic bidding. Meanwhile, times had changed, governments had changed, and even the auction system had evolved… The adventure of the Piraeus offices The main “silverware” was the large office building that served as the company’s headquarters in Piraeus. Resolving the property’s ownership status and completing its legal retransfer to Radio Korasidis required years of legal and bureaucratic battles, which finally concluded at the end of 2022. Due to further procedural requirements and additional complications, the sale process only began in early 2024. A total of six attempts were made under the old auction system, with the last one on May 23, 2024, but none succeeded. Consequently, in October last year, electronic auctions commenced. Thanks to persistent efforts by the bankruptcy trustee, the process finally had a positive outcome, and on December 13, 2024, the large property changed hands, being acquired by Newsphone Hellas—owned by entrepreneurs Apergis and Theodosis, who also control Levante Ferries—for €3,417,100. Still uncovering properties and shares During the process, Patrikios has discovered additional properties (stores, warehouses) and even movable assets that were nowhere officially recorded. According to reports, these included shares of a major company, which, following the required procedures, were repurchased by the company itself. There was also a forgotten small plot of land next to the office complex in Piraeus, which was acquired by Newsphone Hellas. Even a portion of the rooftop of the Notos Galleries building in Kotzia Square belonged to Radio Korasidis, but despite dozens of property transfers over the years, no one had noticed it. In the coming period, the liquidation of the property that once housed the first Radio Korasidis store in Piraeus, on Grigoriou Lambraki Street, is planned, along with another property in Kallithea. Later, the logistics center in Thebes—considered the “heavy artillery” in terms of value—will also be auctioned. By then, more assets will likely be discovered by the trustee, who, in the course of this liquidation, has essentially become a detective. Increases in domestic container tariffs by PPA The PPA stock broke records in the first session of April. It recorded a double-digit percentage increase, coming within a breath of 40 euros for the first time ever. The historic high in revenue, profitability, and dividends announced the day before yesterday, following the release of the 2024 financial results, played a decisive role. At the same time, yesterday’s +12.66% was the fourth-best daily performance in its history and the highest in five years. Investor interest was intense, with turnover exceeding 1.3 million euros and volume reaching 34,000 shares. It is now just shy of 1 billion euros in valuation. In fact, if it strengthens further, PPA will become the 26th billionaire of the Stock Exchange. The stock market surge was triggered, as mentioned, by the results announced by management, particularly the historically highest dividend of 1.92 euros per share, which will be distributed by summer. Presenting PPA’s prospects to analysts yesterday, management, after promising full implementation of its investment program, strongly implied that it would proceed with a careful repricing of its services to justify its ambitious profitability targets, which bring the stock’s P/E ratio down to 10. Analysts were even more enthused by management’s intention to eliminate bank debt using just 10% of its cash reserves. Analysts now set an average price target of 48 euros, with an upside potential of more than 21% from current levels. Also of interest is the absence of the executive board member (former head of HRADF) Dimitris Politis, who is currently in China and is expected to return with new information and directions from PPA’s major shareholder. A chessboard over HelleniQ Energy Last Friday, despite the general downward trend, many willing buyers appeared for HelleniQ Energy shares at prices up to 7.94 euros. On Monday, with the broad market decline, HelleniQ Energy shares plunged -2.92% to 7.65 euros, though with increased turnover. Yesterday, the stock regained momentum at 7.7 euros. HelleniQ Energy is characterized by its high liquidity, allowing powerful portfolios with deep pockets to take advantage of fluctuations and “accumulate” shares or, if you prefer, “build positions.” Its shareholder structure consists of Paneuropean Oil & Industrial Holdings (Cyprus) Ltd with 40.1%, the Superfund with 31.18%, and 28.41% owned by the broader investing public. The key aspect of this shareholder structure is the lack of uniformity in the investment strategies of the major shareholders. Clearly, some parties are interested and—more importantly—exploiting the differences among key shareholders to consolidate their position for the future. The Superfund has started its visits In the past, HRADF held stakes in major energy companies and sought ways to capitalize on them. Today, things have changed. The Superfund, led by Giannis Papachristou—clearly in coordination with the government—is intervening much more actively in the energy companies it holds stakes in. The Superfund controls 31.18% of HelleniQ Energy, 100% of DEPA, 35.3% of PPC (where its CEO sits on the Board of Directors), 11.3% of EYDAP (where the state controls 61.33%), and 24% of EYATH. The new CEO of the Superfund has begun a series of visits to all these companies, demonstrating keen interest in shaping the country’s energy policy. From a passive shareholder (as HRADF was), the Superfund is now claiming a more active role. Moderate reaction With the German stock market celebrating the tariff countermeasures Europe is preparing to announce and the U.S. stock market suffering from fears of stagflation and a weak labor market, the General Index of the Athens Stock Exchange tried to showcase its resilience without exaggeration. Yesterday’s session was highlighted by the eleven stocks participating in today’s Wood & Co. roadshow in New York. Piraeus, Alpha Bank, Bank of Cyprus, Metlen, PPC, HelleniQ Energy, OPAP, GEK TERNA, Sarantis, and EXAE closed in positive territory, supported by the confidence exuded by their results and the business plans they will present at the roadshow. Yesterday’s session had a low transaction value of 151.22 million euros, with only 10.8 million euros in block trades, indicative of investor hesitation. The General Index remained in positive territory throughout the session, closing at 1,698.34 points with a 0.78% gain, having reached as high as 1,709.88 points (+1.46%) during the day. Alpha Bank recorded the highest transaction value of the day (29.8 million euros) and achieved the best performance among systemic banks (+2.23%) at 2.249 euros, while Piraeus, with 25 million euros in trades, closed with a gain of +2.1% at 5.154 euros. Eurobank rose +1.34% to 2.50 euros, while National Bank held at 9.5 euros (+0.61%). The day’s champion was PPA’s stock (+12.66%). ADMIE (+4.3%) returned to 3.03 euros, Noval (+2.06%), and Alumil (+1.42%) confirmed their momentum. New responsibilities for the Consumer Ombudsman Following the Code of Conduct on misleading discounts and commercial offers, the Ministry of Development is preparing a new regulatory framework that significantly strengthens the role and responsibilities of the Consumer Ombudsman. Until now, the Independent Authority “Consumer Ombudsman” has played an institutional, mediatory, and conciliatory role between consumers and the market. Since the consumer movement in Greece is essentially nonexistent, the government has decided to grant the Consumer Ombudsman more interventionist powers, aiming not only at informing consumers but also at enforcing compliance among commercial enterprises. The “liberation day” of the American economy He didn’t want to make announcements on April Fool’s Day because what he is announcing today is unbelievable. Starting today, the U.S. is imposing new tariffs, with President Trump calling it “Liberation Day,” a move that may prove as significant as President Nixon’s decision in 1971 to end the dollar’s gold standard. The new tariffs—25% on Canada and Mexico, even higher on China—are intended to protect American industry and are expected to trigger a trade war, leading to a depreciation of the dollar and rising goods prices. China has already announced countermeasures to mitigate the impact of the tariffs, but for Europe—with its massive trade surplus with the U.S.—the news is particularly worrying. The U.S. Trade Policy Uncertainty Index has surpassed 25%, higher than its peak during the first Trump Trade War. The S&P 500 has dropped more than 10.5% in six weeks and is now in correction territory, erasing $3 trillion in market value within days of trading. On February 19, the S&P 500 had reached an all-time high of 6,147 points. The sell-off accelerated in March when President Trump stated that he “does not watch the market.” Explore related questions

BlackRock outpaces competition: BUIDL surpasses Ethena and Paxos in digital asset market. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) has reached $1.92 billion in assets under management less than a month after breaking $1 billion. The explosive growth places it ahead of all but four stablecoins among tokenized RWAs, according to data from rwa.xyz. The fund, launched in March 2024 and administered via the Securitize protocol, invests in U.S. Treasuries and operates under a Reg D exemption. It has recorded a 183.97% increase in market cap over the past 30 days, driven by institutional flows and increasing adoption of tokenized money market strategies. BUIDL now ranks sixth among dollar-linked digital assets by market capitalization, just behind First Digital USD and ahead of assets such as Ethena’s USDtb, Tether Gold (XAUT), and USDD. With a $1 net asset value and 4.5% annual yield, BUIDL functions like traditional money market funds while leveraging blockchain rails for programmable liquidity. The fund spans Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Aptos, with over 90% of its supply on Ethereum. Among tokenized U.S. Treasury RWA funds, BUIDL is the largest by a significant margin, nearly tripling the size of Franklin Templeton’s BENJI and Paxos Gold (PAXG). Only Tether’s USDT, Circle’s USDC, MakerDAO’s USDS, and Binance-Peg USD maintain larger market caps in the broader digital dollar category. Institutional demand for regulated, yield-generating instruments on-chain appears to be accelerating, positioning BUIDL as a benchmark for treasury-backed RWAs integrated into public blockchain ecosystems.

Title: CBS Sports Sells MaxPreps to PlayOn in Youth Sports Media Shuffle
URL: https://www.sportico.com/business/media/2025/maxpreps-sale-playon-cbs-paramount-1234845892/
Time Published: 2025-04-02T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Jason Clinkscales Reporter/Editor, Breaking News Nine months after being put on the market, MaxPreps has a new home. PlayOn announced that it has bought the long-running prep sports media platform from Paramount’s CBS Sports. The acquisition brings MaxPreps alongside its new owners’ other high school media brands GoFan, VidSwap and the NFHS Network. The sale does not include CBS Sports’ other high school sports properties, 247Sports and Scout Media. Financial terms were not disclosed, but PlayOn CEO David Rudolph described the negotiation as a competitive process. “Like most deals … they probably would have loved for us to pay more, and we probably would have loved to pay less, which says it probably landed about where it’s supposed to,” Rudolph said in a video interview. Moving into a space long held by local newspapers, MaxPreps was launched in the summer of 2002 to cover high school sports. The site became popular due to its ability to crowdsource scores, rosters and schedules from coaches, athletes and schools. In time, MaxPreps expanded into college recruiting. Aiming to supplement its College Sports Television (now CBS Sports Network) and expand its portfolio of sports and entertainment websites, CBS acquired MaxPreps for $43 million in 2007. As he discussed the deal, Rudolph said he put the new acquisition to use to watch his daughter, a high school senior, play in her last home soccer game. “Whether you’re the fan, the student athlete, the parent, the grandparent, whatever you need to experience high school sports … we want to make it an awesome experience,” he said while noting his daughter’s team was up 1-0. “We’ve done that on the streaming side, on the ticketing side, and now bringing MaxPreps into the fold, that really lets us kind of complete that circle. “For me personally, this is the fulfillment of a 15-year vision; like we finally got the last piece to the puzzle.” PlayOn, based in Atlanta and nearby Alpharetta, was originally a division of Turner Broadcasting (and the larger Time Warner), digitally producing and streaming college sports. It was spun out of Time Warner in 2008 and began streaming high school sports in 2009. In 2013, PlayOn launched the NFHS Network, a joint venture with the National Federation of State High School Associations, as a subscription service for people to watch high school sports, including basketball, football, wrestling and cheerleading. In April 2022, PlayOn merged with GoFan, a ticketing and fundraising platform for high school sports that was founded in 2001. Though the company now owns several platforms that ideally serve the same consumers of high school sports, Rudolph said there are no immediate plans to consolidate all of them into a super app for a unified user experience. “I do think we will be looking at that, but I also think we’ve got to protect some of the custom-built consumer journeys that we create,” he said. “It’s still going to have to make it very easy and intuitive for the fan to be able to do the very specific action that they’re looking for.” Youth sports has become an active investment market recently, with private equity titans (and sports team owners) David Blitzer and Josh Harris making headway through Unrivaled Sports. PlayOn itself is a benefactor with KKR as a significant investor alongside existing shareholder and venture capital firm Panoramic Ventures. That’s not lost on Rudolph, who noted that youth sports—both through high schools and club sports—have provided lower price points for investors looking to tap into those highly engaged customer bases. “I think there are more and more people who are looking for ways to invest in sports, but don’t want to spend $6 billion to have a team that may or may not turn out to be a smart financial investment,” he said, noting the recent sale of the Boston Celtics. “I think they’re naturally looking at youth sports as a space. It’s a really fragmented space … so there are [more] opportunities to get involved.” Last June, Sportico reported that CBS Sports was exploring a sale of the site and enlisted Inner Circle Sports to assist in the process. LionTree Advisors (financial advising) and Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP (legal counsel) advised PlayOn on the acquisition. The move is the latest in a string of transactions by Paramount in recent years to pay off its debt. The media conglomerate sold PopCulture and ComicBook, formerly under its CBS Interactive division, to Savage Ventures last August. In 2021, Paramount sold CBS’ famed “Blackrock” headquarters and the network’s studio center in separate transactions for a combined $2.61 billion. It has previously fielded offers for BET, the Black-themed cable network that it purchased for $2.3 billion in 2000. Paramount awaits approval of a merger with Skydance, which is expected to close at some point in the first half of this year.

Stocks fell on “Liberation Day,” when President Donald Trump is set to unveil new tariffs on virtually all countries with which the U.S. has a trading relationship. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both dropped about 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 116 points, or 0.3%. Tech shares were mainly lower ahead of the import-tax announcement. Nvidia (NVDA-7.00%) fell about 1.7% as of 10:12 a.m., Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL-3.68%) dropped 0.7%, Microsoft (MSFT-1.77%) was down 0.5%, Apple (AAPL-9.76%) and Amazon (AMZN-9.05%) both declined about 0.4% and Meta (META-8.71%) was off 0.3%. Tesla (TSLA-5.86%) fell after quarterly sales fell short of expectations. Palantir (PLTR-4.23%) gained 1.3%. The long-awaited reciprocal tariffs will be “effective immediately” after Trump announces them starting at 4 p.m. EDT, the White House said Tuesday. On Monday, Trump told reporters that he’s settled on a tariff plan, but declined to reveal details. One option was a 20% duty on virtually all imports, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA-3.16%) reported. The White House has downplayed the possibility that Trump will make an announcement on additional sectoral tariffs on Wednesday, saying that while the president is still committed to them, he’ll roll them out later. Employers added 155,000 jobs in March, more than expected, increasing from an upwardly revised 84,000 in February, the ADP (ADP-0.68%) survey showed. Factory orders gained 0.6% in February, better than the consensus estimate but slowing from an upwardly revised 1.8% in January. Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler is scheduled to speak at 4:30 p.m. EDT on “Inflation expectations and monetary policymaking.” Some stocks to watch today: Newsmax stock plunged 41% after surging 179% yesterday to $233. The conservative cable news channel opened at $14 on Monday in its post-IPO trading debut. Tesla’s stock fell about 2.1% after Elon Musk’s EV-maker delivered about 336,000 vehicles in the first quarter, a 13% decline from a year earlier and far below analysts expectations for 390,000. Deliveries from its Shanghai factory dropped 11.5% year-on-year in March to 78,828. Many rivals, except for Ford (F-5.37%), have reported solid sales ahead of planned U.S. auto tariffs.

Title: It's clear Hasbro, the custodians of D&D, have no idea what to do with Baldur's Gate 3's success—but that's nothing new, it's spent the past 10 years fumbling the bag

The instant collapse of Sigil is just the latest in a long line of missed opportunities and self-inflicted wounds. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Dungeons & Dragons might be, if trends continue, one of the most mishandled success stories I've ever seen. And, if my powers of prophecy are correct, we're starting to approach the low bend of a 10+ year arc where Hasbro, the parent company of D&D owners Wizards of the Coast (WoTC), has continually fumbled the bag in just about every way it possibly could. Usually when I hammer out a timeline like this, I work in chronological order—but we're going to start in media res. It'll actually help us to work backwards: Starting with Baldur's Gate 3. In case you hadn't heard, we rather like Baldur's Gate 3 here at PC Gamer. While not all of us are CRPG-heads, those of us that are would probably consider it one of the all-time greats. Our own Fraser Brown even called it "the pinnacle of the genre" in his Baldur's Gate 3 review. For Hasbro and WoTC, it was the savviest deal possible for the "world's greatest role-playing game"—grabbing one of the best RPG development studios of our time to make something so far up its alley, it's like it was born for the job. Larian Studios, a shining goose to end all geese, spent several years meticulously creating a golden egg. Except in this metaphor, the goose has now waddled off, leaving Hasbro to run around carrying its egg-treasure with a brow full of flop-sweat—wide, panicked eyes looking for a place to actually put it. Their first move? Lay off most of the people who got Larian to make the thing in the first place. Yeah, I don't know either. The goose has now waddled off, leaving Hasbro to run around carrying its egg-treasure with a brow full of flop-sweat." I want to be clear: The idea that Larian decided not to make another Baldur's Gate game because of these layoffs is pure conjecture, and countermand to Swen Vincke's words on the subject. It's clear that the developer simply wanted to move onto games it was more passionate about, lest it consign itself to the geese farm forevermore. Not to mention, there's plenty of reasons why you might want to make your own IP rather than continuing to pay dividends to another company—BioWare did something very similar, hopping from Knights of the Old Republic to Mass Effect back in the day. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But, like, Hasbro can't have helped, right? As a studio, Larian's extremely outspoken about the kind of cost-cutting, short-sighted nonsense it pulled. Bare minimum, it would've been a point in the 'cons' column. Still, as Vincke has demanded—my tinfoil hat is off. The point is, Hasbro won't get another D&D game out of Larian. So what now? A huge amount of TTRPG players have, due to the struggles that come with trying to organise five adults into the same room every week, turned to Virtual Tabletops (VTTs) to get their fix. I'm one of them: Most of my games are online. WoTC decided to muscle in on the territory itself with Sigil—its own glossy VTT, a one-stop shop for all your D&D fun. Sensibly, Hasbro decided to put Baldur's Gate 3's cast in it as minis—which, while kinda kitschy, is in itself pretty cute. There's some table that'd get a kick out of Astarion guest-starring in their campaign, I'm sure. Except Sigil's not going to be the next big thing, and it might barely be a 'thing' at all. Sigil went into playtesting with a whimper, didn't quite work, and then Hasbro had 90% of the people making it laid off because, reportedly, "Hasbro treated Sigil like a video game instead of a VTT and at no point cared to understand the difference." So what's Hasbro doing with Baldur's Gate 3? The answer is an uncertain 'er'. Certainly, the line is that they've got exciting news to share just around the corner (who doesn't) but just listen to senior vice president of Digital Strategy and Licensing at Hasbro, Eugene Evans, as he spoke to PCG's own Robin Valentine last year: "I think it's too early to express specifics and I think that there's a much bigger question about how we approach Baldur's Gate in the future … But I would like to think that all of those characters, for the sake of the fans, could potentially appear in future products." And look, taking your time is sensible, but this was nearly a year on from Baldur's Gate 3's release—and Hasbro's plans haven't really moved on much since. To paraphrase, it's been a lot of 'we're thinking about lots of stuff, just trust me, bro'. Sigil went into playtesting with a whimper, didn't quite work, and then Hasbro had 90% of the people making it laid off." I'll tell you what Hasbro is doing: Ramming its feet into PR disasters. Just this week, a Stardew Valley mod had a DMCA flung at it right after Larian's Swen Vincke spoke well of it. They rescinded the strike, mind, but it's a PR blunder that's downright typical of the company by now. More on that later. I think it's clear, at this point, that Hasbro has no idea what to do with the egg. I mean, they put BG3 characters in Magic: The Gathering, because I wager that's one of the few things Hasbro knows how to make money with. But in my mind, what Hasbro needs to do is keep making good D&D videogames with great studios—not simply trotting out Karlach like she's a team mascot. And sure, maybe the company just needs some time to cook—but Hasbro's track record doesn't inspire confidence. This is simply how the company operates, and I predict we're destined to watch a toy and boardgame giant slip on the same banana peel over and over again. Let me take you back in time. It's March, 2015, approaching one year on from D&D's new 5th edition (5e). Now, 5e isn't doing terribly for itself—and, to be fair, WoTC did a solid job. It threw off the stink of 4e's poor sales (and worse community reception) and returned to its roots, grabbing parts of 3.5 and reworking them into a far more accessible package. But Critical Role? Now that was a tidal wave. In case you're unfamiliar, Critical Role is an 'actual play', a live streamed game of D&D run by voice actor Matt Mercer and his equally industry-experienced coterie of enthusiastic nerds. Its first episode aired and, simply put, it exploded. The ravenous beast of fandom sunk its jaws into the thing—heaps of fanart and fanfiction, the kind of liquid lifeblood that sends media properties into the stratosphere. In just a year, each episode of Critical Role had a million minutes watched each. Thousands of viewers would hop in to watch people play D&D live, every week, and suddenly wanted to play it themselves. That's not to say Critical Role was the sole author of this renaissance, mind—The Adventure Zone, itself inspired by a rising tide of D&D podcasting, had started a year beforehand, and it would soon be joined by a flood of excellent podcasts and shows. High Rollers, Dimension 20, NADDPODD, Dungeons & Daddies… Netflix's Stranger Things also helped bring D&D into the spotlight in 2016. But Critical Role by far seems to have made the most out of itself—transforming into a fully-fledged media company with enough chutzpah to crowdfund its own Amazon series. This was very, very good news for Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast—and to be fair, it's not like they didn't make some headway. Critical Role, for example, played a huge part in D&D Beyond's popularity, with routine advertisements for the product. It was ultimately a really smart move for Hasbro to pounce on a digital platform for their game at the height of its popularity. Except they didn't actually do that, did they? Because Hasbro didn't make D&D Beyond, and bought it after it became successful in 2022, but I mean—hey, that's just details, right? Regardless, WoTC continued to quietly enjoy this newfound popularity with adventure books and supplements—some of which were made in conjunction with Critical Role—but that was pretty much it. They benefitted from a whole ecosystem of creators nourished by new fans to the hobby, too, effectively doing free marketing for the game by making their own homebrew tomes full of monsters and rules. Then, in 2023, Hasbro took out a big gun and shot itself in the foot by trying to rewrite its Open Game License so, uh, nobody could do that. For almost a month, Hasbro became the villain of the TTRPG internet—until it eventually tucked tail and decided it was being very, very stupid. In April of the same year, it sent the Pinkertons after a Magic: The Gathering player. This did not help. For almost a month, Hasbro became the villain of the TTRPG internet." I'm not going to say D&D had some mass exodus away from the system—quite a few people stopped playing it, but not nearly enough to make a dent. Plenty of the shows from 5e's golden age of streaming are still playing the system because it's nice and comfy. But it's no coincidence that Critical Role would eventually start making its own rulesets like Candela Obscura and Daggerheart, and its Amazon Series has enough legally-distinct departures that Hasbro isn't profiting off it directly. Mind, CR certainly wasn't alone—the OGL blunder drove other companies, known for making D&D material, towards the creation of their own systems instead. Take Kobold Press, one of the most prolific creators of 5e content, which is currently cooking up its own competitor. Paizo's Pathfinder also hopped in to take their share of the dragon's hoard, debuting its own more equitable OGL by the name of ORC. 10 years of success and not a big, Hasbro-original idea to claim credit for. But hey, it's time for WoTC to cook up a new edition—a real chance to inject some new lifeblood into D&D. An opportunity for a fresh take on the formula, maybe? One that borrows popular systems from other RPGs that caught D&D's tailwind and—what's that? It's only a rules revamp? Ah. I've shared my thoughts on the 2024's Player Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual, and I'm not going to waltz in here and tell you any of them are bad. As a matter of fact, I've got plenty of nice things to say about them. The presentation is excellent. WoTC hired a whole host of brilliant artists to beautify their pages in a way that's really very charming—content-wise, it's more of a mixed bag, but there are plenty of screws that have been tightened on the bugbears of 5e's systems to make it more streamlined. You might wince at that statement (it's okay, I'm right there with you) but it's arguably the smartest move based on what D&D has become—which is to say, a jack-of-all trades fantasy game. It has just enough crunch to satisfy the min-maxers, with a simple enough entry that your storytellers aren't hemmed in. It's the "should we just get pizza" of TTRPGs, and in a hobby where the biggest limiter is time commitment, that's an important niche to fill. I could yap about how much I prefer PF2e all day, but let's be real, most tables are going to see its list of 4,000+ feats and get a headache. Still—the fact that WoTC didn't feel confident enough to reinvent much of anything after 10 years signals how paralyzed the entire operation has become, right? After a decade of successes, and after a massive, hobby-wide controversy seemingly couldn't sink it, D&D's next big move was to equip you with basically the same game for the next 10 years. No innovation, no progression, just a slightly different angle to the wheels spinning in the dirt. I might be calling the match a little early, and I want to be clear—I think WoTC has a lot of talented, eager, enthusiastic, and invested designers working for it. But when it comes to Hasbro, the overarching toy-making megagiant, and its leadership? I have vanishingly little confidence it knows what to do with any of its victories. Part of it might just be the fact that TTRPGs are hard to make money with. Hasbro's other properties, like Magic: The Gathering, create enormous value just by existing. Board games also have an easier time transitioning to the digital age, with apps like Monopoly Go! Hauling in $200 million every month in their heyday. Yet it almost feels like D&D is uniquely cursed. Take the movie, for example: Honour Among Thieves. It's really funny, entertaining, and passionate, and it even had broader appeal to a more mainstream audience without upsetting TTRPG vets, something I'd have thought impossible. I unironically really liked it, and would encourage anyone to give it a watch if pressed. It also only made $208 million on a $150 million budget at the box office—if you're keeping score, that's $58 million in profits (less, if that $150 million didn't include advertising costs). Or 1/4th of a month of Monopoly Go! At its prime, even in a best-case scenario where marketing was done cheap. Oof. After 10 years of success largely dropped in its lap, what does Hasbro—or Wizards of the Coast—have to show for itself? Let's tally things up: I don't mean to paint a picture of complete failure here—D&D is by far still the most popular tabletop game, and I don't see that changing any time soon—but the truth is, Hasbro's comical fumbling with Baldur's Gate 3 isn't some new, weird behaviour. It's the norm. This is a company that, from an outsider's perspective, barely understands its own product, doesn't really care to, and is growing increasingly impatient with its inability to turn it into a Magic: The Gathering. There are systems, products, and companies that would kill for D&D's ubiquity and household name—it's just a shame that the people on top are more enthused about how cool AI is than anything else.

BlackRock managed to land on the Financial Conduct Authority's tough crypto register on Tuesday, the regulators website showed. The world's biggest asset manager will be allowed to act as an arranger for iShares Digital Assets AG, which issue Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) — a financial instrument that is pegged an underlying asset, in this case a crypto asset. Registration on the U.K.'s crypto register is not an easy feat. The FCA's crypto register was set up in 2020 to ensure that crypto firms wishing to serve U.K. clients could only do so after they had registered to comply with the country's anti-money laundering rules. The U.K. has received 368 applications but only 51 firms have been approved. As an arranger, BlackRock will be able to "arrange the execution of transactions in cryptoassets to support ETP subscriptions and redemptions" between issuers and authorized participants but it will not be able to onboard any new customers. Also, it will not be able to operate a machine that "utilizes automated processes to exchange cryptoassets for money" vice versa - without written consent from the regulator. BlackRock joins the likes of crypto exchange Coinbase who recently managed to get on the register this year, though a new crypto regime awaits.

Title: Here’s Who Dropped Off Forbes’ 2025 Billionaires List

ByGrace Thomas ByGrace Thomas, Contributor. The world’s billionaire club has never been more crowded, reaching a record 3,028 members in 2025. Still, as in 2024, about a quarter of the list saw their net worth shrink compared to the previous year. For 107 entrepreneurs, investors and heirs on last year’s list, the drop was steep enough to knock them out of the three-comma club altogether. Billionaires who tumbled off the ranking include the tycoons behind several internationally renowned brands, such as Koo Bon-sik, an heir to the Korean LG electronics fortune; Shutterstock founder Jonathan Oringer; former Merck & Co. chairman and CEO Roy Vagelos; Thierry Cruanes, cofounder and chief technical officer of cloud-based data storage company Snowflake; and two French automotive heirs: Robert Peugeot and Marie-Hélène Peugeot-Roncoroni. China (including Hong Kong and Macau) saw the most billionaire drop-offs this year amid the country’s ongoing economic slowdown, with 22 names disappearing from the list (though that’s far less than last year’s staggering 133 drop-offs). Brazil shed the second-most billionaires (15), followed by India with 14. Only nine Americans who were on the 2024 list did not make the 2025 ranking, despite the U.S. having nearly twice as many billionaires as the next-closest nation. (An additional 32 billionaires died over the past year, and a 33rd passed away after Forbes went to press with this year’s list.) Just like last year, nearly one in four drop-offs came from the manufacturing industry, which was hit the hardest of any sector, with 27 drop-offs. Among them are Manny Stul, whose Australian toymaker is known for its Shopkins collectibles, and Indian textile tycoon Rameshchandra Jain. The finance and investments sector and the technology industry tied for the second-most drop-offs, with 12 apiece. This includes Sweden’s Harry Klagsbrun and Lennart Blecher of publicly traded private equity giant EQT AB, as well as China’s James Peng, whose autonomous driving company Pony.ai went public on the Nasdaq in November 2024. Its market cap now stands at $3.2 billion, down from an $8.5 billion valuation after a 2022 funding round. Thirty-two of the drop-offs were one-hit wonders, falling from the ranking after making it for the first time in 2024. Among them: Fernando Masaveu Herrero, the fifth-generation leader of Spanish conglomerate Corporacion Masaveu, and Shunsaku Sagami, founder and CEO of Japanese advisory firm M&A Research Institute. The fifth-generation descendant of Thierry Hermès first became the center of a complex saga involving his wealth in 2023, announcing plans to adopt his middle-aged former gardener and handyman in order to bequeath him at least half of his fortune. Doing so would have involved severing ties with the Isocrates Foundation, the charitable organization Puech established in 2011, which was originally designated as the primary beneficiary of his estate. Further convoluting matters, Puech alleged that his Hermès shares had vanished and that his then-financial adviser, Eric Freymond, had sold the shares without his knowledge. He lost a court battle over the matter last summer33, but still maintains that his shares are missing. The situation is even further complicated by the potential involvement of Bernard Arnault, head of LVMH and Europe’s richest person, who previously attempted a takeover of Hermès beginning in 2010. This has led some of Puech’s family members to believe that he secretly sold some of his shares to Arnault as part of Arnault’s botched buyout effort. A number of related legal proceedings are ongoing. It was a rough year for the founder of hospital network and health insurance provider Hapvida. Shares of the Brazil-based business lost nearly half their value, as the company dealt with accounting issues, debt renegotiations and increased judicial scrutiny of the Brazilian healthcare system. That, plus the Brazilian real’s depreciation against the dollar, made a huge dent in Pinheiro Koren de Lima’s fortune. Not to mention that Forbes is no longer crediting him with stock held by his ex-wife, whom he divorced in 2023. In April 2024, shares of Tianrui Group, the Chinese state-backed cement and steel conglomerate Li chairs, mysteriously plunged by 99% in a 15 minute trading window, due in part to a margin call that forced Li to dump nearly 5% of the company’s stock onto the open market, accounting for nearly half the day’s trading volume. Trading resumed in December, after being halted for eight months while the company investigated the situation, but the initial cause of the crash remains unclear, and the stock is still trading at just 5% of its value from last March. The founder of Thai renewable energy company Energy Absolute saw his fortune peak at $4 billion in 2022. But shares have tumbled since, losing 93% of their value since last year’s list, amid concerns about debt taken on to fund an ambitious expansion into electric vehicles and energy storage. Somphote was forced to sell shares to meet a margin call in June 2024. Two weeks later, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission accused him and two others of fraud involving the receipt of improper benefits via procurement contracts, prompting Somphote to resign as a director and CEO5=. He has denied the accusations and said he’ll cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation to prove his innocence. Liu cofounded server and storage maker Supermicro in 1993 with her husband, Charles Liang. While Liang, who owns more stock, is still worth an estimated $2 billion. Both have been victims of Supermicro’s sinking stock price, which is down 70% since last year’s list. The company delayed the filing of its financial statements for fiscal year 2024, after short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report accusing SuperMicro of accounting manipulation, self-dealing and sanctions evasion in August. The company’s auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned in October, despite Liang issuing a statement a month earlier that characterized Hindenberg’s report as false, misleading and inaccurate. In December, Su was named Time’s CEO of the Year, after leading semiconductor firm Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) through one of the greatest turnarounds in the history of the tech industry. Shares are up almost 3,000% since she took over as chief executive in 2014, but the stock has lost nearly half of its value since last year’s list, as the chipmaker struggles to keep up with its red-hot rival Nvidia. The price of spodumene, a lithium-rich mineral which Ellison’s Mineral Resources mines, crashing by 80% over the past two years, and the company’s high debt levels from an ambitious expansion of iron ore interests, already had him on shaky ground. Then, a tax minimization scandal sparked by an October Australian Financial Review report prompted a board investigation and the acceleration of his retirement. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has also launched a formal probe and is collaborating with the Australian Taxation Office. Ellison has stated that he is “deeply sorry for the events that have occurred” and acknowledges that he has made mistakes. The stock is down some 70% since last year’s list.

Title: The World’s Black Billionaires 2025

ByJabari Young ByJabari Young, Forbes Staff. Aliko Dangote, the wealthiest person in Nigeria, firmly believes in the phrase “seeing is believing.” Even after years of amassing his fortune, he sought additional confirmation of his wealth. To verify this, he drove to a bank on his own, wrote himself a check for $10 million, then cashed it. “I went home and opened it,” Dangote recalled in a 2019 interview. “I looked at $10 million (in cash) and I said, ‘Now I believe I have money.’–I took it back to the bank the next day.” Now if Dangote wanted to make a withdrawal, the banks might run out of cash before he does. On Tuesday, Forbes released the annual World’s Billionaires list. Dangote, the founder and CEO of the Dangote Group, the largest conglomerate in West Africa, ranks as the 83rd-richest person—and the richest Black person—on the planet. He’s worth an estimated $23.9 billion, up from $13.4 billion on last year’s list after nearly doubling his fortune with the opening of Africa’s largest oil and gas refinery. The $23 billion project converted a Nigerian marshland into the seventh-largest refinery in the world. Among the challenges of converting a jungle were moving 365 million cubic meters of sand from the sea, building a private port and private roads, and booking a 5,000-ton crane, one of only three in the world, years in advance. “It was the biggest risk of my life,” Dangote told Forbes in a February 2024 profile. “If this didn’t work, I was dead.” Dangote is the richest Black billionaire, but he isn’t the only one. Overall, there are a record 3,028 billionaires on this year’s ranking, worth a record $16.1 trillion combined. Twenty-three of them are Black—just 0.8% of the list—but they’re a wealthy and impressive bunch. Overall, these 23 have amassed $96.2 billion in wealth, mainly from the finance, energy and technology sectors. David Steward, an American IT entrepreneur, is the second richest, worth an estimated $11.4 billion. Private equity billionaire Robert F. Smith is the third-wealthiest Black billionaire, with an estimated net worth of $10.8 billion. Palantir Technologies cofounder and CEO Alexander Karp ($8.4 billion) and Nigerian businessman Mike Adenuga ($6.8 billion) round out the top five. Sheila Johnson, the cofounder of BET, is a new Black billionaire this year, as is Herriot Tabuteau, the founder of a biotech firm focused on brain disorders. NBA Sixth Man Junior Bridgeman was also poised to debut. Bridgeman amassed an estimated net worth of $1.4 billion before his untimely death in March. He would’ve joined four other Black athletes on the list who became billionaires: Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, LeBron James and Tiger Woods. “He didn’t waste his time just thinking about the game of basketball,” James told Forbes in February when discussing Bridgeman. “He’s always had a business mindset.” Michael Prince for Forbes The founder and CEO of Dangote Group began the painful process of building Africa’s largest oil and gas refinery in 2013. After 11 years, $23 billion in investment and innumerable headaches, the Dangote Refinery finally began operating in early 2024, helping boost Dangote’s fortune by $10.5 billion since last year’s list. The richest Black American cofounded World Wide Technology, which provides IT solutions to customers like Citi and Verizon, in 1990. He still serves as chairman of the private company, which now has nearly 10,000 employees and generates $20 billion in annual revenue. Smith founded $100 billion (assets under management) Vista Equity Partners, the largest Black-owned private equity firm in the United States, in 2000. He still runs the firm, which has more than 700 employees and focuses exclusively on investing in software companies. Karp is the cofounder and CEO of Palantir Technologies, a data mining company whose customers include the FBI, the Department of Defense and other government agencies. Palantir went public in 2020 and now has a market capitalization of nearly $200 billion. Adenuga made his first $1 million at age 26 as a commodities trader. Now he is one of the richest people in Africa thanks to his mobile phone network, Globacom, and his oil exploration outfit, Conoil. Abdulsamad Rabiu is the founder of BUA Group, a Nigerian conglomerate active in cement production, sugar refining and real estate. He launched the company 1988 and still serves as chairman and CEO. Through his foundation, the Abdul Samad Rabiu Initiative, he also supports education, health and social development projects across Africa. Often considered the greatest basketball player of all time, Jordan won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls. His salary during his career totaled $90 million, but he has earned more than $2.4 billion (pretax) from such corporate partners as Nike, Hanes and Gatorade. In 2023, Jordan sold his majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets in a deal that valued the NBA franchise at $3 billion. Today, he is one of just four Black Americans on The Forbes 400 ranking of the country’s richest people. Motsepe is the founder and chairman of African Rainbow Minerals, a diversified mining and minerals company with operations in South Africa and Malaysia. In 2008, he became the first Black African on the World’s Billionaires list. Martin Schoeller for Forbes Her hit talk show ran for 25 years, until 2011, and she reinvested the profits from the program and films such as The Color Purple and Selma into a media and business empire. In 2011, she launched cable channel OWN and sold most of her stock toWarner Bros. Discovery in 2020. One of the greatest hip-hop musicians of all-time, Jay-Z has won 25 Grammys and launched multiple businesses, including the fashion brand Rocawear (which sold for $204 million in 2007) and alcohol lines D'Usse and Armand de Brignac. In 2019, he became hip-hop’s first billionaire. A native of Nigeria and now a U.S. citizen, Ogunlesi is the founding partner, chairman and CEO of New York-based private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). In October, GIP was acquired by BlackRock for $12.5 billion in cash and shares. Following his retirement from the NBA in 1996, Johnson began investing, opening movie theaters and Starbucks franchises, often in Black communities. The majority of his fortune comes from a 60% ownership stake in life insurance company Equitrust, which has grown from $16 billion in assets under management to $27 billion since he took over in 2015. Johnson also owns small equity stakes in four sports teams, including the NFL’s Washington Commanders and the reigning World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers. Otedola made his first fortune in commodities before selling his shares in Forte Oil to invest in the energy business. Today, he is the chairman and majority owner of Geregu Power, a power generation business, whose other investors include the Nigerian government and the State Grid Corporation of China. Born in Lagos, Nigeria, Awotona moved to Atlanta when he was 15, and studied computer science at the University of Georgia before switching majors to business and management information. In 2013, he founded Calendly, a scheduling software startup, which private investors valued at $3 billion in 2021. Perry, who has built a platform as the second highest-paid TV showrunner, achieved billionaire status in 2020. He is best known for his "Madea" movie franchise, which has grossed more than $660 million. He also owns a quarter of the streaming platform BET+ and a 330-acre studio in Atlanta. Getty Images Over the course of his golf career, Woods has won 15 major championships (second only to Jack Nicklaus), 82 PGA Tour tournaments (tied for first with Sam Snead) and has won more prize money ($122 million) than any player in PGA history. However, the majority of Woods’ earnings have come from his lucrative brand deals, most famously with Nike. Born Robyn Fenty in Barbados—Rihanna is her middle name—she became a billionaire thanks to her cosmetics company, Fenty Beauty, which she co-owns with the French luxury conglomerate LVMH. Ibrahim founded Celtel International, one of the first mobile phone companies serving Africa and the Middle East, in 1998. Seven years later, he sold Celtel to Kuwait's Mobile Telecommunications Company for $3.4 billion and pocketed $1.4 billion. Since then, he's focused on fighting corrupt leadership in Africa through the Mo Ibrahim Foundation In 2022, James became the first active basketball player to become a billionaire, having earned more than $900 million (pretax) from endorsements and business ventures. James is a 21-time NBA All-Star, four-time NBA champion, and four-time NBA MVP. Masiyiwa founded Econet Group in 1993 and built it into a telecom conglomerate with operations and investments throughout Africa, South America and Asia. He still serves as chairman of the company and also sits on the boards of the Gates Foundation and Netflix. Lee-Chin made his money investing in financial institutions including the National Commercial Bank Jamaica and AIC Limited. He sold AIC to Canadian financial services group Manulife in 2009 for an undisclosed price, but still owns 60% of National Commercial Bank Jamaica, which accounts for nearly half his fortune. A newcomer to this year’s list, Tabuteau founded Axsome Therapeutics in 2012 with the goal of developing life-changing treatments for the millions of patients living with brain disorders. He owns 15% of Axsome, which he took public in 2015. Prior to founding the company, Tabuteau worked in healthcare finance, including as a partner at hedge fund Healthco/S.A.C. Capital. Getty Images Another newcomer to this year’s list, Johnson cofounded cable network BET with her then-husband, Robert Johnson, in 1979, and sold it to Viacom for $3 billion in 2001. Now, she’s the founder of hospitality firm the Salamander Collection, which operates hotels and resorts in Washington, D.C., Charleston and Jamaica, among other destinations. Through her investment in Monumental Sports & Entertainment, she also owns stakes in the WNBA's Washington Mystics, the NBA's Washington Wizards and the NHL's Washington Capitals.

Title: The Trump ‘Threat’ Helps Sell the War Racket in Canada and Europe

Back at the end of February, we wondered how the Trump administration officials dressing down of the Europeans would mix with the relentless propaganda against Russia — specifically whether it would lead to a rally-around-the-EU-flag moment similar to the time after the official start of the Ukraine war in 2022. That process is now in full swing and not just in Europe, but Canada too. Support for these EU and Canadian “rearmament” initiatives are being aided along by all the Trump noise. I say noise for the following reasons: Ian Lesser, director of the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund tells the New York Times the following. “The advent of the Trump administration has given history a shove,” he said. “We’re not in a linear environment, with a linear spending trajectory.” That same New York Times report mentions — as have many others — the Trump administration still supports NATO, plans to keep the American nuclear umbrella over Europe and remains committed to “collective defense.” In the SignalGate messages, VP Vance laments “I just hate bailing Europe out again.” Vance argued that bombing the Houthis to protect trade routes through the Suez Canal would benefit Europe much more than the US since only “3 percent of US trade runs through the Suez” and “40 percent of European trade does.” Well, that assumes that the US will be successful in “protecting” trade routes by bombing Yemen — which is far from a sure thing. And the US war crimes there are much more about bailing out Israel than Europe. Nevertheless, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth agreed with Vance: “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.” Vance was also miffed that the “bailing out” of Europe goes against Trump’s “message” about the EU. Even though Vance and Hegseth might be disappointed (that European nations aren’t bombing Yemen?), Trump’s “message” is still accelerating long-held dreams by neoliberal Atlanticists, such as the following: Now some EU plans look like they’re going nowhere fast. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s 800 billion “ReArm Europe” brainchild doesn’t have the full support of bloc countries it needs. And others from High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas to provide up to 40 billion euros in aid to Kiev and 5 billion euros toward providing Ukraine two million artillery shells this year are all but dead. That being said, several EU countries are dramatically increasing military spending, most notably Germany, which under incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz is losing its debt rules to spend big on its military. And the EU, even if “ReArm” never takes off, there are plenty of other options on the table. EU cohesion funds are financed by bloc governments in order to strengthen the economic, social and territorial unity of the EU through environment, transportation, and other infrastructure projects. Roughly one-third of the current seven-year EU budget of 1.2 trillion euros was for cohesion, but can now be used for defense. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is being pushed to direct more money and its AAA credit rating towards militarization. In 2022, the EIB began funding for dual-use projects, and the portion of lending going towards mitigating climate change or fostering economic growth has steadily declined as more money goes to Ukraine and military projects, but it is still unable to directly fund the production of arms and ammunition — something that helps it preserve that AAA rating. Most bloc countries are pushing for that to change. The Polish government recently announced that it will redirect 7.2 billion euros from its share of the EU’s post-pandemic recovery funds towards militarization spending. It’s the first — but perhaps not the last — bloc country to do so. None of these plans deal with the issue of the EU’s lack of soldiers and dearth of young men willing to enlist nor with the fact that even prior to Project Ukraine, NATO already massively outspent Russia on defense, yet the dramatic redirection of money from social spending to weapons companies continues nonetheless. It’s easy to see the dynamic at work here. Trump demands five percent of GDP spent on defense. NATO members go to 3.5 percent — a significant back-breaking jump from two percent. Ursula aims for 800 billion, but instead cohesion funds and EIB spending is redirected. And the more the Trump administration kicks the EU around, the more militarization initiatives in Europe gain support. That’s also the product of years of anti-Russia propaganda. One feels the table is set for the next manufactured crisis to go for broke. They’ve already got people taking to the streets to demand it. The People Want War? How genuine or realistic the Trump administration’s efforts are to end the war in Ukraine are debatable, and conclusions often change by day. (And let’s not forget Russia has the ultimate say.) But one thing is certain: just by making noise about peace in Ukraine and leaving Europe to fend for itself, Trump has helped sell European militarization spending. Here’s a piece from the Associated Press, “Tens of thousands join pro-Europe rally in Rome, amid worries over European Union’s plan to rearm.” This is in Italy, one of the least supportive publics in Europe for Project Ukraine with major class divergence on the benefits of EU membership, so that gives you an idea of the crowd likely skewed, but still. Tens of thousands of Italians joined a pro-Europe rally in Rome’s city center Saturday, waving blue European Union flags in a sign of support and unity as a European push for rearmament divides the country. The initiative, supported by most of the center-left opposition parties, despite their different positions, was launched by Italian journalist Michele Serra at the end of February, with an editorial in the Italian daily La Repubblica titled: “Let’s say something European.” “I wanted to organize a large demonstration of citizens supporting Europe, its unity and its freedom, with no party flags, only European flags,” Serra said, launching the slogan: “Here we make Europe, or we die.” The initiative was born in response to U.S. President Donald Trump ’s destabilizing policies, which created an unprecedented rift between Europe and the U.S., strained over the war in Ukraine and an ongoing tariff battle. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni has reluctantly backed an EU plan to rearm Europe over concerns that the proposal by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen might weigh on Italy’s giant debt, diverting much-needed funds to weapons spending. Depending on where you sit, getting 30,000 out to protest for weapons manufacturers profits and the gutting of social services could be considered either an impressive or depressing achievement. Nevertheless, is it representative of the wider mood? A few recent polls have some interesting findings. Eurofound shows a slight reversal in the trend of European publics souring on Project Ukraine: A more extreme case of Trump-inspired EU militarization fever can be found in bloc’s recent Eurobarometer survey. The poll, conducted for the European Parliament in January and February, found that 74 percent of EU citizens thought their country benefited from EU membership. That’s the highest recorded level since the question was first asked in 1983. Why are people feeling the love for Brussels? Because the EU “strengthens security”: There’s also this: As always, these results should be taken with a grain of salt since it’s in the EU interest for citizens to support more centralization in the name of “protection.” And so the results are also interesting for what the EP chose to emphasize and subsequent media reports chose not to highlight, including the following: Or how about the following? Most of those values are under threat from the EU, not by any outside forces. While they might have gotten numbers they craved on “the role of the EU to protect,” the increased support for Brussels comes despite the realization beginning to break through that life will not be getting any better: That will no doubt still be the case even once the Trump shock is gone and the rally around the flag euphoria wears off — just as it did following the start of Russia’s special military operation in 2022. Neoliberal Warmongers’ Reprieve One area the Trump effect is more clearly showing itself is in bumps of support for Western politicians and parties thoroughly discredited for their Project Ukraine support in recent years and the disastrous effect it has had on economies at home. Here’s FT: Canada’s ruling Liberal party was facing a humiliating loss in upcoming elections. Then came Donald Trump. Party leadership contenders vied to display strength against the US president, his tariffs and his desire to take over Canada – and Liberals’ poll ratings began surging. Under new prime minister Mark Carney, with the slogan “Canada strong”, the party is now narrow favourite to win a historic fourth straight term. The former Bank of England governor has become emblematic of global leaders enjoying a ratings bump after going head to head with Trump. Polling in several countries, from Mexico to Ukraine, shows even unpopular leaders like France’s Emmanuel Macron are enjoying some relief from voters as they seek to ward off menaces including tariffs, the withdrawal of military support and even the threat of US conquest. Even Zelesnky, who has Ukraine on the verge of extinction, has got wind in his sails: Zelenskiy’s overall approval rating has shot to 67 per cent while his net approval is 38 per cent – the highest scores since December 2023 – even as he seeks to mend relations by accepting Trump’s proposed minerals deal and partial 30-day truce. Trump’s comments were seen as “unfair, a stab in the back” and “a wider attack on the country, rather than just criticism targeting the president”, said Anton Hrushevsky of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Macron is going to need a lot more help (like, say, the barring of his main rival from office), but he’s up six percentage points to a depressing 27 percent in an Elabe survey this month. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer who’s even more impressive than Macron in that he sunk to similar approval levels in a fraction of the time, saw a double digit rise in approval rating as the UK public rallies around the Starmer slime in the face of what they view as Trump’s unfair treatment of Ukraine. Nathalie Tocci, director of Rome’s Institute for International Affairs told FT the following: “You have this bully that is smashing the system. Rather than just kissing the ring, these leaders basically stand up and politely say ‘no’, and their voters appreciate the fact that they are not being colonised.” But is that really true? Beneath the Surface It’s Business As Usual Europe still refuses to do anything about the energy elephant in the room and despite all the big talk remain mostly subservient to the US. Canadians might be flying the maple leaf everywhere you look, but how’s that surge of patriotism playing out in Ottawa? Canada is in talks to get in on the EU’s increased military spending. Brussels says it wants to prioritize European-made products, but there are doubts about that. According to the Stockholm International Peace Institute: Arms imports by European states were 94 per cent higher in 2019–23 and 55 percent came from the US, a substantial increase from 35 per cent in 2014–18. The next largest suppliers to the region were Germany and France, which accounted for 6.4 per cent and 4.6 per cent of imports, respectively. The EU, as part of the Trump spat, is looking to reduce that dependence and is hoping on Canada. According to the New York Times, “Canada, according to the terms of the discussion, would also be given preferential access to the E.U. market for military equipment, an alternative to buying equipment from the United States.” There are issues there, as well: Canada’s military industry, which is relatively small, has been used to produce Canadian equipment but has also been a regular contractor for building American military equipment or parts. Canadian factories across the vast country produce munitions, tanks, aircraft, technological defense systems and navy ships. An in-depth industry review in 2022 found that about half of Canada’s military equipment was exported and half kept domestically. The top export destination, by far, was the United States. In the meantime, Ottawa is sending billions to one of Canada’s wealthiest families in the name of defense. From The Breach: The Liberal government has handed $8 billion to one of Canada’s wealthiest families—and they’re counting on Canadians not to notice. The deal awards Irving Shipbuilding, owned by the notorious Irving dynasty, a six-year contract to start building three new destroyers for the Canadian navy. Even military insiders have slammed it as wildly overpriced. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. By the government’s own estimates, the ships won’t be finished until 2039—and by then, the total cost will have ballooned to at least $22 billion. The government boasted the deal will help protect Canada’s sovereignty and create jobs. But at a time when Canadians are struggling with the cost of living, a crumbling healthcare system, and a planetary crisis, it’s clear what this really is: a massive corporate handout in disguise. An enormous grift? Sure, but it must be done due to Trump’s threats to Canada’s national security. Canada is spending another $6 billion to develop an Arctic radar detection system — again part of the US desire to militarize the region, which European countries like Sweden, Finland, and Norway are also helping with. The UK just announced it’s going forward with buying more F-35s despite all the supposed worries about a Trump kill switch. Canada, too, has yet to cancel its purchase of 88 F-35s costing more than $14 billion — although Ottawa says it’s “doing its homework.” To make it abundantly clear where these governments priorities are, these massive expenditures come as the UK slashes benefits for those with disabilities (and won’t even make a document describing the cuts available to blind people set to have support slashed), and Canada offers more support for the disabled to die than to live. And incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz touts his plans for further cuts to Bürgergeld and other social spending as Germany authorises 1 trillion euros in new loans for militarization. Canada and the EU continue to do the empire’s bidding against the likes of China and Iran and play along in Syria and elsewhere. The Italian-owned Mediterranean Shipping Company is working with the Trump administration and Blackrock to take over a portion Middle East shipping infrastructure — a big part of the US strategy to reverse the tide of China’s growing control over global logistics. Ottawa is engaging in its own trade war against Beijing, which is approved of by Washington. The EU is making noise about rapprochement with China, but there has been no movement yet, and many in Brussels are offering to get even tougher on Beijing as a way to please the US. Meanwhile, there’s still no peace with Russia as the Atlanticists enact what have been their goals all along — primarily other members of NATO spending a lot more. As Politico put it, “One imagines that Trump administration officials are patting themselves on the back for finally getting the Germans to take more drastic action on defense spending, meeting a long-time goal of many U.S. administrations to strengthen the European pillar of the transatlantic alliance.” Yes, there have been calls for this for years, and they ramped up considerably after the beginning of Russia’s SMO. Here is just one example from the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) writing last year in Foreign Affairs about Washington’s need to focus on China: That complicated reality requires U.S. allies, especially in Europe, to take on a larger share of directing the containment of Russia. Europe has shown its political and economic resilience in the face of Russian aggression. Yet militarily, the continent remains dependent on the United States. This dynamic must change, in part because the United States must commit more of its resources to Asia. The growth of European defense spending since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is an encouraging step. In 2023, 11 NATO members hit their spending target, allocating at least two percent of GDP to national defense, up from just seven members in 2022. The rest need to follow suit. It might be a stretch to say it’s all part of a coordinated plot, but while the increase in military spending might be coming amid a war of words — and some tariffs — the Atlanticist think tanks funded by and expressing the will of American plutocrats are getting what they wanted — and in some cases even more. ‘War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.’ . – George Orwell Aye. The solution to Capitalist overproduction; the MMT Jobs Guarantee. Along with the warnings from Brian Berletic’s New Atlas series, this observation early in Conor’s grim review reminds us ” long-held dreams by neoliberal Atlanticists, such as…: The crushing of the welfare states in Europe and Canada, which goes hand-in-hand with… Rearmament. Ultimately, the benefits of rearmament go first and foremost to the Western arms companies.” Just as 70 years of economic hostility tries to crush Cuba’s exemplary welfare state, reckless warfare and economic policies elsewhere send waves of refugees across the Mediterranean to Europe, crashing welfare states and turning people against their own compassionate policies. While 1960 subtracted from 2025 does come to “only” 65 years of economic warfare, the campaign seems to be baked into Washington’s dream of an economic overthrow – for the foreseeable future – unless and until US politics can be reshuffled. This whining reminds me of something: ‘Nevertheless, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth agreed with Vance: “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.”’ Which is: Nothing like U.S. macho guys (and macho ladies) sniveling. When was the last time any of them asked what military bases and weapons programs are truly needed, and which are just the usual U.S. boondoggles and displays of dominance? And let’s recall the division of Europe and other little inconveniences like the division of Berlin and Gorizia. The Americans can let the leases lapse on Ghedi and Aviano. The demo organized by Michele Serra has come in for criticism for not standing for anything. Europe? Values? The word “valori” is being thrown around here in Italy these days, and I note that in the graph on values the most-voted value by the populace is peace. Oh. Maybe the social state? Italians are fully aware that after thirty years of stagnant wages the Rearm EU thingy, now called Readiness!, is guaranteed to lower Italian wages further. Five Stars (supported by AVS = Sinistra + Greens) is organizing a demo for 5 April in Roma. We will see how it goes. This is a straight-out anti-rearmament, pro-peace demonstration, rather than oooshy values-waving. As a preliminary, the CGIL and ARCI are backing a demo today here in the Chocolate City. I will walk over to the Piazza Castello later to see what’s what. As to quoting Nathalie Tocci. Foul play, Conor Gallagher! She’s a turbo-Atlanticist who sure loves those wars (as so many lady warmongers do) and regular in the propaganda-laden front pages of La Stampa. Who’s next? Pina Picierno? Say it ain’t so, Joe. On quoting Tocci: It didn’t feel great doing it, but what a perfect encapsulation of the dynamic at play. Aurelien’s observation in his most recent essay: “Take, by way of contrast, roles traditionally attributed to men and women in times of crisis and war. From the earliest times, men were expected to fight, and if necessary die, whilst women encouraged them to do so. (The “women as peacemakers” meme was commercially successful for a while, but as the example of Frau von der Leyen shows, nature generally reverts to type.) Men were biologically more dispensable than women, and indeed, once they had fathered the replacement number of surviving children, their future was of less importance anyway.” https://aurelien2022.substack.com/p/being-non-transactional On needs only to look at Naked Capitalism’s Not-So-Cold-War section each day to see a trajectory of events, and future “peace” Russia faces. Even Dima at Military Summary is saying Trump 720 degrees is/needs to find more military funding of Ukraine in the future beyond Biden’s last formal request to Congress so as to keep “diplomatic” pressure on Russia to agree to a ceasefire. Because “peace”. While Dima isn’t so good at interpreting US politics he is somewhat a bell weather and words things broadly if not always correctly. I’ve never been comfortable with the framing of Russia “winning the war but losing the peace.” The peace we see the West preparing for, a constant, long range, never ending war and accelerated construction of huge US miliary bases in Romania with nukes pointed directly at Russia, that we see everyday at Not So Cold War? Very good overview of the current situation. Here in Canada I think it is best to keep in mind Cockburn’s quip that you can only believe a politician when he/she denies whatever is at hand. Or in other words, when they say they are telling the truth you know they are lying. If they say it did not happen, then it really did happen. In Canada focusing on Trump and tariffs has been a godsend to the Liberals in the current election. 10 years of lacklustre minimal change in social benefits (dental care, daycare and pharmacare), the Liberals have structured these concrete improvements in people’ lives to take years to actually be meaningful for most of the population. I am cognizant that these social advances in the US would be revolutionary and maybe only legislated into practice after an overthrow of the current constitution. As to armaments and Canada participating in Europe and with Europe keep in mind that this document “NORAD modernization project timelines Fact sheet: NORAD modernization project timelines” dictates down to the size of a screw and where and how it will be used and this policy welds Canada to the US MIC and US foreign policy. Buying European arms means that Canada would have to integrate these weapons, etc. with the US MIC. Now how likely is that. If anything Canada is Trojan Horse for the US to maintain its hegemony in worldwide weapons specs and production. As to the Canadian election, Pierre “Skippy” Poilièvre’s best and only asset in Conservative circles is that he is really angry. And , and a big and, comes across as really authentic, but for the electorate there are no feasible or practical solutions being proposed to make people’s lives better. In Canada we have been living in a neoliberal hell run by Tweedledum and Tweedledummer at least since I have been old enough to vote (circa 1980). Whether you vote Team Red or Team Blue it doesn’t matter — it’s always neoliberal cola in every bottle. What few tiny improvements in social welfare that have been achieved since the ‘60s have mostly come when the Liberals are forced to include the New Democrats (NDP) in a minority parliament, so I suppose I can extend that meagre hope … Today’s NDP is a neoliberal party. Their much-touted dental plan, besides being confusing, is neither universal nor public. It’s not universal, because (a) dentists can opt out, and (b) anyone whose employer offers benefits is disqualified–even if a particular employee doesn’t actually receive those benefits. It’s not really public, because the system is managed by Sun Life. What’s worse, this plan exposes Canada’s health care system to attack under our various trade treaties. Now that a private firm can bid for health care management contracts, Canada could be sued to open the sector to competition. In other words, this dental program does NOT represent an extension of social welfare. Instead, it’s the fatal chink in the armour, that might doom universal public health insurance in Canada. But what else would you expect, from the government now headed by the typical guy from Goldman Sachs? “Smart” policy, as we like to say nowadays. And it couldn’t have happened without the NDP. I’m pleased you worked “Racket” into your title, Conor. Sadly too little has changed since Smedley Butler’s time. Against what threat does Europe rearm? Russia? It does carry on hysterically about Russia, doesn’t it? I say again, against what threat does Europe rearm? We are in Smedley Butler”s wheel house. War is a racket. The MIC are racketeers. Lindsey Graham revealed it. Ukraine is the best kind of war. Profits with little to none of “our blood.” Lindsey is a racketeer and a cheer leader for racketeering. He is one voice in a crowd of racketeers in the DC Bubble & Echo Chamber stuffing their pockets with the largesse of the MIC. It is all so stupid, so disingenuous, so callous, so self-serving, so calculating. Throw the bums out. Which bums you ask? Really? You cannot be serious. I note that Europe has a very long history of using its arms on its neighbors centuries before there was ever a military-industrial complex. By the government’s own estimates, the ships won’t be finished until 2039 By then Yemen will probably have domestic hypersonic production. Grift is an understatement. The problem with such short-term shenanigans is that they exacerbate the long-term problems that necessitate them. I haven’t seen any indication that the eurocracy has any appreciation or even an understanding of just what is driving the overall souring of the public mood and the rise of far-right populism. These are going to accelerate as the graft of Rearm Europe further concentrates wealth and resources into fewer hands. re: German incompetence in security affairs If anyone wants to read yet another document which offers proof of the utter incompetence of German “elites” to seriously change course read this 2-pager (German but quickly translatable.). Signed by some of the 15 best known “doves” in security affairs. STATEMENT “RATIONAL SECURITY POLICY INSTEAD OF ALARMISM,” March 30, 2025 Rational security policy instead of alarmism https://johannes-varwick.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Final__Rationale_Sicherheitspolitik.pdf “(…) Russia is undoubtedly a threat to European security, and aggressive intentions beyond Ukraine cannot be completely ruled out – although hybrid threats are more plausible than traditional military ones. However, a sober look at Russia’s economic and military capabilities, as well as its (realizable) intentions, reveals little evidence that Russia could or even would want to engage NATO militarily and attack its territory. A Russia that has great difficulty achieving its goals in Ukraine is a manageable military threat. Furthermore, NATO is, and will remain so for the foreseeable future, disproportionately stronger than Russia in virtually all military respects. (…) Without a reliable American security guarantee, Europe must reposition its security policy. (…)” Some of the signatories most likely are the same who early 2023 in a peace memo on Ukraine argued that the war had so far cost 50.000 civilians´ lives – because the US Armed Forces had told them so – ??? What else do you need for proof for the insanely low level we are operating here. The letter´s intention I fully agree with. But that is seriously high school level. Since the alternative would be another 30 years war or WWIII. But not this way. Which is void of any real professional insight into the matter of security. The 15 individuals who have signed in private might have certain more far-reaching expertise that would matter to this public statement. But the major thrust as presented here beyond any doubt shows you that: 1) These laughably compromising formulations are a lip service at best without any force behind them. 2) There is no substantive understanding of how military affairs have changed on the tactical and the strategic level. 3) No substantial consequences will be drawn – such as ending NATO, cancelling MDF as of 2026, cancelling F-35s, a non-nuclear European zone in conjunction with RU as laid out by RU in Dec. 2021 So part and parcel of this mindset is 1) Russia is weak because they “struggle” in Ukraine to reach their objectives (seriously???!). 2) NATO-Europe so goddam strong. 3) Russia might pose some danger. All of this makes it obvious that there is NO – and I repeat this here – NO hope for German elites and thus German public at large to resist meaningfully the sell-out via new war budget and thereof destruction of this society. If even those who are allegedly the experts (which they obviously are not at least as public statements go) fail to take a decisive position which would be the only position to open a new path towards Russia and BRICS then WHO should? Since none of this would stop Merz or anybody else for real. So if I despair this is one major reason, why. I love it. A classic case of the deranged leading the demented and dragging the despairing down with them. Soon they’ll be bickering amongst themselves, relations will start to break down and an armed conlict, fought with washing machines and fast loading broomsticks, will breakout and nobody outside “the garden” will notice Europe bleeding to death because fonda Lyin’, with the enthusiastic support of Europe’s national political élites, has turned it into a clapped out confederacy with little political and economic substance whose only value to the real world of prosperity, innovation and high per capita incomes will lie in its use as a source of low skilled bonded labour, hookers and a few slabs of stone for the tourists to gawk at in their desire to experience history flowing backwards as Europeans are forced to pay off all the debts owed to the rest of the world. re: German crisis BERLINER ZEITUNG: Letter of urgency by German family companies to Merz “The situation is dramatic”: Family entrepreneurs write open letter to Merz and SPD The CDU and SPD government plans have met with considerable criticism.

Title: CoreWeave shares rebound 42% after initial IPO dip

CoreWeave’s shares surged nearly 42% on Tuesday, recovering above their initial public offering (IPO) price after a subdued second day of trading. The stock closed at $52.57, resulting in a market capitalisation of nearly $25bn, reported CNBC. The Nvidia-supported cloud computing firm had seen its shares decline by over 10% on Monday, dipping below the IPO price of $40. The stock had opened at $39 on Friday, marking the largest venture-backed tech IPO for a US company since 2021, and closed flat at $40. Last week, CoreWeave adjusted its offering price to $40, down from an initially anticipated range of $47 to $55, and reduced the offering size to 37.5 million shares from 49 million. As part of the IPO, Nvidia placed a $250m order, contributing to the $1.5bn raised, according to Reuters. Headquartered in Livingston, New Jersey, CoreWeave offers access to data centres and Nvidia chips, which are in high demand for AI application development. In its IPO filing last month, CoreWeave reported a revenue increase of over 700% in 2024, reaching $1.92bn, despite a net loss of $863.4m. The company supplies cloud-based Nvidia processors to major clients such as Meta and Microsoft, with Redmond accounting for 62% of its revenue last year. CoreWeave has secured contracts exceeding $15bn that are yet to be fulfilled. In the fourth quarter of 2024, CoreWeave reported $747.4m in revenue, maintaining a gross margin of about 76%. Despite recording an operating income of $112.7m, interest expenses resulted in a net loss of $51.4m. By year-end, the company’s debt approached $8bn. Furthermore, CoreWeave refuted claims of contract withdrawals following a Financial Times report in March suggesting that Microsoft, the company’s largest client, had retracted from certain agreements. “We pride ourselves in our client partnerships and there have been no contract cancellations or walking away from commitments. Any claim to the contrary is false and misleading,” a CoreWeave representative stated via email to Reuters. Last month, CoreWeave secured an $11.9bn contract from OpenAI to provide essential AI infrastructure, significantly enhancing the computing capabilities of the ChatGPT developer. This five-year partnership aims to support the global distribution of OpenAI’s models to millions of users. In addition to this agreement, OpenAI will invest $350m in CoreWeave stock, a transaction separate from the company’s IPO. CoreWeave operates a cloud service network centred on AI, consisting of 32 data centres. By the close of 2024, these sites contained more than 250,000 Nvidia GPUs, including the latest Blackwell GPUs tailored for AI reasoning tasks.

Title: Companies used to tout their climate plans. Under Trump, they’ve gone quiet.

Time Published: 2025-04-02T08:45:00Z
Full Content:
Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Just a few years ago, pledges to tackle climate change were a staple of corporate PR. Amazon trumpeted its climate pledge and stamped it on the name of Seattle’s biggest arena. Walmart promised to slash a gigaton of carbon emissions from its supply chain, and the world’s largest money manager, BlackRock, with its $11 trillion in investments, pressured companies to come up with a plan to zero out their emissions by 2050. Now, many corporations are avoiding the subject altogether. During earnings calls, mentions of many well-known terms related to the climate are down 76 percent compared to three years ago, according to a recent analysis of S&P 500 companies by Bloomberg. The sharpest declines came from financial firms and consumer discretionary companies, the category for those offering optional purchases, like Starbucks and Airbnb. The hesitancy to talk about climate change — sometimes called “greenhushing” — could decrease pressure on the big corporate polluters that have been slow to cut their emissions. The trend has been linked to a growing backlash against sustainable investing, as well as a shifting political landscape with President Donald Trump’s second term underway. “I think large companies in particular today are very, very cautious,” said Hortense Bioy, the head of sustainable investing research for Morningstar, a financial services firm. Companies have been caught in a tug-of-war: On one hand, investors are pressuring them to be serious about the risks of climate change to their business. On the other, the mention of any word related to so-called ESG — the polarizing acronym that refers to “environmental, social, and governance” investing — threatens blowback from the Trump administration. The way to thread the needle, experts suggest, is to stay away from flashpoints like ESG and talk specifically about the financial risks that the warming planet poses to companies. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How John Marshall, the CEO of the Potential Energy Coalition, a nonpartisan marketing firm focused on climate action, says that silence isn’t a winning strategy. “We do not think that voters or consumers are at all impressed, regardless of their political stripes, by taking the concept of climate change out of any language,” Marshall said. His research shows that investors and the public want companies to talk about climate change — as an investment risk, not a matter of morality. According to a Potential Energy report from last September, 3 in 4 Americans surveyed think companies have a responsibility to limit their impact on the climate. What’s more, roughly 9 in 10 U.S. retail investors want companies to reduce emissions and prepare for the ways increasingly unpredictable weather could lead to risks like supply chain disruptions and rising insurance costs. The first signs of greenhushing appeared in 2023, when the Swiss consultancy South Pole found that a quarter of large companies around the world had decided not to publicize their progress on climate targets. The reason, South Pole later found, was that companies wanted to avoid the legal risks that came with high-profile pledges. It was a response to countries crafting new laws against “greenwashing,” the term for deceptive environmental advertising. At the same time, financial institutions were already dealing with the backlash against ESG, which heated up in 2022. Lawsuits targeted asset managers, pension funds, and federal agencies, claiming that “woke capitalism” was putting politics over financial interests. Red states including Florida and Texas pulled billions in state funds out of BlackRock and other ESG-friendly firms. BlackRock, which in 2021 had supported almost half of shareholder proposals to address environmental and social issues, pulled a U-turn. Between July 2023 and June 2024, it only backed 4 percent of them. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How “They were too visible and too vocal about what they were doing in that space,” Bioy said. She expects that companies with big climate plans may now have to disclose the opposition to ESG as a risk in their annual reports. That sense of caution is showing up in the markets, too: Over the last two years, there has been more money leaving sustainable funds in the U.S. than what’s coming in, according to Morningstar’s research. Bioy suspects that trend still has room to run, given Trump’s hostility to climate action. In December, corporations including Apple, Walmart, and Siemens failed to sign an open letter reaffirming their commitment to the Paris Agreement, a letter organized by the climate coalition they joined after Trump’s first presidential victory in 2016. Bioy pointed to the guidance circulating in government organizations warning against using terms like “pollution,” “clean energy,” and “climate science.” “Companies that do business with the administration or any state organization, they will be careful not to use those terms,” Bioy said. In the past, some companies have used language around climate change that embraced a moral framing, such as “do the right thing.” But most people don’t think that’s the province of what businesses should be doing, Marshall said. Two-thirds of Americans believe that businesses should avoid taking a stance on political issues, according to his firm’s research. The moral framing provokes backlash because it feels like “forcing an idea on somebody,” Marshall said. “We have seen it’s much more effective to have language in the business community that’s about money and reality.” It raises the broader question of how regular people should talk about climate change when many of the terms environmental advocates use can provoke a knee-jerk reaction. “I think that the climate movement needs to be very thoughtful about and strategic about whether or not it is a DEI or ESG initiative,” said Austin Whitman, CEO of The Change Climate Project, a nonprofit offering tools to help businesses cut their emissions. “I think for all of us across the spectrum, regardless of what cause we’re fighting for, we need to distance ourselves from these lightning-rod acronyms and topics that are really easy to just cut down with a single swipe.” This story has been updated to clarify Apple and other corporations’ involvement in the climate coalition they joined.

Title: BlackRock approved to offer crypto services in UK, expanding digital asset footprint

BlackRock's FCA approval restricts operations to ETP support, significantly narrowing its crypto asset activities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock has secured approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to operate as a registered crypto asset firm in the United Kingdom. The approval places BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, among a growing list of regulated companies in the region, including Coinbase and Kraken. This milestone also marks a significant step in the asset manager’s continued expansion into the digital asset space over the past year. According to the FCA’s website, the registration allows BlackRock to support its only client, iShares Digital Assets AG, in managing crypto-related exchange-traded products (ETPs). These products offer exposure to specific cryptocurrencies and are backed by the underlying assets. However, BlackRock’s role is highly restricted and tailored to a narrow scope of services. The firm is permitted to conduct the following activities: Facilitate the execution of crypto asset transactions to support ETP subscriptions and redemptions between the issuer and designated authorized participants. Sell digital assets for fiat currency to cover operational expenses for itself and the issuer’s service providers. Convert digital assets into fiat during early redemptions of the ETP. Meanwhile, BlackRock is not allowed to onboard new clients for this service unless it receives written permission from the FCA. Furthermore, the firm is restricted from operating automated machines that convert fiat to crypto or vice versa. It is also prohibited from holding or controlling client funds. Market observers have suggested that the approval could allow the firm to expand its iShares Bitcoin ETP to the UK. Last month, BlackRock launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP for European users via the Euronext exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, and Germany’s Xetra exchanges. This product is available to institutional and knowledgeable retail investors. It aims to provide secure and regulated access to Bitcoin through traditional stock exchanges. The ETP has a temporary fee waiver that reduces its total expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of the year. It is denominated in US dollars and backed by Bitcoin, which Coinbase holds in offline cold storage. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Whale alert: Over $1B in USDT minted as Bitcoin investors gear up to buy the dip

Bitcoin broke out from a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders pattern and is poised to hit the $88,500 level. Bitcoin [BTC], the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, appears bullish and is poised for massive upside momentum. This bullish outlook is further supported by the recent minting of 1 billion USDT by Tether, as reported by Arkham on X (formerly Twitter), indicating increased demand from institutions or exchanges. Historically, the minting of USDT is often seen as a bullish sign for the crypto industry, especially for large assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a result of this mint, the overall cryptocurrency market is already witnessing an uptrend, rising by 1.80% over the past 24 hours, with BTC also breaking out from a bullish pattern. According to AMBCrypto’s technical analysis, BTC has turned bullish on the smaller time frame. Recently, with ongoing upside momentum, it broke out from a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the hourly time frame. Based on the recent price momentum, if BTC closes its hourly candle above the $84,000 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 5.50% to reach the upcoming resistance at $88,500 in the near future. Source: TraduingView At press time, BTC’s price was facing resistance from the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame and appeared to be breaching it as well. If this occurs, BTC could see an imminent rally. In addition to this bullish price action, the blockchain-based transaction tracker Lookonchain recently shared a post on X stating that Tether bought 8,888 BTC worth $735 million in Q1 2025. This occurred during a period when BTC experienced a price drop of over 18%, indicating that the current level could be an ideal buying opportunity. Tether is not the only major player that bought BTC during the recent price crash. Major firms like Strategy (MSTR), BlackRock, and others have also seized this opportunity and accumulated BTC. This massive purchase by these industry giants gives hope that the current level might be an ideal buying opportunity. At press time, BTC was trading near $84,100, having experienced a price surge of over 2.60% in the past 24 hours. Following the minting of 1 billion USDT and the recent breakout of a bullish pattern, traders and investors have shown strong interest in the asset, leading to a 45% jump in BTC’s trading volume during the same period. This surge in trading volume is explained by traders’ $1 billion worth of bullish bets. Today, the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reported that traders are over-leveraged at the $81,800 level on the lower side and $84,355 on the upper level, which is on the verge of liquidation. Source: Coinglass Data revealed that traders have built $989 million worth of long positions and $287 million worth of short positions at these over-leveraged levels in the past 24 hours. So, bulls are back, and that BTC could see an impressive upside move. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

The benchmark indices closed higher on Wednesday, rebounding from the previous day’s losses as investors appeared to reassess the potential impact of US President Donald Trump’s anticipated reciprocal tariffs announcement. The BSE Sensex surged 592.93 points or 0.78 per cent to close at 76,617.44, while the NSE Nifty climbed 166.65 points or 0.72 per cent to end at 23,332.35. Benchmark indices rebounded, led by realty sector, amid expectations of an interest rate cut; market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. The rupee consolidated in a narrow range and settled for the day 2 paise lower at 85.52 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, as the support from positive domestic markets was negated by uncertainty over trade tariffs. Rupee ends flat against US dollar amid trade tariff uncertainty, supported by positive domestic markets and weak dollar. BSE Stocks Today, BSE Share Price Live news & updates 2nd Apr 2025: Shares of BSE Ltd are in focus today. The stock continues its gaining momentum for the second trading session after announcing bonus issue. The board on March 30, 2025, announced issuance of bonus equity shares in the ratio 2:1. The company will inform the record date for determining the entitlement in due course, according to a stock exchange filing. Track live updates here Track live updates Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a recovery rally, with the Nifty ends 167 points higher while the Sensex was up by 593 points. Among sectors, most of the major sectoral indices traded in positive territory, but the Realty index outperformed, rallying over 3.35 percent. Technically, on intraday charts, after a muted opening, the market found support near 23150/76000 and reversed. Following this reversal, it maintained positive momentum throughout the day. Additionally, it formed a bullish candle on daily charts, supporting a further uptrend. We believe that as long as the market is trading above 23150/76000, the pullback formation is likely to continue. On the upside, it could move up to 23500/77000. A dismissal of 23500/77000 could push the market towards 23650/77500. Conversely, if the market falls below 23150/76000, selling pressure may intensify, and it could slip to the 23000-22950/75500-75300 range. - Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Top gainers on the NSE: Tata Consumer Products, Zomato, Titan, IndusInd and Tech Mahindra Top losers: BEL, Nestle India, UltraTech, Bajaj Finserv, Power Grid Mamaearth launches new mosquito repellent campaign with Shilpa Shetty Kundra, offering natural protection for children.

Bharat Dynamics (BDL) has achieved turnover of over ₹3300 crore (Provisional & Unaudited) during the FY 2024-25, against the previous year’s turnover of ₹2,369 crore registering a record growth of around 40%. BDL shares soared 3.83% on the NSE to ₹1,292.90. ING FX Strategist, Francesco Pesole, comments ahead of Trump’s anticipated tariffs on ‘liberation day’: “Media reports have suggested that Trump is planning a 20% tariff on most US imports, roughly equating to $660bn in expected revenues when taking the 3.3tr as a reference value for US imports. But it’s also been reported that a tiered system with different rates or a customised approach is being considered. Expectations are also that some sensitive sectors can be excluded to minimise the impact on US producers and consumers. There is an open question of whether new tariffs will be added to existing ones on autos and metals or if only the highest tariff rate will be in place. “The second layer of FX impact will depend on the geographical distribution of tariffs. Markets may be taking the 20% flat rate as a baseline, which can generate a stronger dollar reaction across the board, but the details of country-specific and product-specific duties should determine how single currencies will behave in the crosses. We still think European currencies are facing greater downside risks in this sense. Finally, the US administration’s tone on negotiation room will be a key factor for market reaction. “We have seen some sharp outperformance of AUD, NZD, NOK and CAD overnight as a flat tariff as opposed to case-specific reciprocal tariffs is seen as slightly more lenient and crucially less unpredictable. Our view remains that downside risks dominate for all currencies against the dollar today. The US may try to announce the harsher measures today before eventually scaling it back, which may still force a positioning rotation into USD and JPY with high beta currencies taking the bigger hit. But dollar outperformance today will not be indicative of more sustainable strengthening. Time will be needed to assess how long tariffs will remain in place: alongside US data releases (watch ADP payrolls today), that will determine the USD outlook. We still favour USD appreciation beyond today’s event, but it will hardly be a smooth ride.” SAR Televenture Limited, a leading network infrastructure company listed on NSE, has announced that its Board has approved the share swap for acquisition of a majority stake in Tikona Infinet Limited, a prominent internet service provider, for a total consideration of ₹578 crore.

April 01, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC), TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMDX), Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA), and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) Class Period: November 16, 2023 - February 4, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s channel management initiatives were not progressing as represented; (2) that, faced with pricing pressure, the Company had made the decision not to compete on prices and instead walk away from sales opportunities; (3) that, as a result, the Company had inflated inventory in the channels in “LATAM, including Brazil, Asia, including India, as well as Canada and Eastern Europe;” and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the FMC class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/FMC TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMDX) Class Period: February 28, 2023 - January 10, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 15, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) TransMedics used kickbacks, fraudulent overbilling, and coercive tactics to generate business and revenue; (2) TransMedics engaged in unsafe practices and hid safety issues and generally lacked safety oversight; (3) the foregoing subjected TransMedics to heightened risk of scrutiny and regulatory risk; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about TransMedics’ business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the TransMedics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TMDX Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - January 8, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Intellia's Phase 1/2 study evaluating NTLA-3001 for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-associated lung disease. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s timeline for the aforementioned study, specifically that Intellia expected to dose the first patient in the second half of 2024. Defendants failed to disclose inter alia that the demand for viral-based editing was rapidly dwindling as non-viral delivery methods became a main target of the scientific research community due to their cost-effectiveness and more efficient development, thus making NTLA-3001 an inefficient program for Intellia to maintain. The alleged truth emerged on January 9, 2025, when Intellia published a press release announcing Company reorganization. In pertinent part, defendants disclosed that Intellia would be halting all NTLA-3001 research and studies and that the Company would be reducing its workforce by 27% in 2025. Specifically, the Company announced that management decided to focus Intellia’s resources on other pharmaceutical development and would be implementing cost saving in the form of a major reduction in force. As a result, defendants pipeline priority readjustment resulted in the Company’s once-touted NTLA-3001’s discontinuation. Following this news, Intellia’s stock price fell from a closing market price of $12.02 per share on January 8, 2025 to $10.20 per share on January 10, 2025. For more information on the Intellia class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NTLA Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) Class Period: February 3, 2022 - February 3, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China's approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck's ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 "there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that "GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%" "primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.

April 01, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI), Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB), and Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Skyworks class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SWKS Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Maravai class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MRVI Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) Class Period: November 12, 2024 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Rocket Lab class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/RKLB Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH) Class Period: October 22, 2024 - January 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates' expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company's ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. On January 28, 2025, Manhattan Associates issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Among other items, the Company disclosed services revenue of $119.5 million for the quarter, growing by only 0.3% compared to the year-ago quarter and falling approximately $2 million short of the guidance provided in October 2024. Manhattan Associates attributed the results to delays in professional services work and deferred deals, predicting that the Company's services revenue would reach a low point in the first quarter of 2025 and that solid revenue growth would not resume until mid-year. Manhattan Associates further revealed emerging challenges in its services business, noting that around 10% of customers with ongoing implementations had scaled back their planned services work for the upcoming calendar and fiscal year. The Company also announced that its 2025 revenues would see modest growth of just 2% to 3%, while GAAP EPS was expected to decline by 10% to 13%. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $72.26 per share, or 24.49%, to close at $222.84 per share on January 29, 2025. Then, on February 10, 2025, Manhattan Associates announced that Eddie Capel, Manhattan's President and Chief Executive Officer, would retire from those positions effective February 12, 2025. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $23.20 per share, or 11.55%, to close at $177.70 per share on February 10, 2025.

Title: China Blocks Panama Canal Port Sale — Report Claims Xi Jinping Infuriated by Deal Sought Without His Approval
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2025/04/01/china-blocks-panama-canal-port-sale-report-claims-xi-jinping-infuriated-by-deal-sought-without-his-approval/
Time Published: 2025-04-01T22:16:54Z
Full Content:
Chinese antitrust regulators on Friday blocked a deal by the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison conglomerate to sell two ports along the Panama Canal to a consortium led by investment giant BlackRock. The $22.8 billion transaction between CK Hutchison, which is controlled by 96-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, and BlackRock involved 43 port facilities around the world. It was scheduled to conclude by April 2. The most strategically important, and politically explosive, acquisitions of the sale were ports located at either end of the Panama Canal. President Donald Trump has portrayed Chinese-owned ports on the Panama Canal as threats to American national security because the Chinese military could potentially use them to shut down the canal. He hailed the BlackRock deal as a major step toward alleviating that threat when it was announced in last month. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal,” Trump said on March 5. International markets seemed to like the arrangement as well, sending CK Hutchison stocks into the stratosphere. However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not echoed this enthusiasm, according to new reporting by Al Jazeera and Watcher Guru, a finance and cryptocurrency website. Per the reports, Dictator Xi Jinping has allegedly been displeased that Li did not consult with him about the deal or clear it with Party officials. According to Al Jazeera: The Wall Street Journal earlier this month reported that anger over the deal extended all the way to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the newspaper [the Chinese state-run Ta Kung Pao] said Xi was angered that CK Hutchison had not sought his approval for the deal and that he had hoped to use the Panama Canal ports as a bargaining chip with Trump, who has pledged to “take back” the strategically important waterway. Watcher Guru also cited a recent Ta Kung Pao op-ed as describing the transaction as a “betrayal of all Chinese people.” Influential Chinese state media blasted CK Hutchison in mid-March for “spineless groveling,” while Beijing’s puppet administrator in Hong Kong, John Lee, ominously muttered that the deal deserved “serious attention” from regulators – even though there was no obvious legal pretext for the Chinese government to get involved. The necessary pretext was evidently discovered at the eleventh hour, as China’s State Administration for Market Regulation suddenly announced it would investigate the deal to “protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest.” Within hours of that announcement on Friday, CK Hutchison said “there will not be an official signing of the two Panama ports deal next week.” The sale is not technically dead, but there is presently no indication of how long the Chinese government intends to continue its vague antitrust investigation. “We are confident that Panama will require the sale of these assets within its sovereign territory,” a White House official told the New York Post on Monday. The Post editorial board said Beijing’s effort to scuttle the BlackRock deal proves Trump was “dead right” about the menace China poses to U.S. interests in the Panama Canal. “China’s rulers look determined to retain control of the strategically critical maritime conduit – whether to threaten U.S. access to the key shipping lane or to ensure it will remain open to Chinese vessels no matter what,” the editors wrote. “Beijing might stand down when it realizes its heavy hand in Hong Kong’s commercial market will frighten more firms out of doing business there – yet another step toward killing the golden goose of what had been a global financial center,” they suggested. Beijing has indeed been fretting about the flight of foreign capital from Chinese markets, in part because the overbearing Communist regime has launched a string of crackdowns against both Chinese and foreign business operations. Also, despite carefully worded promises that Xi’s deranged citywide coronavirus lockdowns will never be repeated, the shadow of the immense damage from the pandemic looms large over foreign business decisions. BlackRock itself has about $16 billion invested in Chinese stocks, which might give the gigantic investment company enough leverage to get the CK Hutchison deal rolling again after a brief regulatory delay. Or Xi could use those investments as leverage against the company, threatening its portfolio to ensure BlackRock accepts the quiet demise of its Panama Canal ambitions. Al Jazeera on Tuesday suggested an internal Chinese political and cultural angle that might be almost as significant as the international ramifications of the Panama Canal deal. It suggested that there is bad blood between aging Chinese dictator Xi and the even more aged CK Hutchison tycoon Li Ka-shing. Li is something of a legend among Hong Kong investors, and Xi is severely allergic to businessmen who have a stronger grip on the public imagination than he does. Per Al Jazeera: Li’s rise from a mainland Chinese-born refugee to Hong Kong real estate tycoon holds an almost mythical status in the Chinese territory, a former British colony, where he built his reputation navigating Western business interests and the Communist Party. Li was known for his close relations with Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, who oversaw China’s economic opening between the late 1970s and early 2000s, but his political influence waned following Xi’s rise to the top job in 2012. … In 2018, Li passed control of his company to his son, Victor, but the tycoon has stayed in the limelight. The following year, Li angered pro-Beijing commentators with his ambivalent comments about Hong Kong’s mass pro-democracy protests at a time when other companies in the city were openly critical of the demonstrations. Legal and business analysts quoted by Al Jazeera tended to side with the White House official who spoke to the New York Post, predicting that it will be legally difficult for Beijing to kill the deal if Panama exercises its jurisdiction over the canal and gives its blessing. For that matter, the legal authority of Beijing’s top market regulator to quash transactions made by a Hong Kong company is dubious. The antitrust investigation announced on Friday could be an attempt to intimidate Li, his family, and CK Hutchison executives into backing out of the sale. And it could perhaps send a signal to other Chinese businessmen as the trade war heats up that no matter whose names are printed on their company letterhead, Xi Jinping is the chief executive officer of every business in China.

(NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Commentary: Even Hong Kong’s Li family can’t escape the politics of China-US rivalry

Commentary For two weeks, Hong Kong’s richest family, led by Li Ka-shing, held firm against Beijing over the planned sale of its Panama ports assets to BlackRock. That, in itself, is truly extraordinary, says former SCMP editor-in-chief Wang Xiangwei. This audio is generated by an AI tool. HONG KONG: The arm wrestling between Beijing and Hong Kong's richest family, led by Li Ka-shing, over the controversial sale of Panama Canal ports to BlackRock, an American investment giant, has surprisingly persisted longer than anticipated. After two weeks of apparent silent defiance, the Li family seemed to relent on Friday (Mar 28) when local media, citing sources close to CK Hutchison, reported that the conglomerate founded by Mr Li would not proceed with the expected signing of a deal on Apr 2 to sell its two strategic ports at the Panama Canal. This development marks the latest flashpoint in the geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States. On the same day, news emerged that Beijing would launch an antitrust probe into the sale, part of a US$23 billion deal to sell 43 ports across 23 countries to a consortium led by BlackRock. While Beijing may appear to have succeeded in delaying the sale, this does not necessarily mean the deal is dead. The saga is expected to continue in the coming weeks or even months, potentially involving top leadership in both Beijing and Washington. CK Hutchison announced the deal on Mar 4. Less than 10 days later, Beijing-controlled newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, which is based in Hong Kong, published two sharply worded commentaries, urging the Li family to “stop being naïve and confused”. They criticised CK Hutchison of being unpatriotic and "selling out all Chinese people." This marks the first time Beijing has publicly singled out Hong Kong's most prominent conglomerate for sharp criticism in the 27 years since the city's return to Chinese sovereignty, causing jitters and concerns about the politicisation of business in the local and broader business community. Beijing's apparent loss of composure stems from not being informed of the deal in advance, amid US media reports that BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink called US President Donald Trump to secure his blessing. Mr Trump hailed the deal as part of his administration's efforts to reclaim the Panama Canal. Despite finding themselves in a political storm, the Li family has surprisingly kept its cool. In fact, the Mar 4 announcement, which stated that the sale was purely commercial in nature and unrelated to geopolitics concerning the Panama ports, remains CK Hutchison's only public statement to date. Incensed by the silent treatment, Ta Kung Pao and another pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po have published at least 20 news stories and commentaries urging the Li family to respond to "public concerns" and halt the deal in the name of national interests and security. The wrangling reached a climax on Mar 26 when Bloomberg cited sources reporting that CK Hutchison was believed to be moving forward with the deal as scheduled, despite Beijing's anger over the transaction. In response, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office again signalled its displeasure by reposting two articles published by Ta Kung Pao on Mar 26 and 27, criticising CK Hutchison for capitulating to US pressure and sacrificing national interests. The following day, CK Hutchison finally relented amid reports that the State Administration for Market Regulation in Beijing would investigate the deal "to ensure fair competition" and "safeguard the public interest." Until then, Beijing had hoped that intense media pressure would suffice to persuade the Li family to pause the deal, mindful of the potential impact on business confidence in Hong Kong and China if it intervened directly. Ta Kung Pao's use of politically charged language in its commentaries has caused dismay among Hong Kong businessmen, with accusations of "aiding and abetting evil" reminiscent of wording frequently used in China's past political campaigns. In the past, such pressure tactics would have quickly forced any Hong Kong company to capitulate. The Li family's ability to withstand the pressure for two weeks is truly extraordinary. In another extraordinary development, Richard Li, the younger son of Li Ka-shing, seems to be distancing himself from CK Hutchison, which is controlled by his elder brother Victor Li. The younger Li attended a high-profile forum in Beijing with senior Chinese officials and global executives on Mar 23 and 24, in his capacity as founder of Pacific Century Group. On Mar 28, China's leading business media outlets, including Caixin, published stories stating that Pacific Century Group’s businesses operate independently. The articles particularly noted that Richard Li resigned from all positions at CK Hutchison in 2000. What happens next? The delay could mean that the main parties involved in the deal, including CK Hutchison and BlackRock, will have to renegotiate the terms to accommodate both Beijing's and Washington's concerns. More likely, it will be a topic of discussion in an anticipated meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr Trump, expected to take place in the coming months.

Title: Here's how much Ozempic and similar drugs have soared in popularity since 2018
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-glp-1s-non-diabetic-use-triples-study-1851774076
Time Published: 2025-04-01T18:35:00Z
Full Content:
The use of GLP-1 meds — made popular by Ozempic (NVO-1.38%) — among U.S. adults without diabetes more than tripled between 2018 and 2022, with annual spending surging from $1.6 billion to $5.8 billion. The findings were reported by MedPageToday on Tuesday, citing a new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), using an unweighted sample of 90,000 adults. They found that the percentage of U.S. adults without diabetes filling at least one GLP-1 prescription increased from 0.1% in 2018 to 0.4% in 2022 — representing approximately 854,728 adults. By comparison, about 5.1 million adults with type 2 diabetes filled a prescription for the drugs that same year, according to a separate study. The total number of people taking GLP-1 treatments today could also be much higher. In a May 2024 survey of 1,479 U.S. adults, about 12% said they’d taken a GLP-1 agonist, and almost one third said they’d heard “a lot” about these treatments, according to the health policy non-profit KFF. GLP-1s are a class of drugs that have been used for decades to treat diabetes. They mimic a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar and can also suppress appetite. But a newer generation of these drugs — such as Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Eli Lilly’s (LLY-3.54%) Mounjaro — has fueled a surge in demand. Unlike older versions, which required daily doses, these newer medications are injected just once a week. Demand skyrocketed even further after the drugs were approved for weight loss. Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy received approval to treat obesity in 2021, followed by Eli Lilly’s Zepbound in 2023. By 2022, 65% of GLP-1 users without diabetes were on semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Most GLP-1 users without diabetes were female (64%) and white (73%), with an average body mass index (BMI) of 35.7, classifying them as obese. The blockbuster success of these drugs has transformed Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into two of the world’s most valuable pharmaceutical companies. Novo Nordisk’s total revenue rose 26% in 2024 to $40.5 billion, while Eli Lilly saw a 32% jump, reaching $45 billion.

Title: Musk and Zuckerberg Top Forbes’ Tech-Heavy Billionaires List
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-top-forbes-billionaires-list/
Time Published: 2025-04-01T17:43:19Z
Full Content:
The X boss has seen his net worth jump from $192 billion to $342 billion, even as his Tesla shares have taken a big hit in 2025 Despite a brutal start to 2025 for Tesla, Elon Musk has still seen his net worth increase enough over the past 12 months to jump to the top of Forbes’ annual Billionaires List, which was released on Tuesday. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, jumped into the runner-up position following a big year for the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. Musk sits atop the magazine’s ranking of the world’s richest people with a net worth of $342 billion. That comes a year after he was ranked second, when his net worth was “only” $195 billion. Musk’s gains over the last year stem largely from Tesla, the electric car company he runs, which has seen its share price increase 55% in the last year; Musk controls roughly 20% of Tesla’s shares, according to a regulatory filing last year. That 55% increase comes even after Tesla’s share price has been hit hard in recent months. Countless videos of people vandalizing — and in some cases, blowing up — Tesla cars have been circulating, as violent protestors have been upset with Musk’s support for President Trump and his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk recently said those who are attacking Tesla cars because of his work with the government need to “stop being psycho.” While Tesla’s stock surged following the 2024 election — Tesla hit an all-time high market cap of $1.5 trillion in December — that momentum did not carry into this year, with Tesla’s share price dropping 29% since the start of 2025. Musk’s move into the top spot bumped French businessman Bernard Arnault and his family from the No. 1 slot. Arnault, who runs LVMH, the conglomerate that owns luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior, moved down to fifth place this year with a net worth of $178 billion. Zuckerberg, as mentioned above, jumped two spots from last year and is now ranked as the world’s second-richest person, with a net worth of $216 billion. His jump coincides with Meta’s stock price increasing 20% in the last year. And while he has not been as closely tied to President Trump as Musk, Zuckerberg’s relationship with the president has seemed to improve a great deal compared to where it was just a few years ago; Meta notably kicked President Trump off of its platforms in early 2021, following the Capitol Riot. That seemed like a lifetime ago, though, when Zuckerberg was among a who’s who of tech executives who sat behind President Trump during his inauguration in January. Overall, the tech sector is represented more than any other sector among the world’s richest men. Six of the 10 richest men — as well as nine of the 20 richest — work in tech, according to Forbes’ rankings. And that does not even include Musk, which Forbes puts in the “automotive” sector — even though he made his initial fortune via PayPal and he runs companies like SpaceX, X and xAI. In related news, XAI acquired X last week for $45 billion, which included $12 billion in debt. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is ranked the third richest-man with a net worth of $215 billion, while Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison is ranked fourth with a net worth of $192 billion. As for media names, Rupert Murdoch is the richest man in the media world with a net worth of $23 billion. He is ranked 87th overall this year — up 13 spots from last year. Interestingly, five of the names on the Forbes list are tied to Thomson Reuters; Sherry Brydson, the largest shareholder of Woodbridge, the investment arm of the Thomson family, is ranked as the 125th richest person, with a net worth of $16.7 billion. Liberty Media chairman John Malone also moved higher this year, going from being ranked 290th to 230th as his net worth climbed $1 billion to $10.8 billion.

April 01, 2025 13:31 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, April 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Merck & Co., Inc. ("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Merck investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=139923&wire=3 MRK investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Merck during the relevant time frame, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT?

April 01, 2025 12:50 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, April 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 28, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 28, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Intel will spin off its 'non-core' businesses, new CEO says

Intel (INTC+2.16%) will spin off some of its non-core businesses, newly minted CEO Lip-Bu Tan said at the company’s Vision 2025 conference in Las Vegas on Monday. “Going forward at Intel, we will redefine some of our strategy and then free up the bandwidth. Some of the non-core business, we will spin it off, but really focus on our core business and how to expand that using AI and Software 2.0,” Tan said in what was his first public appearance as company CEO. Tan didn’t directly name which businesses were going to be considered core versus non-core. Tan was named CEO earlier last month, coming on the heels of a rocky time in the tech giant’s history. “It had been a tough period for quite a long time for Intel, we fell behind on innovation and as a result, we have been too slow to adapt and meet your needs,” Tan said, addressing the crowd of customers and investors in Las Vegas. “I will pull together strong teams to correct the past mistakes and start to earn your trust. My motto is very simple: under-promise and over-deliver, that has been my trademark,” he added. The company has been struggling to keep pace with competitors like Nvidia (NVDA-7.00%), which replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average back in November 2024. The company has also been the target of possible acquisitions and has been working with investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS-9.63%) and Goldman Sachs (GS-9.14%) to right its business, including by potentially splitting its foundry division. Broadcom (AVGO-10.34%) is reportedly looking to buy Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-6.87%) is eyeing Intel’s chip manufacturing plants. Intel’s former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted in December, had helmed an initiative to revamp the company’s foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips. Tan in his speech, also committed to build out the chips foundry business. “Global demand for chip production is growing, and you need supply chains that are flexible, resilient, and secure. Intel foundry plays a crucial role. We will continue to advance our foundry strategy to meet your needs,” Tan said. Other top priorities for Intel going forward will be to retain and recruit top engineering talent and to return to its roots of “an engineering-first company,” Tan said. Tan also emphasized that he would like to see Intel act more like a startup. “Most importantly, we will simplify the way we work. Bureaucracy kills innovation. In my career, I’ve seen how small, focused teams can move very fast and innovate and take on incumbents, and we’re going to practice that in Intel,” Tan said.

Title: It's not just tariffs. 4 other issues are battering stock market sentiment.

Time Published: 2025-04-01T14:35:05Z
Full Content:
Trump's trade war isn't the only thing that's derailed the stock market in 2025. While anticipated tariffs have exerted the most pressure in recent weeks, the sell-off has been accelerated by a slew of data points that suggest that the economy is on shaky footing. Here are four factors that are souring the mood among investors as the second quarter kicks off. Consumers are feeling steadily worse about the state of the economy. Consumer confidence dropped for the fourth month in a row in March, hitting its lowest level since 2021, according to the latest Conference Board Survey. The Expectations Index, a broad measure of how consumers feel about the outlook for income, business activity, and the job market, dropped to 65.1 this month, its lowest level in 12 years. That's below a key level of 80, a threshold that has typically signaled a coming recession. CEOs aren't feeling very chipper, either. According to a survey conducted by Chief Executive Group, on average, chief executives rated business conditions in March around 20% lower than conditions in January. Meanwhile, the outlook among CEOs for what business conditions will look like 12 months from now dropped 28% from levels in January, the most pessimistic business leaders have been since 2012, the firm said. The downbeat mood is palpable, and Wall Street is taking notice. "In the US, there is a clear crisis of confidence," Manish Kabra, the head of US equity strategy at Societe Generale, wrote in a note on Tuesday. "Events so far this year have led us to highlight our negative views on the Nasdaq-100 and to underline that trade uncertainty is driving our trading call for the S&P 500 to fall to 5555. Most of these events are 'known knowns'. The high-flying AI stocks that have boosted the market in recent years aren't doing so well in 2025. Even before the stiffest tariff headwinds shook up the stock market, investors were questioning the longevity of the trade. In January, DeepSeek, an AI tool from China, surprised markets with a more cost-efficient model to rival US peers like ChatGPT. Since then, investors have been left wondering why the AI "hyperscalers" — companies with big AI ambitions like Meta Platforms and Amazon — have been spending so heavily on chips and other tech. More importantly, they're wondering when they might see a return on such massive capex related to AI. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which has near-equal positions in all the Magnificent Seven stocks, is down 15% year-to-date. By the end of last week, ever Magnificent Seven stock was negative for the year, with Meta the last of the cohort to give up its gains. Doubts have also been swirling for months on whether top AI firms, like Nvidia, will be able to keep up their chip sales in the coming years. "At the top of our list of concerns is the potential for excess comput as well as harsher than expected tariffs and/or export restrictions. We think the keys to the next major move in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks will depend on clarity from tariffs," Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note on Monday. Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, with Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred measure, accelerating 2.8% in February, up from the prior month's 2.5% yearly increase. Hotter inflation is bad news on two fronts. For one, it could mean the Fed has less room to cut interest rates this year, meaning interest-rate pressure will continue to weigh on stocks. For another, higher inflation is raising fears of stagflation, a worst-case economic scenario that describes a slowing economy with stubbornly high prices. Such a case is even harder for the Fed to deal with than a typical recession, as central bankers won't be able to cut rates to boost the economy without stoking higher prices. In a March Bank of America survey, 71% of fund managers said they saw the risk that the global economy would see stagflation within the next 12 months. The survey also found record stock selling among fund managers, with investors' allocation to the US stock market dropping to their lowest levels in about two years. "Faced with modest stagflation, we think the Fed will stay on hold," strategists said in a note. "Risks are skewed toward weaker growth and even higher inflation." Hiring isn't as strong as it's been in recent years. On top of that, DOGE-related cuts as the government pursues vast budget reduction plans is drumming up uncertainty about future jobs data. The unemployment rate remained at a historically low 4.1% in February, but continued jobless claims have climbed steadily over the past year, according to data from the US Employment and Training Administration. Layoffs also appear to be accelerating. US employers announced 172,017 job cuts in February, a 245% increase from job cuts announced the prior month, and a 103% increase from cuts announced in February of last year, according to data from Challenger, Gray, & Christmas. A weaker job market is stoking fears of a potential recession in 2025, which more forecasters on Wall Street have voiced in recent weeks. In a recent note, strategists from Goldman Sachs lowered their forecast for GDP growth while raising their forecast for unemployment and the probability of a recession this year. "We raised our 12-month recession probability from 20% to 35%, reflecting our lower growth forecast, falling confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating willingness to tolerate economic pain," the bank wrote in a note.

The government has put Ola Cabs (ANI Technologies Private Ltd) and Uber (Uber India Systems Pvt. Ltd) under scrutiny after confirming in the Lok Sabha on 12 March that the cab aggregators have allegedly been charging different fares based on a phone’s operating system. The issue, flagged by members of parliament (MPs), raised concerns over algorithm-driven pricing models that may be discriminating against users depending on whether they book rides from an iPhone or an Android device.

In response to a question raised by MPs Balashowry Vallabhaneni and Ravindra Chavan, Union minister for consumer affairs Pralhad Joshi informed the Lower House that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) had taken note of complaints about the alleged fare disparity and issued notices to Uber and Ola on 10 January 2025, seeking an explanation. "It has come to the notice of the Department of Consumer Affairs that ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd (Ola) and Uber India Systems Pvt. Ltd (Uber) are allegedly following price disparity for cab fares displayed on Android and iOS devices for identical rides," the minister said in the Lok Sabha.

Complaints suggest that for the same ride—with identical pick-up and drop locations, estimated travel time, and conditions—users booking via iPhones are being charged more than those using Android devices. If proven true, such differential pricing could be classified as an unfair trade practice under India’s consumer protection laws, specifically the Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 2020, under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provisions. Also Read | Inside Ola Electric’s showdown with registration agencies The government has been tightening regulations in the digital marketplace, particularly with the E-commerce Rules 2020, which bar platforms from manipulating prices or engaging in discriminatory pricing based on arbitrary factors. The case is expected to test the extent to which Indian regulators can enforce transparency in digital services, where algorithms dictate pricing models. On 23 January, Mint reported that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) had issued a notice to Apple Inc. about alleged performance issues in specific iPhone models following a software update. According to the report, the CCPA, which functions under the department of consumer affairs, also sent notices to ride-hailing platforms Ola and Uber after receiving complaints about fare differences based on users' phone models. The notices to Apple, Ola, and Uber are part of the government's broader efforts to regulate digital and tech platforms in India. CCPA aims to address consumer grievances and ensure fair business practices, strengthening consumer confidence in the digital marketplace. The watchdog has also taken action against electric vehicle manufacturers, coaching institutes, travel-booking platforms, online marketplaces, consumer durables companies, influencers, and celebrities for misleading consumers or engaging in deceptive sales practices.

U.S. stock futures point lower as investors continue to monitor tariff announcements from the White House after President Donald Trump said that decisions on tomorrow's reciprocal tariffs have been made; OpenAI announces a $40 billion funding round led by Japan's SoftBank that values the ChatGPT maker at $300 billion; Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly warns firms that their CHIPS Act funding could be cut if they don't increase U.S. investments; and Moderna (MRNA) shares are in focus after plummeting yesterday following the resignation of a top FDA official. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing lower after indexes recovered from early losses Monday as investors await tariff updates. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are 0.6% lower after the blue-chip index jumped 1% yesterday. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are pointing lower by a similar percentage. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is up about 2% to trade above $84,000. Gold futures are rising to another all-time high, and oil futures are ticking higher. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are falling. President Donald Trump said he has decided on tariffs to be announced tomorrow for what he called "Liberation Day." The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's decisions focused on enacting a 20% tariff on all U.S. imports or applying reciprocal tariffs that match those on U.S. exports. Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) said it was ready to apply retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. if negotiations to avoid the increased import taxes were unsuccessful. OpenAI announced it has closed a $40 billion funding round that raises the ChatGPT parent's valuation to $300 billion. Japan's SoftBank is leading the founding round with up to $30 billion in investments, with another $10 billion coming from a syndicate. SoftBank's total investment depends on whether OpenAI transforms into a for-profit company before year's end. OpenAI said it would use the funding to "push the frontiers of AI research even further, scale our compute infrastructure, and deliver increasingly powerful tools." Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly is pressing chipmakers set to receive federal funding to expand their U.S. production or face funding cuts. According to Bloomberg, Lutnick has warned firms receiving 2022 CHIPS and Science Act funding that it could be cut if they don't expand the size of their U.S. investments. Lutnick cited a recent announcement by chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) to invest $100 billion in U.S.-based chip manufacturing facilities. Moderna (MRNA) shares are in focus after plummeting yesterday following the resignation of a top U.S. healthcare official over vaccine policy. Moderna stock fell almost 9% to hit a five-year low on the resignation of Food and Drug Administration's vaccine chief, Peter Marks, who cited conflicts with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Moderna shares, which are little changed in premarket trading, are down 95% from their August 2021 peak driven by demand for their COVID-19 vaccine.

Title: Tesla, Nvidia, CoreWeave, Calvin Klein's parent PVH, XPeng: Stocks to watch

Stock edged lower on Tuesday after economic indicators showed further softening ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement on Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% as of 10:10 a.m, Nasdaq Composite slid 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1%. The ISM manufacturing index fell by more than expected in March to 49.0 from 50.3 in February, with the new orders reading dropping to 45.2 from 48.6. A number under 50 indicates a contraction. The JOLTS job opening tally fell by more than expected in February, to 7.57 million. On the upside, construction spending rebounded by more than projected in February as weather improved. Investors are listening for any hints about Trump’s unveiling of import taxes. The announcement will focus on “country-based” duties, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday, and while the president still plans sectoral tariffs, they won’t be the focus of Wednesday’s event. Trump said Sunday that he plans to start reciprocal tariffs with “all countries,” countering speculation he might limit the initial scope of his April 2 announcement, Bloomberg reported. Be on the lookout for hoaxes — it’s April Fools Day. Here are some stocks to watch today: CoreWeave rebounded, rising 2.3% following Monday’s 7.3% decline in its second day of trading after its underwhelming IPO. The tepid market reception may be a sign that hype over AI is subsiding. Nvidia (NVDA-7.00%) fell about 0.8%. Ford’s (F-5.37%) stock fell about 1.3% after it said that its first-quarter sales fell 1.3%. Sales of electric vehicles and hybrids gained 26% to a record. PVH’s stock surged 17% after the owner of the Calvin Klein (PVH-15.78%) and Tommy Hilfiger brands projected that sales would be flat to slightly higher this fiscal year compared with last. The consensus analyst forecast had been for a decline, according to FactSet. Tesla (TSLA-5.86%) shares gained 1% after declining 1.7% on Monday. The company’s first-quarter sales, due Wednesday, will probably disappoint investors, analysts said, with some trimming their forecasts to below 400,000 units. Xiaomi’s (XIACF+3.30%) ADRs plunged 7.4% after the Chinese EV maker confirmed reports that one of its SU7 models had been involved in a crash on an expressway in China, Bloomberg reported. Local media said that three people died in the accident. XPeng’s (XPEV-0.33%) U.S.-traded shares gained 1.1% after the Chinese EV-maker said its deliveries surged 268% in March from a year earlier to 33,205 units. Quarterly sales jumped 331%.

Title: The 10 Richest People In Latin America 2025

ByGigi Zamora ByGigi Zamora, Forbes Staff. There are a record-breaking 3,028 billionaires around the world, but only 95 hail from Latin America, down from 110 a year ago. This group of entrepreneurs, investors and heirs are worth a combined $484.3 billion, $46 billion less than in 2024. Brazil, which has the highest number of billionaires in the region, contributed largely to the decline, as the country faces economic headwinds and wrestles to combat inflation. Of the region’s 18 drop-offs, 15 were from Brazil, most notably including “Soybean King” Blairo Maggi, controlling shareholder of soybean producer Amaggi, and João Alves de Queiroz Filho, founder of Hypera Pharma. The country did manage to add two new faces this year, however, in Anheuser-Busch InBev heir Max Van Hoegaerden Herrmann Telles (estimated net worth: $5.8 billion) and renewable energies entrepreneur Mário Araripe ($3 billion). While Brazil lost the most billionaires in Latin America over the past year, Mexican billionaires lost the most money. A weakened peso—down 20% against the U.S. dollar—and a barrage of tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have helped push the combined wealth of Mexico’s richest people down by $36.9 billion, to an aggregate $167.1 billion. No one in the region lost more than Carlos Slim Helú ($82.5 billion), who shed $19.5 billion of his net worth, as shares of his telecommunications company América Móvil and his conglomerate Grupo Carso fell by 20% and 15%, respectively, amid exchange rate fluctuations; he dropped from No. 14 to No. 19 worldwide. Ricardo Salinas Pliego ($4.9 billion), who ranked last year as the seventh richest individual in the region and the third richest in Mexico, lost $8.5 billion as shares of his conglomerate Grupo Elektra plummeted 70% amid trading suspensions stemming from fraud allegations and debt disputes between Salinas’ companies and the Mexican government. To mitigate the drop in value, Grupo Elektra’s board decided to take the company private in late 2024; the transition is expected to be completed by May. Meanwhile, siblings Juan Domingo ($1.9 billion) and Karen Beckmann Legorreta ($1.3 billion), lost $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, as shares of Becle, the company behind the Jose Cuervo tequila brand, fell to a record low on March 4th, when tariffs for imports from Mexico, Canada and China went into effect. They were suspended two days later, but the stock has yet to rebound. Outside of Mexico and Brazil, things weren’t as grim. Strong performance from financial institutions brought an Argentinian banker (Delfín Jorge Ezequiel Carballo, $1.2 billion) and a Chilean banker (Luis Enrique Yarur Rey, $1.3 billion) back into the ranking, and upped the fortune of Venezuela’s richest person, Juan Carlos Escotet ($7.4 billion), by 68%. Another returnee is Eduardo Hochschild ($2.4 billion), chairman of the Peru-based family business Hochschild Group. The only Peruvian citizen on the list, he returns after an uptick in the group’s mining company stock price thanks to a return to profitability in 2024 and some hefty dividend payouts. Two notable Latin American billionaires died this year. Gregorio Pérez Companc, who transformed Grupo Perez Companc into one of Argentina’s largest conglomerates, died in June 2024. The tycoon had planned his succession in 2009 when he gave six of his children equal shares in the conglomerate's holding company. This year, three of the siblings bought out the rest. Luis, Rosario and Pilar Perez Companc are now the majority owners but none were individual billionaires when we finalized the list. And Chilean Horst Paulmann passed away in March. Paulmann founded retail giant Cencosud from a single supermarket in central Chile in 1963. When he died, the company had a presence in five countries in Latin America and brought in $17.5 billion in annual revenue. In 2022, he and his five siblings inherited their late father’s stake in Grupo BAL, a Mexican conglomerate that spans mining, retail and financial services. In June, Carlos Slim Helú’s Grupo Carso completed the acquisition of PetroBal Upstream, the group’s oil arm, for some $530 million. AFP via Getty Images Now Mexico’s third-richest person, Aramburuzabala inherited her father’s stake in beer producer Grupo Modelo following his 1995 death from lung cancer. Her fortune includes her sister’s and mom's shares in Tresalia Capital, the family’s investment vehicle, which has backed companies like Tory Burch and Casper Sleep. Aramburuzabala’s net worth is up by $2.7 billion this year after Forbes dug into the value of Tresalia’s real estate portfolio. Gabriel Rinaldi for Forbes In August, Velez sold 31 million shares of Nu Holdings, worth $404 million. The cofounder and CEO, who still owns 20% of the company’s stock, has big plans for Latin America’s largest fintech company. In January, he discussed plans to expand Nubank’s operations beyond the region, including a potential entry into the United States. The Colombian banker, who ties Velez for the title of the country’s richest person, built his fortune through a series of bold banking acquisitions and successful exits across Latin America. His latest deals: London-based Metro Bank, of which he became majority shareholder in 2023 and Colombian food processing conglomerate Grupo Nutresa. Gilinski, who had been increasing his stake in Grupo Nutresa since 2021, bought an additional 12% last year alongside his partner, Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Company. Getty Images Lemann cofounded private equity firm 3G Capital with fellow billionaires Carlos “Beto” Sicupira and Marcel Herrmann Telles in 2004, making highly lucrative and long-hold investments into food and beverage companies like Anheuser-Busch, H.J. Heinz & Company and Burger King. In recent years, the firm has ventured into other industries, including a 75% stake in Dutch window blinds maker Hunter Douglas. The inheritance saga plaguing the widow and children of Joseph Safra, once the richest banker in the world, has come to an end. "I am happy to put that matter behind. After clarifications, I understood that there were no wrongdoings, and that Mr. Safra's estate was properly disposed in accordance to his wishes,” son Alberto said in a joint statement with the family released in July. Alberto had previously sued his mother and siblings, claiming his stake in Safra National Bank of New York had been diluted after his father's passing. The widow of Andrónico Luksic (d. 2005) and his children are reportedly seeking nearly $230 million from Banco Santander and PwC related to losses from Banco Popular’s near-bankruptcy in 2017. Through Aeris Invest, the family had put around $125 million into Banco Popular shortly before Santander acquired it for just one euro after it was declared failing by the European Central Bank. Larrea built his fortune by expanding Grupo Mexico into a conglomerate with interests in transportation and infrastructure. The mining mogul, who took over as president and CEO in 1994, is one of only three Mexicans whose fortunes are up this year as the conglomerate’s revenue rose by nearly 13%, to $16.2 billion. Grupo Mexico’s mining division reported record revenues thanks to higher copper production and strong market conditions. Bryan van der Beek for Forbes The Facebook cofounder continues to reap the benefits of his Meta stake. Saverin’s wealth has increased by $6.5 billion as Meta’s stock continues to surge. Saverin, who resides in Singapore, topped Forbes’ Singapore’s 50 Richest list in September. Three months later, he and his wife donated $15 million to the Singapore American School. Martin Schoeller for Forbes Although he’s still among the world’s top 20 richest people, Slim’s drop to No. 19 overall marks the lowest he’s ranked since 2003. While shares of his biggest companies, América Móvil and Grupo Carso, were down over the past year, the telecommunications magnate has poured $1 billion into U.S. oil companies Talos Energy and PBF Energy.

Title: The $100 Billion Club: These 15 People Have 12-Figure Fortunes

ByMatt Durot ByMatt Durot, Forbes Staff. T he ultra-elite echelon of people with dozen-digit fortunes didn’t even exist eight years ago. Now, a record 15 people make the grade on Forbes’ 2025 World’s Billionaires list, up from 14 last year and six in 2023. For the first time, three of them have a net worth above $200 billion. In all, these 15 “centibillionaires” are worth $2.4 trillion, nearly $400 billion more than a year ago—and more than the planet’s 1,500 “poorest” billionaires combined. Put another way, this group of just 0.5% of the world’s 3,028 billionaires holds an incredible 15% of all billionaire wealth. In 1987, when Forbes published its first ever global rich list, the idea of a centibillionaire was hard to imagine. We found just two people, both Japanese tycoons, worth more than $10 billion (about $28 billion adjusted for inflation, good enough to rank just 71st on the 2025 list). It took the dot-com bubble to create the first centibillionaire, Bill Gates, whose Microsoft shares briefly lifted his fortune above $100 billion in 1999, before the ensuing crash chopped his net worth nearly in half. No one else came close for nearly two decades, even as markets soared before and after the Great Recession. Jeff Bezos finally cracked the code in late 2017, becoming the second ever centibillionaire, when Amazon’s market capitalization rocketed toward $1 trillion. Still, it wasn’t until 2021 that the $100 Billion Club expanded beyond Bezos, when Elon Musk, Bernard Arnault and Bill Gates joined its ranks. Now, with extreme affluence surging around the world, membership is getting (just a little bit) more common by the day. The three living children of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992) all joined the $100 Billion Club this year, replacing two members on last year’s list whose fortunes dropped back into 11 figures: Indian industrial tycoon Mukesh Ambani (estimated net worth: $92.5 billion) and Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu ($82.5 billion). Meanwhile, a number of other billionaires are knocking on the door, led by Nvidia’s Jensen Huang ($98.7 billion), tech tycoon Michael Dell ($97.7 billion) and L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers ($81.6 billion), who briefly became the first-ever female centibillionaire in June 2024. In September, Walton became the world’s wealthiest woman once again, overtaking French L’Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, who had surpassed her for the previous two and a half years. The Walmart heiress is best known for spearheading the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in her family’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. She has given away an estimated $1.7 billion, including a recent gift of $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, also in Bentonville. The cofounder of financial data and media company Bloomberg LP donated $1 billion to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, last July to make its medical school tuition free for most students. Altogether he has given $4.6 billion to the school, which announced in March that it will lay off more than 2,000 employees after the Trump administration canceled $800 million of federal grants. The Microsoft cofounder hasn’t ranked this low since 1991, when he was worth $4.4 billion. Microsoft stock is down 2% since last year, but the main reason for Gates’ $20 billion drop is Forbes’ increased estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement, which we peg at $25 billion. In his capacity as chairman of the $70 billion (net assets) Gates Foundation, he met with Trump in February to advocate for the U.S. Agency for International Development after the administration started slashing its workforce and programs. The self-described nerd also barnstormed the country that month, appearing on the Today show, The Tonight Show (and everything in between) to promote his recently published childhood memoir, Source Code. Three decades after Walmart founder Sam Walton’s death, his children are stepping back. In June, Rob, 80, retired from the retailing giant’s board after more than 40 years as a director. Jim, 76, left the board in 2016, but still chairs the family’s Arvest Bank Group. In December, the Waltons announced that all eight of Sam’s grandkids now share in the voting rights for the family’s 45% stake in Walmart. Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft 11 years ago but still raves about the stock, which accounts for an estimated 80% of his portfolio. It’s been a heck of an investment: MSFT shares have returned nearly 1,200% since he left the top job, quadrupling the S&P 500. Ballmer is also very emotionally invested in the L.A. Clippers, the basketball team he bought for $2 billion in 2014. Now moved into the shiny new Intuit Dome stadium that Ballmer spent some $2 billion building, it’s the NBA’s fifth most valuable team, worth $5.5 billion. Spain’s richest person has invested more than $1 billion in logistics and office properties across Europe over the past year. He can afford it: His stake in fashion retail giant Inditex, which he founded in 1985 and is best known for its Zara brand, is worth a record $100 billion, as shares swelled 27% over the past 12 months. Plus Ortega, who stepped down as chairman 14 years ago, has another $3.4 billion (pretax) coming his way, too, thanks to a fat dividend announced in March. The Alphabet cofounders and board members are richer this year due to a nearly 30% jump in Alphabet shares—despite the Justice Department’s demand that Google be broken up. Brin has reportedly been back in the office working on Alphabet’s Gemini family of AI models, and reportedly encouraged employees to do the same, penning a February memo urging in-office attendance. Page, meanwhile, is reportedly working on a new company to apply AI to manufacturing. The 94-year-old investor has amassed $334 billion of cash on Berkshire Hathaway’s books—and is in no hurry to spend it. Buffett was a net seller of $134 billion of equities in 2024 and hasn’t made a splashy acquisition since 2022’s $11.5 billion purchase of insurer Alleghany Corp. “Often, nothing looks compelling,” Buffett wrote in his annual shareholder letter in February. The richest person on the planet a year ago, Arnault has seen his fortune drop by $55 billion amid what the luxury goods giant has called “a challenging economic and geopolitical environment.” The 76-year-old father of five (all LVMH executives) seems to be having fun keeping everyone guessing as to his successor: Son Antoine was center stage for the group’s sponsorship of last summer’s Paris Olympics; son Frédéric was recently named chief of its Loro Piana fashion brand; and daughter Delphine and son Alexandre were seated with their father at Trump’s inauguration. Ellison wasn’t one of the tech tycoons front and center at Trump’s inauguration, but the next day he stood feet away from the president at the White House as Trump announced a $500 billion initiative to build AI infrastructure, including data centers, backed in part by Ellison’s firm Oracle. Ellison’s fortune is up $51 billion from 2024 due to a 40% rise in Oracle’s stock price. The Amazon founder and chairman is $21 billion richer than last year and keeping busy as an investor. Bezos, who offloaded $5 billion of Amazon shares over the past 12 months, has continued to pump cash into startups, including several AI robotics firms. His space outfit, Blue Origin, announced in February that it’s laying off 10% of its workforce, a month after the successful launch of its New Glenn rocket. Meanwhile his recent moves at another toy, the Washington Post, including declaring that the opinion pages must support “personal liberties and free markets,” have ruffled establishment feathers. The formerly progressive Meta CEO surprised many with his public embrace of MAGA, including putting pro-Trump entrepreneur Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, on Meta’s board in early January and cohosting an inauguration reception for the president alongside several Republican billionaires. Shares of the social media behemoth have surged nearly 25% over the past year amid optimism about Meta’s AI investments—enough to make Zuck the planet’s second-richest person for the first time. Musk reclaimed the title of world’s richest person from LVMH’s Bernard Arnault last May, when private investors valued Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, at $24 billion. Then, in December, he became the first person ever worth $400 billion, after xAI’s valuation doubled to $50 billion and Musk’s rocket maker, SpaceX, hit $350 billion (up from $210 billion in June). Shares of his EV company, Tesla, also reached an all-time high that month, but the stock has crashed by nearly 40% since inauguration day, when Musk took over as head of President Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Still, he’s worth $147 billion more than a year ago. And that’s before Musk announced last Friday that xAI had acquired his social media company X (formerly Twitter) in a deal that valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, or roughly what Musk paid for the platform in 2022.

Title: The 10 Richest People In Latin America 2025

ByGigi Zamora ByGigi Zamora, Forbes Staff. There are a record-breaking 3,028 billionaires around the world, but only 95 hail from Latin America, down from 110 a year ago. This group of entrepreneurs, investors and heirs are worth a combined $484.3 billion, $46 billion less than in 2024. Brazil, which has the highest number of billionaires in the region, contributed largely to the decline, as the country faces economic headwinds and wrestles to combat inflation. Of the region’s 18 drop-offs, 15 were from Brazil, most notably including “Soybean King” Blairo Maggi, controlling shareholder of soybean producer Amaggi, and João Alves de Queiroz Filho, founder of Hypera Pharma. The country did manage to add two new faces this year, however, in Anheuser-Busch InBev heir Max Van Hoegaerden Herrmann Telles (estimated net worth: $5.8 billion) and renewable energies entrepreneur Mário Araripe ($3 billion). While Brazil lost the most billionaires in Latin America over the past year, Mexican billionaires lost the most money. A weakened peso—down 20% against the U.S. dollar—and a barrage of tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have helped push the combined wealth of Mexico’s richest people down by $36.9 billion, to an aggregate $167.1 billion. No one in the region lost more than Carlos Slim Helú ($82.5 billion), who shed $19.5 billion of his net worth, as shares of his telecommunications company América Móvil and his conglomerate Grupo Carso fell by 20% and 15%, respectively, amid exchange rate fluctuations; he dropped from No. 14 to No. 19 worldwide. Ricardo Salinas Pliego ($4.9 billion), who ranked last year as the seventh richest individual in the region and the third richest in Mexico, lost $8.5 billion as shares of his conglomerate Grupo Elektra plummeted 70% amid trading suspensions stemming from fraud allegations and debt disputes between Salinas’ companies and the Mexican government. To mitigate the drop in value, Grupo Elektra’s board decided to take the company private in late 2024; the transition is expected to be completed by May. Meanwhile, siblings Juan Domingo ($1.9 billion) and Karen Beckmann Legorreta ($1.3 billion), lost $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, as shares of Becle, the company behind the Jose Cuervo tequila brand, fell to a record low on March 4th, when tariffs for imports from Mexico, Canada and China went into effect. They were suspended two days later, but the stock has yet to rebound. Outside of Mexico and Brazil, things weren’t as grim. Strong performance from financial institutions brought an Argentinian banker (Delfín Jorge Ezequiel Carballo, $1.2 billion) and a Chilean banker (Luis Enrique Yarur Rey, $1.3 billion) back into the ranking, and upped the fortune of Venezuela’s richest person, Juan Carlos Escotet ($7.4 billion), by 68%. Another returnee is Eduardo Hochschild ($2.4 billion), chairman of the Peru-based family business Hochschild Group. The only Peruvian citizen on the list, he returns after an uptick in the group’s mining company stock price thanks to a return to profitability in 2024 and some hefty dividend payouts. Two notable Latin American billionaires died this year. Gregorio Pérez Companc, who transformed Grupo Perez Companc into one of Argentina’s largest conglomerates, died in June 2024. The tycoon had planned his succession in 2009 when he gave six of his children equal shares in the conglomerate's holding company. This year, three of the siblings bought out the rest. Luis, Rosario and Pilar Perez Companc are now the majority owners but none were individual billionaires when we finalized the list. And Chilean Horst Paulmann passed away in March. Paulmann founded retail giant Cencosud from a single supermarket in central Chile in 1963. When he died, the company had a presence in five countries in Latin America and brought in $17.5 billion in annual revenue. In 2022, he and his five siblings inherited their late father’s stake in Grupo BAL, a Mexican conglomerate that spans mining, retail and financial services. In June, Carlos Slim Helú’s Grupo Carso completed the acquisition of PetroBal Upstream, the group’s oil arm, for some $530 million. AFP via Getty Images Now Mexico’s third-richest person, Aramburuzabala inherited her father’s stake in beer producer Grupo Modelo following his 1995 death from lung cancer. Her fortune includes her sister’s and mom's shares in Tresalia Capital, the family’s investment vehicle, which has backed companies like Tory Burch and Casper Sleep. Aramburuzabala’s net worth is up by $2.7 billion this year after Forbes dug into the value of Tresalia’s real estate portfolio. Gabriel Rinaldi for Forbes In August, Velez sold 31 million shares of Nu Holdings, worth $404 million. The cofounder and CEO, who still owns 20% of the company’s stock, has big plans for Latin America’s largest fintech company. In January, he discussed plans to expand Nubank’s operations beyond the region, including a potential entry into the United States. The Colombian banker, who ties Velez for the title of the country’s richest person, built his fortune through a series of bold banking acquisitions and successful exits across Latin America. His latest deals: London-based Metro Bank, of which he became majority shareholder in 2023 and Colombian food processing conglomerate Grupo Nutresa. Gilinski, who had been increasing his stake in Grupo Nutresa since 2021, bought an additional 12% last year alongside his partner, Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Company. Getty Images Lemann cofounded private equity firm 3G Capital with fellow billionaires Carlos “Beto” Sicupira and Marcel Herrmann Telles in 2004, making highly lucrative and long-hold investments into food and beverage companies like Anheuser-Busch, H.J. Heinz & Company and Burger King. In recent years, the firm has ventured into other industries, including a 75% stake in Dutch window blinds maker Hunter Douglas. The inheritance saga plaguing the widow and children of Joseph Safra, once the richest banker in the world, has come to an end. "I am happy to put that matter behind. After clarifications, I understood that there were no wrongdoings, and that Mr. Safra's estate was properly disposed in accordance to his wishes,” son Alberto said in a joint statement with the family released in July. Alberto had previously sued his mother and siblings, claiming his stake in Safra National Bank of New York had been diluted after his father's passing. The widow of Andrónico Luksic (d. 2005) and his children are reportedly seeking nearly $230 million from Banco Santander and PwC related to losses from Banco Popular’s near-bankruptcy in 2017. Through Aeris Invest, the family had put around $125 million into Banco Popular shortly before Santander acquired it for just one euro after it was declared failing by the European Central Bank. Larrea built his fortune by expanding Grupo Mexico into a conglomerate with interests in transportation and infrastructure. The mining mogul, who took over as president and CEO in 1994, is one of only three Mexicans whose fortunes are up this year as the conglomerate’s revenue rose by nearly 13%, to $16.2 billion. Grupo Mexico’s mining division reported record revenues thanks to higher copper production and strong market conditions. Bryan van der Beek for Forbes The Facebook cofounder continues to reap the benefits of his Meta stake. Saverin’s wealth has increased by $6.5 billion as Meta’s stock continues to surge. Saverin, who resides in Singapore, topped Forbes’ Singapore’s 50 Richest list in September. Three months later, he and his wife donated $15 million to the Singapore American School. Martin Schoeller for Forbes Although he’s still among the world’s top 20 richest people, Slim’s drop to No. 19 overall marks the lowest he’s ranked since 2003. While shares of his biggest companies, América Móvil and Grupo Carso, were down over the past year, the telecommunications magnate has poured $1 billion into U.S. oil companies Talos Energy and PBF Energy.

Title: The $100 Billion Club: These 15 People Have 12-Figure Fortunes

ByMatt Durot ByMatt Durot, Forbes Staff. T he ultra-elite echelon of people with dozen-digit fortunes didn’t even exist eight years ago. Now, a record 15 people make the grade on Forbes’ 2025 World’s Billionaires list, up from 14 last year and six in 2023. For the first time, three of them have a net worth above $200 billion. In all, these 15 “centibillionaires” are worth $2.4 trillion, nearly $400 billion more than a year ago—and more than the planet’s 1,500 “poorest” billionaires combined. Put another way, this group of just 0.5% of the world’s 3,028 billionaires holds an incredible 15% of all billionaire wealth. In 1987, when Forbes published its first ever global rich list, the idea of a centibillionaire was hard to imagine. We found just two people, both Japanese tycoons, worth more than $10 billion (about $28 billion adjusted for inflation, good enough to rank just 71st on the 2025 list). It took the dot-com bubble to create the first centibillionaire, Bill Gates, whose Microsoft shares briefly lifted his fortune above $100 billion in 1999, before the ensuing crash chopped his net worth nearly in half. No one else came close for nearly two decades, even as markets soared before and after the Great Recession. Jeff Bezos finally cracked the code in late 2017, becoming the second ever centibillionaire, when Amazon’s market capitalization rocketed toward $1 trillion. Still, it wasn’t until 2021 that the $100 Billion Club expanded beyond Bezos, when Elon Musk, Bernard Arnault and Bill Gates joined its ranks. Now, with extreme affluence surging around the world, membership is getting (just a little bit) more common by the day. The three living children of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992) all joined the $100 Billion Club this year, replacing two members on last year’s list whose fortunes dropped back into 11 figures: Indian industrial tycoon Mukesh Ambani (estimated net worth: $92.5 billion) and Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu ($82.5 billion). Meanwhile, a number of other billionaires are knocking on the door, led by Nvidia’s Jensen Huang ($98.7 billion), tech tycoon Michael Dell ($97.7 billion) and L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers ($81.6 billion), who briefly became the first-ever female centibillionaire in June 2024. In September, Walton became the world’s wealthiest woman once again, overtaking French L’Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, who had surpassed her for the previous two and a half years. The Walmart heiress is best known for spearheading the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in her family’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. She has given away an estimated $1.7 billion, including a recent gift of $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, also in Bentonville. The cofounder of financial data and media company Bloomberg LP donated $1 billion to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, last July to make its medical school tuition free for most students. Altogether he has given $4.6 billion to the school, which announced in March that it will lay off more than 2,000 employees after the Trump administration canceled $800 million of federal grants. The Microsoft cofounder hasn’t ranked this low since 1991, when he was worth $4.4 billion. Microsoft stock is down 2% since last year, but the main reason for Gates’ $20 billion drop is Forbes’ increased estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement, which we peg at $25 billion. In his capacity as chairman of the $70 billion (net assets) Gates Foundation, he met with Trump in February to advocate for the U.S. Agency for International Development after the administration started slashing its workforce and programs. The self-described nerd also barnstormed the country that month, appearing on the Today show, The Tonight Show (and everything in between) to promote his recently published childhood memoir, Source Code. Three decades after Walmart founder Sam Walton’s death, his children are stepping back. In June, Rob, 80, retired from the retailing giant’s board after more than 40 years as a director. Jim, 76, left the board in 2016, but still chairs the family’s Arvest Bank Group. In December, the Waltons announced that all eight of Sam’s grandkids now share in the voting rights for the family’s 45% stake in Walmart. Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft 11 years ago but still raves about the stock, which accounts for an estimated 80% of his portfolio. It’s been a heck of an investment: MSFT shares have returned nearly 1,200% since he left the top job, quadrupling the S&P 500. Ballmer is also very emotionally invested in the L.A. Clippers, the basketball team he bought for $2 billion in 2014. Now moved into the shiny new Intuit Dome stadium that Ballmer spent some $2 billion building, it’s the NBA’s fifth most valuable team, worth $5.5 billion. Spain’s richest person has invested more than $1 billion in logistics and office properties across Europe over the past year. He can afford it: His stake in fashion retail giant Inditex, which he founded in 1985 and is best known for its Zara brand, is worth a record $100 billion, as shares swelled 27% over the past 12 months. Plus Ortega, who stepped down as chairman 14 years ago, has another $3.4 billion (pretax) coming his way, too, thanks to a fat dividend announced in March. The Alphabet cofounders and board members are richer this year due to a nearly 30% jump in Alphabet shares—despite the Justice Department’s demand that Google be broken up. Brin has reportedly been back in the office working on Alphabet’s Gemini family of AI models, and reportedly encouraged employees to do the same, penning a February memo urging in-office attendance. Page, meanwhile, is reportedly working on a new company to apply AI to manufacturing. The 94-year-old investor has amassed $334 billion of cash on Berkshire Hathaway’s books—and is in no hurry to spend it. Buffett was a net seller of $134 billion of equities in 2024 and hasn’t made a splashy acquisition since 2022’s $11.5 billion purchase of insurer Alleghany Corp. “Often, nothing looks compelling,” Buffett wrote in his annual shareholder letter in February. The richest person on the planet a year ago, Arnault has seen his fortune drop by $55 billion amid what the luxury goods giant has called “a challenging economic and geopolitical environment.” The 76-year-old father of five (all LVMH executives) seems to be having fun keeping everyone guessing as to his successor: Son Antoine was center stage for the group’s sponsorship of last summer’s Paris Olympics; son Frédéric was recently named chief of its Loro Piana fashion brand; and daughter Delphine and son Alexandre were seated with their father at Trump’s inauguration. Ellison wasn’t one of the tech tycoons front and center at Trump’s inauguration, but the next day he stood feet away from the president at the White House as Trump announced a $500 billion initiative to build AI infrastructure, including data centers, backed in part by Ellison’s firm Oracle. Ellison’s fortune is up $51 billion from 2024 due to a 40% rise in Oracle’s stock price. The Amazon founder and chairman is $21 billion richer than last year and keeping busy as an investor. Bezos, who offloaded $5 billion of Amazon shares over the past 12 months, has continued to pump cash into startups, including several AI robotics firms. His space outfit, Blue Origin, announced in February that it’s laying off 10% of its workforce, a month after the successful launch of its New Glenn rocket. Meanwhile his recent moves at another toy, the Washington Post, including declaring that the opinion pages must support “personal liberties and free markets,” have ruffled establishment feathers. The formerly progressive Meta CEO surprised many with his public embrace of MAGA, including putting pro-Trump entrepreneur Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, on Meta’s board in early January and cohosting an inauguration reception for the president alongside several Republican billionaires. Shares of the social media behemoth have surged nearly 25% over the past year amid optimism about Meta’s AI investments—enough to make Zuck the planet’s second-richest person for the first time. Musk reclaimed the title of world’s richest person from LVMH’s Bernard Arnault last May, when private investors valued Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, at $24 billion. Then, in December, he became the first person ever worth $400 billion, after xAI’s valuation doubled to $50 billion and Musk’s rocket maker, SpaceX, hit $350 billion (up from $210 billion in June). Shares of his EV company, Tesla, also reached an all-time high that month, but the stock has crashed by nearly 40% since inauguration day, when Musk took over as head of President Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Still, he’s worth $147 billion more than a year ago. And that’s before Musk announced last Friday that xAI had acquired his social media company X (formerly Twitter) in a deal that valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, or roughly what Musk paid for the platform in 2022.

March 31, 2025 19:28 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: YouTube’s Revenue Will Top Disney’s This Year As It Becomes “The Home For All Things Video”, Analyst Says

By Dade Hayes Business Editor YouTube‘s revenue will surpass Disney‘s this year, making it the top global player in media, according to a report by veteran Wall Street analyst Michael Nathanson. With $54.2 billion in revenue last year, the company is on pace to become No. 1 by the end of 2025, he predicts in a new report issued Monday. Because of its massive viewing, which has twice eclipsed that for Disney and other media giants according to Nielsen, the valuation for the former black sheep has continued moving skyward. “If YouTube was a standalone business, public comps suggest the business would be worth $475 to $550 billion, or about 30% of Alphabet’s current valuation,” wrote Nathanson, a partner in MoffettNathanson, in his annual report on YouTube, which anoints the company “king of all media.” (The value of Netflix and Meta Platforms, for comparison, are in a similar neighborhood.) Related Stories News 'Zootopia 2' Charms CinemaCon As Ke Huy Quan Intros Scenes Of Judy Hopps & Nick Wilde In Therapy With Quinta Brunson's Dr. Fuzzby News Zoe Saldaña Shows Off 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' At Disney's CinemaCon Despite his rhapsody about YouTube’s scale, growth and potential, Nathanson in the report actually lowered his 12-month price target on parent Alphabet’s shares by $10, putting it at $210. He reiterated the firm’s “buy” rating on the stock, however. Watch on Deadline Nathanson believes YouTube is just coming into its own as a seller of advertising in the living room. While the company has long touted growth of viewing of its content via a TV screen, confirming last month that it now has surpassed mobile, the ad marketplace is still catching up. Entrenched streaming ad purveyor Pluto is able to charge about 26 cents per hour of viewing, while YouTube is at about 18 cents, Nathanson estimates. “Given YouTube’s scaled reach and data advantage over other AVOD/FAST platforms, we believe YouTube is under-monetizing its engagement today and instead should be in a league of its own ahead of this comp group,” ahead of Tubi, Roku Channel and Pluto, the analyst writes. In addition to ad revenue upside, Nathanson continues, “YouTube is also positioned to become the home for all things video.” That projection is based on the company’s dominance across “three key buckets.” The report defines them as YouTube Premium & Music; YouTube TV, where the company recently surpassed 8 million subscribers, and “Other.” That last bucket includes YouTube Primetime Channels (including NFL Sunday Ticket), channel memberships, VOD, and creator monetization tools throwing off a share of proceeds to YouTube.

In our Thursday article, we talked about a “quiet shift” in the markets, from growth stocks to value—and we named 2 CEFs yielding 9%+ that are primed to profit from it. Yes, the recent jump in volatility is a big reason for that. So today, we’re going to look at another side of the rotation we’re seeing—a shift from passive investing to active. As we move further into 2025, it’s getting clearer to me that we’re into a stock-picker’s market. Sitting in an index fund just won’t cut it. That said, at my CEF Insider service, we’re still bullish on stocks (and stock-focused closed-end funds, many of which hand us 8%+ yields), and we’ll get into two stock-focused funds, along with another that holds preferred stocks—kind of a stock/bond hybrid—below. Because there’s no question that success in this market will require active management—moving into, and out of, the right stocks and sectors at the right times. Of course, many mainstream investors aren’t interested in that—it’s too much work. Which is why I’m betting that many of them are likely to give CEFs a closer look as we move further into 2025. As they do, they’ll discover what we’ve known at CEF Insider for years: CEFs let you sit back and collect high yields (and price upside) while “farming out” picking the actual investments to a professional human manager. That makes now a great time to pick up some well-run CEFs as active management (finally) regains appeal. Doing so lets us buy our CEFs at a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios), especially in the wake of the recent selloff. Then, as more investors pile in, we get to ride along as those discounts shrink, pulling our CEFs’ market prices higher as they do. Which brings me back to those three CEFs I mentioned off the top—the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG)—a CEF Insider holding—the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW) and the Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred and Income Securities Fund (FFC). All are trading at discounts and boast dividends that are either sky-high (9.4% in the case of ASG) or set to grow (like STEW’s 4%-yielding payout). ASG is a multi-manager fund that invests in large-, mid- and small-cap growth stocks. This means it leverages the knowledge of experts in different sectors (tech, financial, etc.), as well as experts with experience investing in big companies, small companies and everything in between. ASG is interesting now because, in a sense, it gives us two discounts. The first is the fund’s discount to NAV, which is 7.9% as I write this, even though the fund has delivered an 8.4% annualized total return over the last decade, based on its market price, as of this writing. That 7.9% discount is well below its five-year average of 1%, which is our first discount here. The other one is on the fund’s stocks themselves, and we can see the recent dip in those by looking at its NAV performance, including dividends. That’s entirely the result of the last few weeks of volatility: ASG Total Returns Meantime, ASG offers a rich 9.4% dividend yield. Unlike ETFs, which typically provide minimal yield, ASG’s managed-distribution policy (meaning ASG management can raise or lower payouts depending on what’s best for the fund’s long-term returns. Moreover, ASG’s overall yield is actually higher than it looks, since management regularly pays special dividends. ASG Dividend With a discount to NAV and a dip in its portfolio performance, ASG is set up to gain as more investors “farm out” their stock picking. Buy it now and we could collect that 9.4% “base” payout in the meantime. Next up is the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW), which sports one of the biggest discounts in CEFs, at 23.1%. That’s wild when you consider that STEW delivered a tidy 12.7% annualized return over the last decade. Moreover, that 23.1% discount is nearly five percentage points wider than STEW’s long-term average of 18.2%. STEW Discount STEW’s top holdings include Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), which comprises nearly 40% of the portfolio between the two share classes, as well as other well-known large caps, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and pipeline master limited partnership (MLP) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD). So, why is this fund trading at such a deep discount? Simply put: neglect. STEW doesn’t have the same name recognition as some larger CEFs. But with markets now rewarding active strategies and investors looking to large caps during this volatility, that’s set to change. STEW is also valuable because management can put 40% of their portfolio in stocks like BRK when they’re undervalued, while SEC rules limit passive funds to stick to no more than about 10% of their assets in any one holding. Once investors pick up on STEW’s strong performance and deep discount, the gap should narrow. And with a very well-covered dividend, you’re very likely to see higher payouts over time, building on the 4% yield you’d get on a buy made today. In fact, history strongly suggests that’s exactly what’ll happen here: STEW Dividend Just in the past five years, STEW’s payout has jumped 62%, and as you can see at the right of this chart, its payout growth is accelerating. That bodes well for anyone buying this bargain-priced CEF today. The Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Securities Income Fund (FFC) holds preferred shares, which trade on an exchange, like stocks, and represent ownership in a company. But their price movements are more like those of bonds. And, like bonds, they’re sensitive to interest rates. More on that in a second. Banks and insurance companies are the main issuers of preferreds, which is why 54% of FFC’s portfolio consists of financial services firms, with preferreds from the likes of Wells Fargo and MetLife. That’s something to keep in mind when you’re considering how FFC fits into your overall portfolio weighting. Beyond that, the fund is a good way to pick up a basket of preferreds and lock in a 6.8% yield while doing so. FFC Dividend Above you can see the rate sensitivity of FFC’s dividend in action, with the payout moving lower as rates rose in 2022 and 2023, then steadying and rising as rates topped out and began to move lower (along with a special dividend late last year). Here’s what makes FFC particularly interesting now: It historically trades at a premium to NAV of 1%, but it’s currently at a 5.8% discount. That’s a big break from its norm, and it’s unlikely to last. Preferred securities tend to do well when rates are stabilizing, and that’s where we are now, with Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell saying he’s content to hold off on further cuts until the effects of Trump administration policies (especially around tariffs) become clearer. Even so, the latest projections from the Federal Open Market Committee do still indicate that two rate cuts are expected in 2025, probably toward the end of the year. When that happens, preferreds will benefit, and funds like FFC are likely to see renewed interest—which I see pushing the fund’s discount back toward a premium. That leaves us with FFC’s 6.8% dividend (with potential for more payout growth) to collect while we wait. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Stocks close out their worst quarter since 2022 amid tariff uncertainty

BREAKING: China to impose a 34% tariff on all U.S. imports, escalating trade war as officials urge Trump to reverse course Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Two of the three major U.S. stock indexes just wrapped up their worst quarter in well over two years. The third barely avoided the same fate. The S&P 500 dropped more than 4.5% for the first quarter of 2025 as of Monday’s close, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 10.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 1.3% lower and recorded its first back-to-back monthly loss since October 2023. The declines on all three indexes come days before President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new slate of wide-ranging tariffs, extending ongoing trade policy turmoil that has kept investors guessing for months. The broad-based S&P 500 fell briefly into correction territory Monday, meaning a 10% slide from its last high. The index regained some ground late in the day, but not enough to dodge its worst monthly percentage drop since December 2022. The index’s first-quarter stumbles ended a streak of five straight winning quarters, while the Nasdaq wiped out more than half of last year’s gains over the last three months. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta, known on Wall Street as the “magnificent 7,” have lost more than $2 trillion in market value collectively since the start of the year. The last time U.S. markets stumbled as badly was in the middle of 2022 after Russia’s late-February invasion of Ukraine, shocking the global economy as Western nations hit Moscow with severe sanctions and commodities like oil and grains shot up in price. The first quarter of this year saw geopolitical upheaval of a different sort, as investors have struggled to digest the series of major U.S. policy changes since Inauguration Day. The quarter marked the S&P’s worst performance versus the rest of the world since 1980, according to Dow Jones — at a time when a number of foreign stock markets have surged. The Euro Stoxx 600 index, which tracks companies across 17 countries, has risen 5% to start the year as the S&P 500 dropped by roughly the same amount. In fact, the Stoxx 600 has just had its best quarter against the S&P since 2015, according to FactSet data. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 also rose more than 5% in the same period. The MSCI China index, a benchmark of 580 Chinese stocks, ended the first quarter up 16%. Markets overseas have popped for a range of reasons, with some but not all related to the Trump administration’s actions. The European Union and U.K. have taken steps to trim regulations and hike military spending in response to White House moves, boosting shares of defense companies in both places and helping power markets there overall. In China, the strong performance has been more a reflection of local factors, including economic stimulus and enthusiasm around home-grown AI startups. It’s not a rosy picture everywhere, though. Japan’s flagship stock index sank 10% in the first quarter over fears about slowing manufacturing and an export economy that could be hurt by Trump’s still-expanding tariff agenda. The president is set to open another front in his trade war Wednesday, a date he has dubbed America’s “Liberation Day” from the purported abuses of its top trading partners, many of them longtime allies. Trump has vowed so-called reciprocal tariffs aimed at equalizing trade barriers between the U.S. and a number of countries that sell to Americans more of their own goods and services than those they buy from the U.S. But with the details of this policy program still up in the air days before it’s set to roll out, business leaders and consumers have been grappling with widespread uncertainty over the coming impact. Nearly 900 nonfinancial companies mentioned tariffs on recent earnings calls, S&P Global Market Intelligence said this month. “This is truly ridiculous,” one manufacturing executive said in an anonymous Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey published Monday. “I have been in business for 50 years as of next year, and never have I seen such uncertainty in the market. It is very difficult to plan and make decisions.” But things could still turn around in the months ahead, some analysts say. “Once tariffs are announced on April 2, negotiations to soften them can begin,” researchers at the investment bank UBS said in a note to clients Monday. “Progress toward a budget reconciliation bill could refocus attention on market-positive aspects of the Trump agenda.” Steve Kopack is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Does CoreWeave's disappointing IPO signal an AI bubble?

Time Published: 2025-03-31T19:29:00Z

New Jersey-based AI and cloud computing company CoreWeave made its market debut on Friday to little applause. The stock was poised for success by all means: It was the biggest tech IPO since software company UiPath (PATH-5.41%) in 2021, and a rare IPO of a pure-play AI company. Plus, it was backed by market-favorite tech giant Nvidia (NVDA-7.00%), which ended up having to anchor the IPO last minute with a $250 million order. But things didn’t pan out as expected. The company had initially targeted a $2.7 billion raise but ended up coming in at $1.5 billion instead. The shares priced at $40, well below the $47 to $50 price range expected previously, and started trading on Friday at $39. On Monday, the stock’s second day of trading, the shares were down almost 10% in midday trading. CoreWeave is a cloud computing company that provides GPU infrastructure to major tech names like Microsoft (MSFT-1.77%) and Meta (META-8.71%). The company primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs to run these data centers. Due to the costly nature of the business, CoreWeave relies on accumulating debt to build its capacity, relying on future demand for AI computing power. CoreWeave is considered a pure-play AI company because the company’s success bets directly on the future of AI demand growth. Most pure-play AI companies — like OpenAI, which kicked off the AI craze in 2022 with ChatGPT — are privately held and don’t publicly disclose finances, which makes it tough for investors to have a gauge on the industry as a whole. CoreWeave’s market debut was seen by many as a way to understand how the AI trade was going amidst rising fears of an AI bubble. Some industry experts think the stock’s disappointing IPO should be an indicator that the hype is subsiding. “[If] a year ago CoreWeave had gone public, the words ‘AI’ and ‘Nvidia’ would have been enough to carry it over the line. The fact that it’s not able to do it now is an indicator that the momentum of just trading based on the words AI or Nvidia are not working anymore,” NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance Aswath Damodaran told CNBC last week, adding that he thinks that’s healthy and that AI has been hyped a bit too much. “The AI product and service business, which ultimately is what has to pay for all of this, has not taken off in any substantial way. I mean, I’m hard pressed to think about any company making significant money from the AI product and service business,” Damodaran said. For its part, OpenAI expects revenue to more than triple by the end of this year, according to revenue expectations reported by Bloomberg last week, but the company doesn’t anticipate to be cash-flow positive until 2029. Market skepticism of the AI trade began late last year, Damodaran said, and accelerated when Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets by unveiling a reasoning model that rivaled OpenAI’s for less cost and energy earlier this year. What happened last week with the CoreWeave IPO, Damodaran says, is the market recognizing that “too much money” has been spent “too far in advance of the actual evidence that the market exists.” “I think we’re at that moment in the AI business where we’re looking for some evidence that AI product and service business will be trillions of dollars rather than hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said. Not all experts agree that the IPO’s disappointment has a direct correlation with the power of the AI trade, though. “While the CoreWeave IPO clearly did not go well, it should not be taken as an indication of the strength of the market for AI,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Quartz. Luria thinks that CoreWeave is “a little more than a highly leveraged off balance sheet arrangement for Nvidia,” pointing to Nvidia’s decision to bail out the company’s IPO. CoreWeave’s leveraged spending helps fuel Nvidia’s GPU sales without putting any direct financial risk on Nvidia. In an initiation note last week, Luria said CoreWeave’s debt-based business model can only be sustainable as long as demand for AI grows “faster than hyperscalers are able to build data centers,” making CoreWeave a risky investment as is. Regarding speculations of whether or not AI is in a bubble, Luria makes an analogy to the 2008 financial crisis, in which collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) — particularly, subprime mortgages — played a huge role in creating a housing bubble. “If AI was a CDO, we see CoreWeave as the sub-prime tranche,” Luria wrote. D.A. Davidson currently has a neutral rating on the stock. “The importance of AI to the future path of technology transcends any one company, and is definitely bigger than CoreWeave,” Luria told Quartz.

What happened last week with the CoreWeave IPO, Damodaran says, is the market recognizing that “too much money” has been spent “too far in advance of the actual evidence that the market exists.” “I think we’re at that moment in the AI business where we’re looking for some evidence that AI product and service business will be trillions of dollars rather than hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said. Not all experts agree that the IPO’s disappointment has a direct correlation with the power of the AI trade, though. “While the CoreWeave IPO clearly did not go well, it should not be taken as an indication of the strength of the market for AI,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Quartz. Luria thinks that CoreWeave is “a little more than a highly leveraged off balance sheet arrangement for Nvidia,” pointing to Nvidia’s decision to bail out the company’s IPO. CoreWeave’s leveraged spending helps fuel Nvidia’s GPU sales without putting any direct financial risk on Nvidia. In an initiation note last week, Luria said CoreWeave’s debt-based business model can only be sustainable as long as demand for AI grows “faster than hyperscalers are able to build data centers,” making CoreWeave a risky investment as is. Regarding speculations of whether or not AI is in a bubble, Luria makes an analogy to the 2008 financial crisis, in which collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) — particularly, subprime mortgages — played a huge role in creating a housing bubble. “If AI was a CDO, we see CoreWeave as the sub-prime tranche,” Luria wrote. D.A. Davidson currently has a neutral rating on the stock. “The importance of AI to the future path of technology transcends any one company, and is definitely bigger than CoreWeave,” Luria told Quartz.

Title: Dividend Investing For Beginners In 4 Simple Steps

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Dividend investing can be fun and financially rewarding. Dividend investing does not have to be intimidating or complicated. It only takes some quick learning and a few easy steps to start building your passive dividend income stream. Dividend investing can be fun and financially rewarding. The fun happens when dividend payments hit your account every quarter or month. The financial rewards—which are ongoing—include two forms of returns, rising income and low volatility. Dividend-paying securities provide cash income plus appreciation potential. Together, earned dividends and price gains comprise your total return. Total return is an important metric for comparing dividend-payers to securities that don’t pay dividends. Dividend-paying securities often produce lower total returns than growth stocks. This makes sense because their risk is lower. With a dividend payer, the income is yours once it lands in your account. It cannot be rescinded, and you can use the cash to reinvest. Many growth securities do not pay dividends. They only provide appreciation gains which you earn when their price rises. Those gains are not permanent and can change quickly if the stock price falls. Some dividend securities provide ongoing income that rises over time. Rising income is a valuable offset to inflation, particularly in retirement—when you don’t have the opportunity to get a raise at work. Dividend stocks are categorized by how many consecutive years they have raised their shareholder payouts: These companies can cancel or reduce their dividend at any point, so their current status does not guarantee future income. Therefore, diversification is important. When your income portfolio is diversified, you are less dependent on one company’s dividend policy. Not every company can pay dividends consistently for decades. This achievement requires: These same qualities encourage low stock-price volatility and relatively consistent earnings. This is why some of the best dividend-paying stocks are blue-chip companies. Blue-chip describes large, financially strong companies with recognizable brand names such as Chevron (CVX), IBM (IBM) and Walmart (WMT). Even if you’ve never invested before, you can start dividend investing in four simple steps. You’ll choose an account, pick your asset type, invest and automate. Earned dividends are taxable, even if you reinvest them. Many domestic stocks pay qualified dividends, which are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate. Nonqualified dividends are taxed at the higher ordinary income tax rate. You can defer the annual federal tax obligation by holding your dividend payers in a tax-advantaged account. 401(k)s, IRAs, HSAs and 529 plans provide tax deferrals on investment earnings. Tax-advantaged accounts have withdrawal restrictions, which can be good or bad depending on your goals. If you are investing to build retirement income, then it makes sense to hold dividend securities in an IRA or 401(k). If you prefer to access the income sooner than retirement, a regular brokerage account or direct investment with the company will do. In this case, remember to plan for a higher tax bill each year. Next, you will pick which types of security you prefer. This may be an easy choice if you invest in a 401(k) with limited investment options. In accounts with broad access to publicly traded securities, you can choose from individual stocks, REITs and funds. Stocks Stocks are ownership shares of publicly traded companies. The dividend payments represent your share of profits. REITs REIT stands for real estate investment trust. These entities own and manage real estate. Special tax treatment requires REITs to pay 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. Funds Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) are investment portfolios that sell shares. As a fund shareholder, you earn when the portfolio produces income or increases in value. Many funds focus on dividend-paying securities to provide income for their shareholders. Examples include Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) and Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV). There are also REIT funds, such as iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (USRT) and SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR). Next, you will research your options and place your first trade order. You can prepare for this step by deciding whether to prioritize dividend yield or income consistency. Dividend yield measures income efficiency. It is calculated as the annual dividend payment divided by the share price. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a blue-chip index, pays an average dividend yield of 1.82%. Some stocks and REITs pay much higher yields, but the payments may vary over time. If you are not yet comfortable analyzing a stock or REIT's yield, dividend track record and financial health, opt for a fund with a low expense ratio and 100 or more securities in its portfolio. Consistent, recurring investments help you grow your dividend portfolio and income potential faster. Consider setting a monthly investing budget and automating those trades in your investment account. You can also reinvest your dividend payments automatically. This allows you to raise your income potential through compounding, which happens when your investment earnings generate more earnings. Many brokerage accounts allow for automatic dividend reinvestment. If yours doesn't, look for stocks or funds that offer direct investment and free dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP). Direct stock purchase plans are managed through the company rather than a broker. They may have lower fees than brokerage accounts, but the shares can be harder to sell. Computershare is a good resource for researching DRIPs. With the right investments, your dividend program can be low-maintenance and self-propelling. Opt for stocks or REITs with long and consistent dividend track records and low-fee funds emphasizing dividend reliability. Invest often, reinvest your dividends and watch your income potential grow over time.

Title: Nvidia To Invest Billions In U.S. Supply Chain As Tech Companies Commit To Trump's Onshoring Pledge

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Leading artificial intelligence chip maker Nvidia NVDA plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. supply chain over the next four years. CEO Jensen Huang told the Financial Times that the increased U.S. production was being made possible thanks to suppliers such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM and Foxconn FXCOF. “Overall, we will procure, over the course of the next four years, probably half a trillion dollars worth of electronics in total,” Huang told the FT. “And I think we can easily see ourselves manufacturing several hundred billion of it here in the U.S.” Don't Miss: Huang, speaking on March 18 during his company’s GTC convention, believed the Trump administration’s “America First” policy would enable his company to ramp up chip production in the U.S. “Having the support of an administration who cares about the success of this industry and not allowing energy to be an obstacle is a phenomenal result for AI in the U.S.,” he told the FT. Huang’s sentiments follow pledges by other tech companies to onshore manufacturing in the U.S. rather than overseas. Apple has committed to spending $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, expanding teams and facilities in Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. Trending: Invest in the Future of Digital Engagement. Own a Piece of the $100 Billion Metaverse Today for Just $500. TSMC has already committed a $100 billion investment in a chip fabrication plant in Arizona, which President Donald Trump has said would create thousands of jobs bringing Taiwan Semiconductor’s investment to "about $165 billion." “TSMC investing in the U.S. provides for a substantial step up in our supply chain resilience,” Huang told the FT. TSMC’s Taiwan-based production facilities have been an increasingly pivotal part of Nvidia and Apple’s manufacturing process, which Trump was once keen to change, previously threatening to impose tariffs on Taiwan. By pledging to build new facilities in the U.S., Trump said that Taiwan avoided a 25% tariff. “TSMC already has plants in the US and Japan, and it’s now building a new plant in Germany,” Taiwanese presidential office spokesperson Karen Kuo told the Guardian. “These have nothing to do with tariffs. TSMC’s global expansion is a crucial development.” See Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now. Trump has been basking in a wave of tech commitments to manufacture products in the U.S. “GE Aerospace GE announced on Tuesday a nearly $1 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, the latest company to do so under the Trump administration… It marks the latest company to put money back into the U.S. economy,” Trump said. Other tech companies or those that finance them have also announced big U.S.-based investments. Meta META has announced a $65 billion investment, most of which will be used to construct new data centers to fuel its AI operations. This follows investments from Google, Microsoft MSFT, and Amazon AMZN in data centers as the AI arms race heats up. Trump has announced a joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle ORCL called Stargate, which aims to invest at least $100 billion in U.S. data centers. Many of these data centers will house the incredibly powerful GPU computers powering the AI revolution. Nvidia currently has between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market used in GPUs.

Title: Rivian’s Micromobility Incubator ‘Also’ Gets Surprise Debut

ByWilliam Roberson ByWilliam Roberson Contributor. LAGUNA BEACH, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 07: Founder and CEO of Rivian RJ Scaringe speaks onstage during the ... More Rivian Reveals All-Electric R2 Midsize SUV event at Rivian South Coast Theater on March 07, 2024 in Laguna Beach, California. (Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Rivian) Recently, when Rivian electric car company founder Robert “RJ” Scaringe introduced the R2S SUV and R2T pickup truck, he paid homage to Apple founder Steve Jobs’ iconic “one more thing” end-of-presentation-surprise strategy. Scaringe introduced not one unexpected vehicle—the R3—but also a second variant, the R3X, which has the automotive segment excited even though the new models are still a year or so from production. Watch the wink to Jobs at the 27:45 mark: Now, Scaringe and Rivian have announced another unexpected thing: a micromobility development company called Also, Inc. The products from Also will skew more toward personal use, although some micromobility products—especially e-bikes—are quickly becoming staples of the delivery industry, with workers contracting with companies such as Uber Eats, Doordash and others. Rivian has also produced tens of thousands of distinctive electric delivery vans for Amazon.com and recently began offering the vans for public sale. “Also will focus on small, lightweight vehicles that are designed to meet the global mobility transportation challenges of today and tomorrow,” Rivian said in a press release, with Scaringe adding “for the world to fully transition to electrified transportation, a range of vehicle types and form factors will be needed.” Also will be its own company, but will work closely with Rivian, much like Harley-Davidson and its e-moto spinoff LiveWire and Royal Enfield with its new electric motorcycle company Flying Flea (below). Chris Yu, Rivian’s VP of future programs, will be president of Also, according to Rivian’s press release. Additional funding for Also totaling over $100 million will come from investment company Eclipse, which is currently working with dozens of small tech startups. Other partners, so far unnamed, are reportedly involved. No specific products or timelines have been announced as of yet, but Scaringe has a history of paying attention to the mobility market, even while developing his full-size vehicles. According to tech tracking site TechCrunch, Scaringe will show an initial vehicle later this year, and strongly hinted it will be an affordable e-bike. TechCrunch said Scaringe and Rivian growth director and Eclipse partner Jiten Behl started talking about developing micromobility products just ahead of the pandemic. During the Covid years, TechCrunch said Christ Yu from bicycle and e-bike maker Specialized joined the effort. Bloomberg posted in early 2023 that Rivian was working on an e-bike, but details were scant. Scaringe founded Rivian in 2009, one year after Tesla began production of its first model, the original Lotus-based Roadster. Rivian went public in late 2021 with a stock price near $130 per share, giving the company a massive market cap before they had produced many commercial vehicles. The first Rivian R1T electric pickup for commercial sale rolled off the assembly line in September of that year. The stock fell as the pandemic wore on and excitement over EVs waned. Rivian CEO Robert "RJ" Scaringe speaks at the unveiling of the Rivian R3X (R) and R3 electric ... More vehicles at the Rivian South Coast Theater in Laguna Beach, California, on March 7, 2024. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Today, Rivian shares remain in the teens and production continues for the company’s latest generation of R1S and R1T vehicles as well as the distinctive electric delivery vans. Rivian’s market cap has hovered around $10 to $20 billion since 2022, and the company turned its first official profit—$170 million—in the last quarter of 2024 after years of heavy losses as production scaled up. With many prospective EV buyers souring on Tesla vehicles due to CEO Elon Musk’s political involvement, Rivian’s profile has risen as of late. With President Trump’s fairly antagonistic relationship with (most) electric vehicles and a possible end of tax incentives of EV buyers, the move to release Also into the wild might be timely if the vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and not affected by tariffs. The vast majority of e-bikes, electric scooters and other micromobility products are manufactured in China, putting them at risk of price increases due to tariffs. Scaringe told TechCrunch he thinks many e-bikes are overpriced; a competitive domestic product with no tariff charges could have legs (or wheels) if production can scale quickly and import tariffs remain in place.

Title: Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are tackling heart health next

After revolutionizing the weight-loss drug market, Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.38%) and Eli Lilly (LLY-3.54%) are setting their sights on heart health. Both pharma giants unveiled new clinical trial results over the weekend, highlighting potential cardiovascular benefits of their medications. Novo Nordisk shared fresh data on semaglutide — the active ingredient in its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. One study found that a weekly 2.4 mg dose led to a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events — such as heart attack, stroke, or death — among overweight or obese patients with existing cardiovascular disease, compared with a control group. Another study examined its daily semaglutide pill, Rybelsus, which showed a 14% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and some combination of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, compared with a placebo. Novo Nordisk’s chief rival, Eli Lilly, also released new heart health data. It said its experimental drug lepodisiran lowered levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) — a particle linked to cardiovascular disease — by 94% with a single injection. About 20% of Americans have high levels of Lp(a), which can double the risk of a heart attack and is linked with conditions like stroke and aortic valve stenosis. However, it remains unclear whether lowering Lp(a) levels translates into fewer heart attacks and strokes and large-scale clinical trials are underway to answer that question. These latest findings build on previous efforts by both companies to explore their medications’ effects on heart health. “Novo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,” Martin Holst Lange, the company’s executive vice president for development, said in a press release. Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded Wegovy’s approved use after Novo Nordisk announced that the drug cut the risk of serious heart events by 20% in a clinical trial. Meanwhile, in August, Lilly said that tirzepatide — the active ingredient in its weight-loss drug Zepbound — helped reduce heart failure risks in obese patients. Patients who took tirzepatide were 38% less likely to be hospitalized, require increased heart failure medication, or die from heart failure compared than those who received a placebo. Novo Nordisk’s shares gained 0.9% in U.S. trading on Monday, while Eli Lilly’s stock declined about 1%. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

March 31, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, March 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 14, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022, to February 3, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR MERCK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 30, 2024, Merck released its second quarter 2024 financial report and disclosed a significant reduction in Gardasil vaccinations, resulting in an overabundance of inventory at Merck’s Chinese distributor. The Company announced that its shipments of Gardasil to China may fall below contracted levels for 2024. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $12.53, or 9.8%, to close at $115.25 per share on July 30, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 4, 2025, Merck disclosed that it would entirely cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory,” citing a continued over-inflation of channel inventories as demand in China had “not recovered to the level [the Company] had expected.” Merck also announced that it would no longer achieve its long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

CoreWeave's life as a publicly traded company is off to a rough start. The Nvidia-backed (NVDA) cloud-computing company managed to finish Friday, its first day of trading, in line with its IPO price and up from where it opened the session. On Monday morning, though, CoreWeave (CRWV) stock was pulled lower as markets slid. Shares of CoreWeave were recently down about 9% to under $37, below the $39 at which it opened trading last week. Part of the pullback is likely due to broader market concern, with investors jittery about what might happen later this week with the Trump administration tariff policy. That unease has lately weighed on tech shares, among them those associated with artificial intelligence, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the major indexes lower in recent trading today. The company in its IPO sold fewer shares, and at a lower price, than it originally hoped. One backer: the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), which on Friday said it had acquired more than 400,000 shares. “There’s a lot of headwinds in the macro. There are headwinds in the AI trade," CEO Mike Intrator said on CNBC Friday. "We definitely had to scale, or right-size, the transaction for where the buy interest was.”

Title: Tesla's first-quarter deliveries are likely to miss the mark, according to analysts

Tesla (TSLA-5.86%) investors should brace themselves for first-quarter sales that fail to impress, analysts say, as the backlash over Elon Musk’s politics and his role in mass layoffs take a toll on the company. Analysts on average expect Tesla on Wednesday to report deliveries of 408,000 electric vehicles for the January to March quarter, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-2.77%). Several analysts have downgraded their expectations to below 400,000 in recent weeks, as domestic protests against Tesla have raged and international sales slumped. Deutsche Bank (DB-6.00%) analysts last week reduced its first-quarter forecast by about 50,000 units to 345,000 deliveries, which would translate to an 11% year-over-year drop and a 30% decrease from the previous quarter. Deutsche also lowered its full-year estimate to 1.7 million units sold from 2.1 million units, a 5% decline compared to 2024. Tesla has forecasted a “return to growth” in 2025 after narrowly missing its 2024 sales goal and recording its first annual sales decline. In October, Musk forecasted sales growth of 30% for 2025. “The main drivers of the downside are weakness in Europe and the Model Y Juniper changeover,” analysts led by Edison Yu said, referring to Tesla’s updated electric SUV. Tesla’s sales in the European Union fell 49% in January and February compared to a year earlier, according to the European Automobile Manufacturer’s Association, with just 19,000 units registered. JATO Dynamics found that registrations of Tesla’s best-selling Model Y and Model 3 fell by 65% and 14%, respectively, in February. In China, where domestic automakers including BYD (BYDDY-2.11%) and Xiaomi (XIACF+3.30%) are growing their share of the market and electrified-vehicle sales are soaring, Tesla’s sales fell 49% year-over-year in February. The firm sold 30,688 vehicles, its lowest monthly figure since July 2022. Tesla has struggled to launch its advanced driver assistance technology in China, even as BYD plans to attach its “God’s Eye” software to just about all vehicles it sells. Some Chinese automakers are also able to sell their cars for dirt cheap. In the U.S., RBC Capital Markets (RY+0.34%) thinks Tesla will report 152,000 vehicles sold, according to a March 27 note. Analysts expect to see sales slammed by the recent string of protests against Tesla, which organizers view as an extension of Musk and his influence. Thousands have joined the “Takedown Tesla” demonstrations organized to protest Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, while critical owners of Tesla stock — and other investors fearing a crash — have been selling their shares. Acts of vandalism against Tesla facilities and vehicles have become more frequent, even pushing Tesla out of a major Canadian auto show whose organizers were worried about backlash. Forty-seven percent of voters surveyed by NBC News (CMCSA-2.23%) earlier this month had a negative view of DOGE, while 51% had a negative view of Musk himself. DOGE, however, was more popular, with 46% calling it a good idea and 40% saying it was bad. Telsa shares hit a record price of $479.86 at its post-election fueled peak on Dec. 17, but most of those gains have since been wiped out. The stock has fallen by more than 34% year-to-date, sending Musk’s net worth down $102 billion to $330 billion. Shares are down almost 6% in intraday trading on Monday. “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” JPMorgan (JPM-6.91%) analysts recently wrote of DOGE’s impact on Tesla. But it’s still unclear how much that brand damage — which began with Musk’s support of Trump during the 2024 election — will impact sales. Deutsche analysts, for example, noted that they believe “there is some level of brand damage” happening in Western Europe and “pockets” of the U.S. and Canada, but quantifying it is trickier to tell. Musk’s years-long shift toward the right wing had already irritated some potential customers with opposing views. In EV-friendly California, traditionally Tesla’s biggest domestic market, sales have dropped for five straight quarters. Just 13% of Democrats would consider buying a Tesla, according to a February Morning Consult poll. Conservatives, meanwhile, have embraced Musk; Trump has bought himself a Model S and his administration has promised to treat people vandalizing Tesla facilities as domestic terrorists. It’s still unclear how their support will translate into sales. Tesla will report its sales on Wednesday just hours before Trump’s planned 25% tariffs on vehicle imports will go into effect. The tariff will be extended to impact imported auto parts no later than May 3. That will affect just about every major automaker selling cars in the U.S., including Tesla, and may negatively impact sales. Musk has said the cost impact of the tariffs will not be “trivial” and that Tesla won’t be left unscathed. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on a January earnings call that the tariffs will hit the company’s business and profitability. In a recent letter to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Tesla said that even with “aggressive” localization of the supply chain, some parts are “difficult or impossible” to source domestically. Between 60% and 75% of the parts used in Tesla’s electric vehicles are made in the U.S., although that varies by model. “[I]t is becoming crystal clear this tariff/U.S. policy will cause pure chaos to the global auto industry and will raise the prices of a typical car to a US consumer by $5k to $10k out of the gates,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a Monday note. “The winner in our view from this tariff is no one....as even Tesla still is clearly hit from these tariffs and will be forced to raise prices,” Ives, a major Tesla bull, added.

The market’s highest-performing tech stocks, the Magnificent 7, mostly slid on Monday amid worries over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Tesla (TSLA-5.86%) was down 4.8% at 11:30 a.m., while Nvidia (NVDA-7.00%) was off 4.1%, Amazon (AMZN-9.05%) was 3% lower, Meta (META-8.71%) fell 2.1% Microsoft (MSFT-1.77%) dropped 2.5%, and Alphabet (GOOGL-3.68%) was down by 1.1%. Apple (AAPL-9.76%) stock was the outlier among the Mag 7, rising 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 indexes fell 1.5% and 0.5%, respectively, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed earlier losses to rise about 88 points, or 0.2%. The Trump administration is expected to announce new tariffs on Wednesday that could include his so-called reciprocal tariff plan. The White House is currently debating over implementing individualized tariffs on trading partners, or an across-the-board tariff impacting all U.S. trade, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA-3.16%) reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. The president reportedly wants more aggression on tariffs, and has asked his team for plans to impose higher rates of tariffs on more countries, according to the Wall Street Journal. One plan reportedly involves tariffs of up to 20% on mostly all of the country’s trading partners. Trump has also reportedly pushed for import taxes on goods from countries that the U.S. has a trade deficit with. The Trump administration may also introduce industry-specific tariffs, including those that would impact critical minerals and related products, on Wednesday, but that’s not yet certain. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS-9.14%) economists bumped their forecast of the odds of a recession over the next 12 months to 35% from 20%. The increase “reflects our lower growth baseline, the sharp recent deterioration in household and business confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of their policies,” the economists wrote in a note.

Title: Bitcoin nears overbought zone – Why the risk of more losses remains high

Bitcoin faces uncertain market conditions, approaching oversold levels and volatility, with potential opportunities for long-term investors. The “Liberation Day” that U.S. President Donald Trump has discussed is approaching. Heading into the week, U.S. tech stocks saw losses in the overnight trading, with Tesla [TSLA] and Nvidia [NVDA] posting 5% and 3% losses, respectively. The Kobeissi Letter noted that the economic policy uncertainty reached the highest it has since 2020, with the 2nd of April being the date to watch. Moreover, the U.S. jobs report will arrive on the 4th of April, which could also influence market sentiment outside of the tariff news. Gold ETFs saw massive capital inflows, likely a direct consequence of the growing economic uncertainty. This has also put Bitcoin [BTC] and the rest of the crypto sphere on the back foot, as they are risk-on assets. AMBCrypto delved into on-chain metrics to understand if BTC can stabilize around the March lows at $78k or if investors should expect more losses. Source: Checkonchain The short-term holder MVRV Bollinger Bands chart showed that the oscillator was in oversold conditions in late February and early March. Also, the price of Bitcoin was below the cost-basis of short-term holders. This is calculated using the realized price of coins moved within the last 155 days. The price of BTC had been “heated up” in November and December but has cooled off significantly since then. Bitcoin was likely to move below the oversold level, which stood at $78.95k at press time. Source: Checkonchain The Mayer multiple serves as a key metric for determining whether Bitcoin is fairly priced, overvalued, or undervalued based on historical trends. Analysts calculate it by dividing Bitcoin’s market price by its 200-day Moving Average (MA). At press time, the Mayer multiple stood at 0.96. Two weeks ago, BTC fell below its 200DMA and has traded just below this level for most of this time. It stood at $85.92k at press time. The last time the price fell below the 200 DMA was August 2024. The price stayed below this MA for almost two months back then. A similar scenario could unfold now. Investors looking to buy BTC cheap should keep an eye on the 0.8 Mayer multiple, which represented the $68.74k level. Bitcoin would be considered “cheap” around this price level. In conclusion, long-term investors need to hunker down and weather the economic storm of the coming weeks and months. Once the sentiment across the market begins to shift, the trend might shift bullishly. Until then, they can Dollar Cost Average (DCA) into BTC or wait for nasty price drops from giant liquidation events to grab more BTC.

Title: Elon Musk says his DOGE gig has cost him and Tesla 'a lot'

Elon Musk acknowledged that his role overseeing President Donald Trump’s efforts to slash federal spending is costing him — and Tesla (TSLA-5.86%) — “a lot.” Backlash over Musk’s job leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was swift and has grown in recent weeks as the group continues to direct the Trump administration’s approach to downsizing the government. Musk claimed last week that DOGE cuts an average of $4 billion in federal spending each day. His Tesla has become an easy target for protesters angered by his support of Trump and his work in the federal government. Non-violent, anti-Tesla protests have been held across the U.S. and other countries, while vandalism against the company’s customers and facilities has ramped up. Forty-seven percent of voters surveyed by NBC News (CMCSA-2.23%) earlier this month had a negative view of DOGE, while 51% had a negative view of Musk himself. The idea of DOGE, however, was more popular, with 46% calling it a good idea and 40% saying it was bad. “What they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to you know, I don’t know, stop doing this,” Musk said on Sunday. “My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it’s a big deal.” Telsa shares hit a record price of $479.86 at its post-election fueled peak on Dec. 17, but most of those gains have since been wiped out. The stock has fallen by more than 30% year-to-date, sending Musk’s net worth down $102 billion to $330 billion. He still has a more than $100 billion lead over the next richest person in the world, Amazon (AMZN-9.05%) founder Jeff Bezos. Tesla stock dropped by more than 5% to $248 per share in pre-market trading on Monday as investors await weaker first-quarter sales than previously expected. Deliveries are expected to have taken a hit from the “Tesla Takedown” protests that have continued to put pressure on Tesla, as well as weaker sales in Europe and China. “Long term I think Tesla stock’s going to do fine, so maybe it’s a buying opportunity,” Musk said from a political event in Wisconsin, where he took the stage wearing a cheesehead hat. The Tesla CEO was in Wisconsin on Sunday to support Brad Schimel, who has been endorsed by Republicans in the state’s Supreme Court election scheduled for Tuesday. Musk and his allies have spent more than $20 million campaigning across the state. On Sunday, Musk handed out $1 million checks to two local voters who had expressed support for Schimel and signed a petition supporting his candidacy. A third individual had earlier received a $1 million check. Those people were also named as spokespeople for his America PAC, a tactic that allows the group to side-step accusations of running an illegal lottery. A similar strategy was employed by Musk to hand out $1 million checks to more than a dozen people during the 2024 presidential election. “Easiest money you ever made!” Musk said on Monday, advocating for people to get Wisconsin residents to sign America PAC’s petition and post a photo supporting Schimel. “Every time you do that you get $20 and they get $20. The goal is to build awareness about the election tomorrow, so this offer applies to today and tomorrow.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Stocks fell on Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported that President Donald Trump has pushed his team to be more aggressive on tariffs in recent days. The S&P 500 fell 1.3%, the Nasdaq Composite 2.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.6% as of 9:54 a.m. EDT. Shares of the Magnificent 7 mostly extended their declines. The losses were 6.4% for Tesla (TSLA-5.86%), 5% for Nvidia (NVDA-7.00%), 4% for Amazon (AMZN-9.05%), 3.4% for Meta (META-8.71%), 2.7% for Microsoft (MSFT-1.77%), and 2.2% for Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL-3.68%). Apple (AAPL-9.76%) was little changed. Automakers were mixed, with Stellantis (STLA-9.41%) dropping 1.9%, General Motors (GM-4.02%) off just 0.2% and Ford (F-5.37%) gaining 0.6%. Advisers have considered instituting tariffs of up to 20% on almost all U.S. trading partners, the Journal said, adding that Trump has pushed to levy import taxes on goods from all countries with which the U.S. has a trade deficit. The possibility of so-called “reciprocal” tariffs remains on the table, it added. He’s due to make a major announcement on tariffs on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs (GS-9.14%) economists increased their forecast odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 20% to 35%. The Chicago Business Barometer PMI for March unexpectedly increased to 47.6 from 45.5 in February. The consensus estimate had been for 44.1. A reading under 50 indicates contraction. Here are some stocks to watch today. The Bank of China’s (BACHY-1.01%) ADRs jumped 7.8% after the lender disclosed a planned sale of new shares to Chinese government entities to boost Tier 1 equity capital. China Construction Bank (CICHY-0.06%), the Bank of Communications (BCMXY0.00%), and the Postal Savings Bank of China also disclosed similar stock sales. Coinbase (COIN-6.99%) slid 4% as Bitcoin declined, the WSJ reported. Other crypto-sensitive shares fell, including Robinhood (HOOD-10.88%), by 5.1%, and MicroStrategy (MSTR-9.59%), by 4.6%. Moderna (MRNA-6.46%) stock plunged 12% after the Food and Drug Administration’s top vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, resigned and told the acting commissioner that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is seeking subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,” according to the Associated Press. U.S. Bancorp (USB-9.43%) Vice Chair Terry Dolan, the lender’s chief administration officer, may have died on Sunday afternoon after the plane he was believed to be piloting crashed near Minneapolis. The stock fell about 0.7%. Warner Brothers Discovery CEO David Zaslav has started meeting candidates who could replace film studio heads Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar. The talks are early and no final decision has been made on the two executives’ futures. The stock fell 1.% Monday morning.

U.S. stock futures are plunging as investors review the latest comments from President Donald Trump on tariffs, with more import taxes expected to be announced this Wednesday; Goldman Sachs sees tariffs boosting inflation and slowing economic growth; cryptocurrency-tied stocks Strategy (MSTR), Coinbase (COIN), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are falling in premarket trading along with the price of bitcoin; and Nvidia (NVDA)-backed CoreWeave (CRWV) stock is declining after a flat debut Friday. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are tumbling as investors prepare for Wednesday's tariffs announcements from President Donald Trump. Nasdaq futures are 1.6% lower and S&P 500 futures are down 1.1% after the indexes closed in negative territory Friday for the fifth time in the past six weeks. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are 0.7% lower after also declining last week. Gold futures are jumping to trade at about $3,150 an ounce. Oil futures are edging higher. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are falling below 4.2%. Investors are awaiting updates on tariffs after reports that the Trump administration could expand proposals to include a 20% across-the-board import tax on all U.S. trading partners, according to The Wall Street Journal . The report comes ahead of Wednesday's expected announcement on "reciprocal" tariffs in response to import taxes on U.S.-made goods. Trump told NBC News over the weekend that he "couldn't care less" if proposed automobile tariffs raise prices, arguing it would help promote U.S. car manufacturing. Shares of "Big Three" automakers Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), as well as Tesla (TSLA), are lower in premarket trading. Goldman Sachs economists raised their forecast for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts to three this year and increased their probability of a U.S. recession to 35% from 20%, as President Trump's tariffs put pressure on economic growth. Goldman now sees "core" inflation rising at an annual rate of 3.5% to end 2025, GDP growth slipping to 1%, and U.S. unemployment increasing to 4.5%. "We continue to believe the risk from April 2 tariffs is greater than many market participants have previously assumed," they wrote. Shares of cryptocurrency-related stocks are falling in premarket trading as the price of bitcoin (BTCUSD) trades below $84,000. Bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) stock is down 4% after sinking 10% Friday. Shares of bitcoin mining firms MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT), crypto brokerage Coinbase (COIN), and trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) also are down after posting sharp losses Friday. Shares of cloud computing firm CoreWeave (CRWV) are more than 4% lower in premarket trading after ending flat at their IPO price of $40 per share in their first day of trading. The company's IPO pricing lagged the expected range of $47 to $55 per share. CoreWeave is backed by artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), whose shares are also lower by more than 4% in early trading.

Title: Monica Lewinsky’s Guide to Pulling Off the Perfect April Fool’s Day Prank

Laughter. Oh, how we need laughter these days. The weight of the world is almost too much to bear. The news. The stock market. The price of (fucking) eggs. The fact that the third season of The White Lotus is almost over. Not that anyone asked, but I think April Fools’ Day 2025 is just what we need. (That and a time machine.) Though I was a sweet but serious kid, I always loved April Fools’ Day. Like Pajama Day at school, or my dad’s green pancakes on St. Patrick’s Day, any departure from the quotidian routine gave me a thrill. And that’s never changed. The origins of April Fools’ Day are murky. Some think it arose in the Middle Ages, when the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar shifted New Year’s Day from spring to January 1. Not everyone observes the holiday on April 1, but countries from France and Brazil to Iran and India dedicate at least one calendar day to jokes and pranks. (In Spain, they have an annual food fight.) There’s something heartwarming about a global norm, agreed to across cultures, that celebrates playfulness and laughter. We are so often divided, but laughter can bring us together. But why do I love this day so much? To find out, I did what every good (faux) investigative journalist does: I asked my therapist. Dr. H’s first impulse was to go dark. She said it could reflect unconscious rage or the desire for power in a relationship, since the goal of a prank is to put one over on someone—and laugh at them. I didn’t want to think that could be true of me. Do I have hidden rage lurking in my subconscious? Probably? (Shrug.) But also, what woman doesn’t? The rage theory didn’t land as a puzzle piece sliding into place. Fortunately, as I gave her some of my examples, she laughed and revised her opinion. For me, she said, it might be about connection. I love to laugh, and thinking deeply about how to laugh at somebody and with them is a way of showing I care. The Clinton impeachment sent the little prankster in me into hibernation (a global scandal will do that to ya). But a few years later, I reclaimed my playful side with the help of a friend and neighbor in NYC, Ann. Now Ann pranked people all year long…and she was good. But April Fools’ Day was her Super Bowl. From her I learned the two keys to success: Always start with a kernel of truth, and always go all in on the joke. My inability to keep a straight face was an obstacle, but technology eventually fixed that. Pranking over text became my specialty. So in a feeble attempt to bring some joy to you today, here are Monica Lewinsky’s Greatest April Fools’ Day Hits: The morning of April 1, I sent a group text to my mom, dad, stepmom, brother, and sister-in-law, saying: Morning. There will be an announcement that comes out today. I have my reasons which I’ll explain later, but so you’re not shocked, I decided to do ‘Dancing With the Stars’ Love you. Silence. Then more silence. A few minutes later, I got a call from my mom. My brother had called her worried and apoplectic. “What is she DOING?! She just gave a TED Talk!” (There might have been some expletives in there.) An hour after that, I got a text from my stepmom: “Please call your dad. He has not figured out this is a joke and is worried because with your bad ankles you’re not a great dancer. He’s called me three times.” To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with doing DWTS. It’s just not the obvious next step in taking back your narrative after giving a TED Talk! However you choose to celebrate this April Fools’ Day, I hope you make it a good one and laugh your ass off. Oh, and by the way, since I have this platform here, I was given permission to announce in the pages of Vanity Fair that I’m joining season four of The White Lotus. Location: the White House.

CoinShares' Valkyrie Bitcoin Mining (WGMI) exchange-traded fund (ETF) is the worst-performing ETF of 2025, down 43% year-to-date, according to Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The ETF is made up of several publicly traded bitcoin (BTC) miners. IREN (IREN) is the largest holding at 15%, which is down 42%. Core Scientific (CORZ) follows with a 14% weighting and a 48% decline, while Cipher Mining (CIFR), the third-largest holding at 9.6%, is down 52%. Even NVIDIA (NVDA), the sixth-largest holding at 5%, has dropped over 20% this year. According to its investment strategy, "The ETF will invest in companies that derive at least 50% of their revenue or profits from bitcoin mining operations and/or from providing specialized chips, hardware, software, or other services to companies engaged in bitcoin mining." WGMI consists of 21 holdings and manages $147.2 million in total assets. In contrast, metals ETFs have been the top performers of 2025, according to justETF. Several gold mining ETFs rank in the top five, with the Equity World Basic Materials DAXglobal Gold Miners ETF up 38% year-to-date. Bitcoin miners have faced significant challenges this year, as the network hash rate—representing the computational power required to mine bitcoin—continues to climb, hovering near all-time highs around 832 EH/s. This has created a notable divergence between bitcoin’s price and the hash rate. As a result, mining difficulty has also remained close to its peak, making it harder for miners to successfully mine new bitcoins. At the same time, transaction fees are extremely low, further squeezing miner profitability as rewards from processing transactions remain minimal.

Title: Could The Economy Push American Express Stock Down 50%?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team Contributor. AXP Stock Question: How would you react if you held American Express stock (NYSE: AXP) and its value dropped by 50% or more in the near future? While this might seem dramatic, it's not unprecedented and could occur again. American Express shares have underperformed so far this year, falling 7% since early January, compared to a 3% decline for the S&P 500 over the same period. Despite a stronger-than-expected Q4 2024 performance—driven by increased payment volumes and higher fee-related income—several challenges may lie ahead. Negative sentiment in the market has risen due to fears of a U.S. recession, spurred by tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump on key trade partners. This poses a risk to American Express, given its reliance on consumer spending and international travel trends. Here’s the point: The key message is that in a downturn, American Express stock could suffer significant losses. In 2020, AXP stock lost nearly 50% of its value in just a few quarters and declined about 32% during the 2022 inflation crisis—slightly worse than the S&P 500. This raises the concern: could AXP fall to $135 from the current $270 if similar conditions arise? Naturally, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios. So, if you're aiming for growth with lower volatility, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outpaced the S&P 500 with a total return of over 91% since inception. President Donald Trump’s strict tariff policies—including a 20% tariff on Chinese goods and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as tighter immigration rules—have sparked fears that inflation might return. This suggests the U.S. economy could face major challenges, including a possible recession—see our analysis here on the macro picture. In an interview earlier this month, the President even acknowledged that new tariffs could lead to a recession. Considering the increased uncertainty brought on by these policies, the risks become particularly concerning. In addition, the Ukraine–Russia war and ongoing trade disputes worldwide further cloud the economic horizon. Higher import costs caused by tariffs typically lead to increased prices, which reduce disposable income and dampen consumer spending. This could negatively affect American Express in multiple ways. Rising prices may prompt consumers to reduce discretionary spending, which would hurt transaction volumes on the company’s network. If a recession follows, job losses and declining incomes could reduce spending and payment activity further. Businesses, facing higher expenses, may cut their budgets—resulting in lower corporate expenditures and fewer business-related transactions. American Express has a larger exposure to the travel and entertainment segments than its competitors, and these categories tend to see steeper declines during economic slowdowns. Much of the company’s recent growth has stemmed from increased spending by millennials and Gen Z in these areas. During the holiday quarter, travel and entertainment billings grew by 11%, outpacing the 8% increase seen in goods and services. AXP stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about the impact of a market crash on AXP? Visit our dashboard How Low Can American Express Stock Go In A Market Crash? for an in-depth look at how the stock has behaved in past market crashes. • AXP stock declined 32.0% from a peak of $198.38 on February 16, 2022, to $134.91 on October 2, 2022, compared to a 25.4% drop in the S&P 500 • The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis high by January 26, 2024 • It then climbed to $325.87 on January 23, 2025, and now trades around $270 • AXP stock dropped 49.6% from $136.93 on February 19, 2020, to $68.96 on March 23, 2020, versus a 33.9% fall for the S&P 500 • It recovered fully to its pre-pandemic high by February 23, 2021 • AXP stock plunged 83.8% from $63.23 on October 14, 2007, to $10.26 on March 8, 2009, compared to a 56.8% decline in the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis level by March 5, 2013 At a current price of approximately $270 per share, AXP trades at about 18x expected 2025 earnings—a valuation that appears reasonable. Though the company is seeing steady revenue growth, it’s not spectacular. Analysts expect roughly 8% annual revenue growth for both FY’25 and FY’26. The company's wealthier clientele may provide some cushion during economic slumps, but its strong reliance on discretionary sectors such as travel and entertainment exposes it to risk during downturns. Moreover, American Express has ramped up its marketing spend—jumping 16% in 2024 to roughly $6 billion—which could pressure margins further if the economy weakens. Given the uncertain growth outlook and broader economic risks, ask yourself: Would you continue to hold AXP stock, or would you sell if it starts dropping toward $135 or below? Holding a falling stock is never easy. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston-based wealth advisor—whose asset strategies delivered positive returns during 2008-09, when the S&P dropped more than 40%. Empirical includes the Trefis HQ Portfolio in its asset allocation model to help clients achieve better risk-adjusted returns—offering a smoother experience, as highlighted in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Nvidia Hit Hard By China?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/31/new-chinese-chip-rules-to-hurt-nvidia-stock/
Time Published: 2025-03-31T09:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. NVDA Stock Nvidia stock has fallen around 5% in the past week and is currently down nearly 12% over the last month. So, what has triggered the recent sell-off in Nvidia shares? Nvidia is facing mixed developments in China. According to the Financial Times, China's National Development and Reform Commission has introduced new energy-efficiency standards for advanced chips used in data centers. These new regulations could effectively prevent Nvidia’s H20 chip from being used by Chinese firms expanding or building new data centers. The H20 is Nvidia’s leading chip tailored for China, featuring scaled-back capabilities to comply with U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductors. Compared to Nvidia’s top-tier Blackwell processors available elsewhere, the H20 is less advanced. Resellers operating in the gray market have reportedly been using entities registered outside of China to acquire Nvidia’s newest chips, including the Blackwell GPUs—which are prohibited from being sold to Chinese customers—via companies based in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Recently, Singapore charged three individuals in connection with a fraud case involving the suspected resale of Nvidia chips through Malaysia to China. Under pressure from the U.S., Malaysia is now working with both the U.S. and Singapore to monitor the distribution of Nvidia’s high-end chips and to strengthen semiconductor regulations. These concerns are particularly noteworthy, as Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, contributing approximately $23 billion in revenue for FY’25 (ended January 26), accounting for 18% of total sales—an increase from $2.3 billion, or about 8% of revenue, in FY’23. In contrast, China officially made up 13% of revenue in FY’25. Increased regulatory attention on these transactions could have implications for Nvidia stock. There is increasing skepticism about the sustainability of the current AI spending surge. Evidence suggests that the massive capital allocation by major U.S. tech companies could begin to taper. In January, Chinese startup DeepSeek introduced an AI model that operates at a significantly lower cost than those of most Western competitors. This development could encourage companies to shift away from hardware-heavy strategies and focus on more efficient solutions. Moreover, returns from AI investments have been underwhelming so far, causing concern among investors—particularly if the U.S. economy weakens. With inflation expected to rise again and economic growth potentially slowing under new tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump, market apprehensions are growing. Reports this week noted that Microsoft canceled several data center projects across the U.S. and Europe in the last six months, citing demand not matching supply. Meanwhile, Alibaba’s Chairman Joe Tsai also recently warned of a potential bubble in AI and data center investments. The increase in NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index, less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months – or will it see a strong jump? We currently value Nvidia stock at around $101 per share, which is roughly 10% below its current market price of $112. See our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap. There are several reasons behind our slightly bearish view on the stock right now. One is the potential decline in the “fear-of-missing-out” driven AI rally seen over the past two years, due to diminishing performance returns from increasingly large models and challenges in accessing high-quality training data. A transition toward more efficient AI models could amplify headwinds for GPU producers like Nvidia. Additionally, Nvidia may encounter increased competition from companies such as AMD and even some of its own customers like Amazon, which are developing and deploying proprietary AI chips. While Nvidia benefits from a strong software ecosystem that complements its AI hardware—helping retain customers—it may still face pressures. At its current premium valuation, the stock might not fully account for these risks.

Title: Webscale Market Review Report 4Q 2024: AI and Data Center Investments Push Webscale Capex Past $300 Billion in 4Q24

March 31, 2025 04:03 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, March 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Webscale Market Review, 4Q24: Annual capex breaks the $300B mark" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report reviews the growth and development of the webscale network operator (webscale, aka hyperscale) market since 2011. The webscale market consists of big tech providers building large networks of data centers as part of their operations. The webscale tracker covers 22 companies. In 2024, webscalers represented $2.596 trillion (T) in revenues (+9.4% YoY), $314 billion (B) in R&D spending (+7.1% YoY), and $304B in capex (+55.5% YoY). They had $643B of cash and short-term investments (-5.3% YoY) on the books as of December 2024, and $545B in total debt (-3.4% YoY). The value of webscalers' net plant, property & equipment (net PP&E) on the books as of December 2024 was $922B, up 28.3% YoY. Webscalers employed approximately 4.234 million (M) people at the end of 4Q24, up 1.2% from the Dec. 2023 total of 4.185M. Below are highlights from the report: Revenues: Single quarter revenues in 4Q24 were $745.3 billion (B), up 9.9% YoY. That pushed annualized revenues to $2.596 trillion. Topline growth has been driven by the big 4: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (FB) and Microsoft. For six straight quarters, all of these companies have recorded double digit revenue growth. For the 4Q24 annualized period, among larger companies, the fastest growth came from Meta, up 21.9% versus 2023, followed by Microsoft (+15.0%), Alphabet (13.9%), and Amazon (11.0%). The biggest dollar impact on growth in 4Q24 came from Amazon, as its single quarter revenues grew $17.8 billion from 4Q23 to end 4Q24 at $187.8B, up 10.5% YoY. The only curbs on growth in 4Q24 were Japanese IT services & cloud vendor Fujitsu and Chinese search specialist Baidu, both of which reported modest declines. Capex: After declining 3% in 2023, webscale capex grew at incredibly fast, unsustainable rates in 2024: up by 26%, 53%, 61%, and 78% YoY in the four quarters of the year. 4Q24 capex of $100.2B pushed the annualized total to $304.4B, up 56% YoY, and another all-time high. Investor interest in generative AI has spread rapidly, driving GPU spend in the data center. Some companies claim they are struggling to procure all the GPUs they want, and prices are unusually high, both due to NVIDIA's market power. The current investment spike would seem to be inspired by a mix of hype and fear of missing out, as GenAI brings with it a plethora of legal & regulatory risks and relative lack of proven business models. Most recent webscale capex is focused on outfitting existing data centers: from 48% of annualized capex in 2022, Network/IT and software capex was 60% of total capex in 2024. The biggest capex outlays in 4Q24 came from Amazon ($27.8B), Microsoft ($15.8B), Meta ($14.4B), and Alphabet ($14.3B). These four account for over 70% of single quarter spending. They are the reason behind the surge in the price of NVIDIA stock. Profitability: Webscale free cash flow margins averaged out to 16.3% in 2024, a bit lower than the 18.6% average of 2023. Average net profit margin for 2024 was 19.9%, a bit higher than 17.5% in 2023. Net margins are around the same level as in the year before COVID, but free cash flow margins have dropped recently due to high capex spend. Meta, Tencent and Microsoft were 1-2-3 for FCF margins in 2024 overall. The ecommerce specialists Amazon and Alibaba are the laggards, as usual. In gauging webscalers' ability to fund their capex, their recent levels of free cash flow profitability is one factor to consider. The overall level of average margins is a bit low relative to history, and it's moving in the wrong direction. Webscalers can afford this for a few quarters, but not for a few years. Employees: Headcount in the webscale market totaled to 4.23 million in December 2024, slightly up from 4.185 million in December 2023. This difference is negligible, considering the size of some of the webscalers and how quickly the ecommerce specialists in particular can change workforce levels. Total webscale headcount has been approximately 4.1 to 4.2 million or so steadily since late 2021. Some of the biggest webscalers are investing heavily in AI and GenAI, with one clear goal being to improve their internal cost efficiencies. This inevitably will mean fewer employees. Even within the ecommerce space, there is a rising use of robots and autonomous vehicles in the logistics chain. Per our latest forecast, we expect webscale employment to rise slightly in 2025 but decline thereafter due to greater use of robotics, automation and AI. Regional trends: The Asia-Pacific region has been a drag on the market for several quarters, and that continued in 4Q24. Webscale revenues in the Americas, Europe, and MEA have been growing in the low double digit range for a few quarters, but AP has been weak: 4Q24 revenue growth was 6% YoY, in line with the last few quarters of low single digit percentage growth. Weak Asian currencies and a very competitive 'big tech' market in China account for the gap. Asia should have a good 2025, though. Both Tencent and Alibaba appear to have strong government support to expand and grow tech spending over the next 2-3 years. That should help to accelerate Asian regional growth.

Title: AI's "Biggest Test" Is Turning Into a Catastrophe as CoreWeave Flounders
URL: https://futurism.com/ai-test-coreweave
Time Published: 2025-03-31T00:48:52Z
Full Content:
So far, the AI industry has enjoyed smooth sailing. It's courted billions in slap-happy investments and sign-first, read-later contracts, ballooning some Silicon Valley companies to the top of the financial food chain. Now it's facing its toughest challenge yet in the form of CoreWeave, the AI processing company that went public on the stock market this week and the first all-AI startup to do so. It was said to be a major test for the industry — and so far it's failing, miserably. CoreWeave stocks hit the public market with a wet thud on Friday, opening at $39, down slightly from its IPO price of $40 per share, which was already reduced from the highest projection of $55 per share the previous week. The company's hopes of raising $4 billion in the offering thus fell way short at a soggy $1.5 billion. That flat opening helped spurn a rough day for the Magnificent 7 — the term used to describe Google, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft — which all tumbled following announcements of Donald Trump's auto tariffs. Nvidia, the chip giant that's tried to prop up CoreWeave, saw its stock price fall 1.5 percent on Friday, after a 2.1 percent fall on Thursday. Apple, meanwhile, fell 2.5 percent, while Amazon tumbled 4.5 percent, and Tesla dived 3.7 ahead of worldwide protests aimed at CEO Elon Musk. Though CoreWeave isn't entirely to blame for the M7's terrible rotten day, its failure to instill faith in the tech industry and stave off mounting losses still feels like a big deal. The company's entire business model hinges on the mass adoption of generative AI — a resource-intensive technology whose main impact so far has been polluting the internet with computer generated slop. If CoreWeave does well, it would be a major boost for the tech industry, kicking off even more demand for chips and a wave of AI IPOs. However, if CoreWeave can't survive despite the massive contracts it has with Microsoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia, then investors will have little reason to trust the generative AI hype going forward — something many have questioned after the Chinese AI company DeepSeek suggested a sustainable alternative to US AI development. And unfortunately for American AI hopefuls, there's little reason to think CoreWeave can hold out the next six months, let alone lead the AI revolution. As tech critic Ed Zitron notes, CoreWeave is a company primed for disaster. Its business is far from stable, relying on those huge revenue injections over sustainable, diversified income. According to the company's financial filings, 77 percent of CoreWeave's revenue comes from just two customers — meaning the company could collapse like a house of cards if just one of its clients cancels a contract. Meanwhile, it has what Zitron calls a "fatal amount of debt" via loans from companies like Blackstone and Magnetar. The interest alone on CoreWeave's top two loans could be as much as $1.5 billion per year thanks to some high-risk terms, suggesting a lack of faith from the company's lenders. All told, it's a pretty lame showing given all the hype we've heard from AI tycoons. The next few months will tell whether they can keep CoreWeave — and the AI industry — afloat as the market grows impatient with empty promises.

A tweet or a regulatory shift can send prices soaring, while unexpected market shocks like trade wars can wipe out billions of dollars in minutes. This volatility is behind two key terms that define cryptocurrency market cycles: bull and bear markets. Understanding these trends isn’t just about knowing when to buy or sell—it’s about survival. The differences between a bull and bear market are simple yet complex. A bull market fuels optimism, risk-taking, and price surges, while a bear market brings fear, sell-offs, and a test of investor resilience. This article will explain what defines these market conditions, and how they impact cryptocurrency. The terms "bull market" and "bear market" date back to the 18th century. A bull charges with its horns upward, symbolizing rising prices, while a bear swipes downward, representing a market decline. In traditional equities markets, a bull market is generally defined as a sustained period of rising stock prices, typically lasting months or years, with gains of 20% or more. With a few key differences, bull and bear markets in crypto function much the same as traditional finance. Unlike legacy markets, however, crypto cycles are amplified by: Cryptocurrency investors rely on technical, macroeconomic, and on-chain analysis to identify trends and effectively navigate market cycles. “Standard technical analysis tools like moving averages, Relative Strength Index, and Bollinger Bands, can help signal cyclical shifts along with correlated markets such as the NASDAQ and Tech Stocks,” Mike Marshall, Amberdata’s head of research, told Decrypt. “Additionally, macro factors, including Fed policy, inflation, and global events, also heavily influence crypto cycles.” On January 20, 2025, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $108,786, spurred on by the hope of a friendlier regulatory environment in the United States under newly re-elected President Donald Trump, who had promised the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Some analysts speculated that the industry was in a bull market, with some even calling it a 'supercycle'—a prolonged period of economic expansion driven by sustained demand and investor optimism. However, that narrative was challenged when Bitcoin tumbled more than 31% to nearly $73,000 two months later. “Everyone seemed to be saying that when the Trump administration comes in, it's going to give such a huge boost to crypto regulations,” Alice Liu, Head of Research at CoinMarketCap, told Decrypt at ETH Denver. “But so far, we haven't seen that play out in action.” However, as Liu explained, this drop in Bitcoin’s price did not necessarily mean a bear market had taken over. “This is a technical pullback as opposed to a structural change. The reason for that is the liquidity is still healthy,” she said. Liquidity—how easily assets can be bought and sold without significantly impacting price—is key in distinguishing bull and bear markets. High liquidity indicates a market where transactions occur smoothly, with minimal price volatility, due to a large number of active buyers and sellers. In bear markets, liquidity tends to dry up as trading slows, amplifying price volatility. “Even in reaction to the market shock, we saw a definite spike in trade volume, averaging around $150 million to $160 million daily,” Liu said. “And even now, as the dust has settled a little, we still see a healthy trade volume moving through the market.” Defining the start of a Bitcoin bull market isn’t always straightforward, since different analysts use varying metrics to pinpoint its beginning. Some argue that it starts when prices recover from a major downturn, while others believe it only becomes clear once previous all-time highs are surpassed. “Technically, one could say the bull market begins with capitulation, as prices start to rise, but most people only perceive a bull market in Bitcoin after the prior all-time high is reached until the bubble pops about a year later,” Michael Terpin, founder and CEO of Transform Ventures, told Decrypt. Capitulation is when an investor, often driven by fear or panic, gives up on trying to recover losses and sells their assets. This typically happens after a prolonged market downturn triggered by a massive event, like the collapse of FTX in November 2022. Investors who hold onto their cryptocurrency despite being in a bear market, and mounting pressures to sell, are considered to have “diamond hands.” The term "diamond hands" originated in 2018 on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. Not all financial analysts agree that a 20% swing should be considered the standard for measuring whether a market is in bull or bear territory. “I think the typical 20% threshold that’s commonly used to define bull and bear markets in traditional finance may not be as applicable to crypto, due to the wider price moves in the latter and the 24/7 trading that makes crypto more sensitive to global events,” Coinbase Head of Institutional Research David Duong told Decrypt. As Duong explained, crypto is often used as a proxy when traditional markets are closed, increasing the magnitude of the reaction to crypto prices. “I’d be more inclined to use metrics like the 200-day moving average, in combination with measuring the sustainability of the given upside or downside move,” he said. “For example, how long the move lasts to define a bull or bear market.” While crypto markets share similarities with traditional financial markets, they have unique characteristics—including extreme volatility, higher sensitivity to hype, and regulatory changes that set them apart. “When it comes to cryptocurrency-specific technical indicators, I prefer the Market Value to Realized Value ratio or the MVRV z-score to gauge how markets are moving,” Duong said. Investor sentiment plays an important role in shaping market cycles, with various indicators offering insights into broad trends. Measures like the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), the Put/Call Ratio, and the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Sentiment Survey help gauge investor confidence and risk appetite. One widely followed metric, the Fear and Greed Index, aggregates market factors to assess whether investors lean toward caution or excitement. The Fear and Greed Index ranges from 0 to 100, with lower values indicating fear, suggesting cautious or bearish investor sentiment, and higher values reflecting greed, signaling optimism or bullish market behavior. On March 30, 2025, as of this writing, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stood at 32 (Fear), up from 17 (Extreme Fear) earlier in the month. While such indices don’t predict price movements, they often reflect broader shifts in investor thinking. “Investors often look to sentiment as a key indicator to assess whether markets are nearing a top or bottom,” Joe Vezzani, CEO and co-founder of crypto sentiment aggregator LunarCrush, told Decrypt. “Current crypto market sentiment reached its lowest point since August 2024, when volatility spiked due to the unwinding of the yen carry trade.” For financial analyst Jacob King, founder and CEO of WhaleWire, market sentiment also depends on whether investors believe the data. “Indicators exist—if you trust the data, which is questionable,” King told Decrypt. “Bitcoin falling below the 200-day moving average is a major red flag. When bulls fail to hold that line, the market structure weakens, and declines accelerate.” Markets go through natural growth and decline cycles. While no strategy guarantees success, those who take a long-term, well-researched approach are better positioned to navigate financial uncertainties. “It's important to note that what defines a bull market in crypto today isn’t just price—it’s utility, infrastructure maturity, and institutional participation,” Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, told Decrypt. “When it comes down to it, the key indicators are transaction volume acceleration, fee growth, stablecoin velocity, and capital formation on-chain.

View all partners The first months of Donald Trump’s presidency have been defined by a single word: tariffs. He has framed tariffs as a panacea to the woes of the American economy, promising they will restore the country’s manufacturing sector and reduce the national deficit. As the United States’ largest trading partner, Canada’s smaller economy is poised to suffer the most from a prolonged trade war. Although the price of all consumer goods will be affected, the grocery aisle has become a particular battleground. Canadians have remained defiant, with vows to “buy Canadian” already spurring rapid drops in the sale of American products. But with calls for the country to strengthen its economic backbone and reduce dependence on the U.S., perhaps it’s also time to consider rebooting Canada’s grocery sector to better serve Canadians as well. Read more: Canada is now in a trade war with the U.S. — here's what you need to know to prepare for it Rising grocery bills have been an ongoing concern for Canadians long before Trump’s inauguration. Today, an estimated 18 per cent of Canadians are struggling with food insecurity owing to persistent inflation and the rising cost of living. Food banks saw a record number of monthly visits in 2024 as a result. Yet, even as consumers feel the squeeze, Canada’s grocery giants have been posting record profits. Loblaw Companies Limited, whose supermarkets hold a dominant 28 per cent share of the sector, has become the poster child for this trend. In the final quarter of 2022, as Canadians were grappling with rapid inflation on their grocery bills, Loblaw posted $529 million in profits — up 30 per cent from the previous year. This has led customers to accuse Loblaw and other large grocery chains of profiteering, provoking both a 100,000 signature petition against “greedflation” and a month-long boycott of Loblaw chains. All this while Loblaw was still reeling from a bread price-fixing scandal yielding a $500 million antitrust settlement. Read more: Food giants reap enormous profits during times of crisis In response to the mounting concerns, the federal government met with the heads of Loblaw, Sobeys, Metro, Costco and Walmart in 2023 to discuss stabilizing grocery prices in Canada. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would threaten and later implement amendments to the Competition Act through Bill C-56, although these reforms were focused less on immediately lowering grocery bills and more on giving new tools to Canada’s competition watchdog. Another area of concern is the initiatives supermarket chains such as Loblaw and Metro have been investing their profits in. Since 2020, supermarkets in Canada have invested heavily in self-checkout aisles. While initially a concession to the social distancing measures of the COVID-19 pandemic, these kiosks have become a ubiquitous — and often unwelcome — part of the retail experience for both workers and consumers. Beyond the concern that self-checkouts pressure customers to perform more work, they have also increased the precarity of supermarket employees. These technologies generally reduce total worker hours and eliminate well-paying full-time positions, all with an eye towards boosting profit margins.

Loblaw has also invested in automating their fleet of delivery vehicles, jeopardizing jobs in the logistics sector at a time when Canada’s unemployment rate, already struggling to recover, is expected to rise due to Trump’s tariffs. There is also the looming concern of dynamic pricing. Following the lead of American grocery stores such as Kroger, chains run by Loblaw, Metro and Sobeys have begun to implement electronic price tags. These tags enable retailers to instantaneously update prices based on supply and demand, similar to surge pricing on ride-sharing apps like Uber. While online commentators were quick to mock fast food chain Wendy’s for potentially using dynamic pricing to charge more for a Frosty on a hot day, this practice becomes more problematic as the availability of family staples like baby formula, which already experiences perennial scarcity, are affected by the trade war. There is little reason to believe Canada’s grocery industry will reform itself. Many of the pro-consumer and pro-worker initiatives put forth by these chains have amounted to little more than public relations moves. The much-lauded COVID hero pay for front-line grocery workers disappeared only months into the pandemic, despite pressure from unions and MPs during the Omicron wave. Loblaw’s widely publicized price freeze on No Name products was similarly criticised for its short duration and for merely repackaging seasonal price freezes as a pro-consumer initiative. The company’s promise to create a discounted version of its already discounted grocery chain No Frills drew further scepticism, with the stock being entirely sourced from Loblaw brands that generate higher revenue for the company. The question remains: what concrete measures can be implemented to safeguard Canadian grocery bills as our country navigates this next crisis? A report from the Broadbent Institute suggests the idea of a windfall profit tax, which would incentivize grocery companies to invest excess profits into price reductions or higher wages. A more durable reform would involve creating a central bank-style regulatory entity to oversee the grocery industry, instead of relying on industry-born measures such as Canada’s recently introduced grocery code of conduct. Read more: The new Grocery Code of Conduct should benefit both Canadians and the food industry Federal or provincial legislation could be also passed that places guardrails on dynamic pricing in the grocery aisle, if not banning the controversial practice altogether. Government grants and tax incentive programs could be withheld from companies that invest heavily into automating workforces so the government isn’t inadvertently subsidizing job losses. The Competition Bureau’s 2023 report highlights another key issue: there is a need for all levels of government to shift from subsidizing large chains and encourage the growth of independent grocers in the Canadian market, driving down prices for consumers through meaningful, local competition.

Title: Liberation Day: Market Implications Of Tariffs

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. According to Strategas Research Partners, the size of the contemplated tariffs to be announced on ... More Wednesday could bring the total to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) While the economic data was a bit softer on the margin last week, markets were likely rattled more by concerns about the upcoming tariff announcements on President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day,” scheduled for Wednesday, April 2. Though the range of possible outcomes is extensive, the scope and size of the tariffs should be meaningful. Goldman Sachs estimates a five-percentage-point increase in tariffs trims 1% to 2% from S&P 500 earnings growth. So, Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 earnings per share growth estimate to 7%. Strategas Research Partners notes that the size of the contemplated tariffs could bring the total size to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union as a group account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Following COVID-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have made progress in diversifying away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., making it likely to remain subject to significant and possibly increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they are targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with many large trading partners as their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP. If sizable tariffs crimp their net exports to the U.S., as would be expected, their economic growth will suffer. The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs this week. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region. If value-added taxes are included in the reciprocal calculation by the administration, then the tariffs on the European Union will be significantly higher than if only their tariff rates are considered. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S. President Trump’s use of tariffs and threats of additional tariffs has added to the policy uncertainty. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. As we have experienced since mid-February, all other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas Research Partners, stocks usually do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. The poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen, but the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty After a 1.5% decline last week, the S&P 500 sits 9.2% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a plunge of 20.5% since mid-December. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness and that stress intensified last week. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks isn’t yet at levels seen before past recessions. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Beyond Wednesday’s highly anticipated tariff announcements, Friday’s monthly jobs release will be an important marker. If job growth continues, there will be less concern about any drag from increased tariffs pushing the economy into recession. The March unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, but growth in nonfarm payrolls and hours worked should be closely watched for signs of further softness. U.S. Unemployment Rate While the Federal Reserve projects two rate cuts, markets expect three for 2025, with the first in mid-June. These expectations could change quickly depending on this week’s releases. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected If you own your stocks as an investment — just like you’d own an apartment, house, or a farm — look at them as a business. – Warren Buffett Warren Buffett’s mentor, Benjamin Graham, taught him much about investing. Graham’s most essential lessons were to analyze stocks as a business and not react to short-term fluctuations in the quoted price of a stock. Buffett has said that chapters eight and twenty of Benjamin Graham’s “The Intelligent Investor” book are the bedrock of his investment process. Graham thought investors should look at stock holdings as owning a part of various businesses, like being a “silent partner” in a private company. Hence, stocks should be valued as a portion of the company’s intrinsic value, not as something constantly changing in price on the stock market. An investor should take advantage of the stock market’s fickle view of a company or concerns about macroeconomic factors rather than allowing it to dictate what one should do. Valuing stocks as a business and purchasing stock with a “margin of safety” enable investors to ignore the market’s emotional ups and downs. For Graham, the “margin of safety” meant buying at a price below the “indicated or appraised value,” which should allow an investment to provide a reasonable return even if there are errors in the analysis. The recent market turmoil makes it an optimal time to revisit investment first principles. Given the growing downside risk to the economy and the current inflationary environment, investors should find comfort in owning quality companies with pricing power when searching for opportunities during any selloff. Quality is defined as high returns on capital, consistent earnings, and low debt levels, which should help the company survive a possible economic slowdown or tariff-related challenges. For example, consider Constellation Brands (STZ), which is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S. It also owns some wine and spirits brands, but beer accounts for about 80% of its sales. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its beer earnings since almost all its beer is produced in Mexico. It seems unlikely that a tariff headwind will erode the long-term value of its beer brands, even if profitability could be dented in the short term. Corona and Modelo have two of the best growth profiles among beer brands, and alcohol consumption tends to remain relatively unscathed by economic downturns. Notably, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on long-term alcohol consumption which could be a structural headwind. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Constellation boasts a solid balance sheet and free cash flow generation to sustain it through a possible recession or tariff-related disruption. Just as the zenith of economic and earnings optimism in early 2025 gave way to creeping concerns about the durability of growth under pressure from possible tariff increases, maximum pessimism will eventually give way to a better reality. History tells us that better stock returns follow maximum policy uncertainty. Whether next week’s tariff announcement provides that bottom is unclear, but markets have shifted from pricing in a benign environment to a more difficult path. Current data points to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. Macroeconomic forecasting is fraught, so one should still admit that the odds of a recession have risen, and no one truly knows the eventual outcome. Though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies, and the tariffs can be reduced in the short term. In addition, the focus could shift to more market-friendly topics of tax cuts and deregulation. In any case, investors must always deal with uncertainty and unpredictable market volatility. Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham have provided a better blueprint for dealing with this by focusing on the health and valuation of the underlying businesses rather than the macroeconomic environment or the movement of stock prices. This focus doesn’t avoid the volatility but allows one to use it to their advantage if executed correctly. Just as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) keeps more than enough cash to pay insurance claims without touching any stock investments, investors should have enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses to ignore any depressive states of the stock market and perhaps benefit from taking advantage when they invariably occur.

If value-added taxes are included in the reciprocal calculation by the administration, then the tariffs on the European Union will be significantly higher than if only their tariff rates are considered. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S. President Trump’s use of tariffs and threats of additional tariffs has added to the policy uncertainty. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. As we have experienced since mid-February, all other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas Research Partners, stocks usually do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. The poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen, but the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty After a 1.5% decline last week, the S&P 500 sits 9.2% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a plunge of 20.5% since mid-December. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness and that stress intensified last week. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks isn’t yet at levels seen before past recessions. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Beyond Wednesday’s highly anticipated tariff announcements, Friday’s monthly jobs release will be an important marker. If job growth continues, there will be less concern about any drag from increased tariffs pushing the economy into recession. The March unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, but growth in nonfarm payrolls and hours worked should be closely watched for signs of further softness. U.S. Unemployment Rate While the Federal Reserve projects two rate cuts, markets expect three for 2025, with the first in mid-June. These expectations could change quickly depending on this week’s releases. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected If you own your stocks as an investment — just like you’d own an apartment, house, or a farm — look at them as a business. – Warren Buffett Warren Buffett’s mentor, Benjamin Graham, taught him much about investing. Graham’s most essential lessons were to analyze stocks as a business and not react to short-term fluctuations in the quoted price of a stock. Buffett has said that chapters eight and twenty of Benjamin Graham’s “The Intelligent Investor” book are the bedrock of his investment process. Graham thought investors should look at stock holdings as owning a part of various businesses, like being a “silent partner” in a private company. Hence, stocks should be valued as a portion of the company’s intrinsic value, not as something constantly changing in price on the stock market. An investor should take advantage of the stock market’s fickle view of a company or concerns about macroeconomic factors rather than allowing it to dictate what one should do. Valuing stocks as a business and purchasing stock with a “margin of safety” enable investors to ignore the market’s emotional ups and downs. For Graham, the “margin of safety” meant buying at a price below the “indicated or appraised value,” which should allow an investment to provide a reasonable return even if there are errors in the analysis. The recent market turmoil makes it an optimal time to revisit investment first principles. Given the growing downside risk to the economy and the current inflationary environment, investors should find comfort in owning quality companies with pricing power when searching for opportunities during any selloff. Quality is defined as high returns on capital, consistent earnings, and low debt levels, which should help the company survive a possible economic slowdown or tariff-related challenges. For example, consider Constellation Brands (STZ), which is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S. It also owns some wine and spirits brands, but beer accounts for about 80% of its sales. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its beer earnings since almost all its beer is produced in Mexico. It seems unlikely that a tariff headwind will erode the long-term value of its beer brands, even if profitability could be dented in the short term. Corona and Modelo have two of the best growth profiles among beer brands, and alcohol consumption tends to remain relatively unscathed by economic downturns. Notably, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on long-term alcohol consumption which could be a structural headwind. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Constellation boasts a solid balance sheet and free cash flow generation to sustain it through a possible recession or tariff-related disruption. Just as the zenith of economic and earnings optimism in early 2025 gave way to creeping concerns about the durability of growth under pressure from possible tariff increases, maximum pessimism will eventually give way to a better reality. History tells us that better stock returns follow maximum policy uncertainty. Whether next week’s tariff announcement provides that bottom is unclear, but markets have shifted from pricing in a benign environment to a more difficult path. Current data points to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. Macroeconomic forecasting is fraught, so one should still admit that the odds of a recession have risen, and no one truly knows the eventual outcome. Though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies, and the tariffs can be reduced in the short term. In addition, the focus could shift to more market-friendly topics of tax cuts and deregulation. In any case, investors must always deal with uncertainty and unpredictable market volatility. Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham have provided a better blueprint for dealing with this by focusing on the health and valuation of the underlying businesses rather than the macroeconomic environment or the movement of stock prices. This focus doesn’t avoid the volatility but allows one to use it to their advantage if executed correctly. Just as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) keeps more than enough cash to pay insurance claims without touching any stock investments, investors should have enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses to ignore any depressive states of the stock market and perhaps benefit from taking advantage when they invariably occur.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

(“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. With "Signalgate" dominating headlines, BI's Katie Notopoulos wants to know: Which high-ranking official's group chat texting style most matches yours? Let her know here for an upcoming story! On the agenda today: But first: Googlers have questions. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. We've written a lot about the tech industry's hardcore moment. Talk of efficiency and intensity has replaced perks and pampering. Rolling layoffs have become the norm. Management layers are thinning. AI can help companies do more with less. Now, at least at Google, some employees aren't pleased about their recent compensation packages. And they're speaking out about it. Some Google employees received smaller pay bumps in their 2025 compensation packages than they anticipated, according to an exclusive report from my BI colleague Hugh Langley. Googlers raised the issue at a recent company all-hands, per a meeting transcript that Hugh obtained, where they wondered why some employees had seen a decrease in their refreshed stock grants and overall comp. A Google exec at the all-hands said some employees in less technical roles received smaller equity packages this year to calibrate pay to local markets. But the story got me thinking about how Google's lower comp fits into the changing tech industry. I spoke with Hugh about his reporting and what it means for Google. Steve: What's the reaction to your scoop? Hugh: Whenever I write about compensation, I get a lot of feedback from employees across Big Tech. I know some of these stories can have a "world's smallest violin" feeling to them — Googlers, on the whole, are still paid very well! But in the battle for talent, this stuff really matters. What impact do you see this having on Google's workforce? The fact it got raised during the company's all-hands means it's on a lot of employees' minds. The biggest possible impact is a hit to morale, especially for employees in non-technical roles that have been dinged hardest. As the tech industry becomes more hardcore about work, how do you see Google fitting into that overall trend? Google is certainly going hardcore, but in typical Google fashion, it's doing it less dramatically, less publicly, and without any of the political chest-thumping we've seen from the likes of Meta. Googlers once felt they were the only ones safe from layoffs, but now rolling job cuts have become the new norm. It's also chopped away at management layers and in some cases set a higher bar for performance. Of course, there are plenty of employees who see this all as a good thing, but there's a feeling among many staff that the era of mollycoddling at Alphabet is well and truly over. Many assumed Elon Musk's proximity to President Donald Trump would be a net positive — but the opposite has proven to be true. Musk's involvement with DOGE has triggered an identity crisis within Tesla. Over the years, Tesla and its CEO have faced dire predictions, but each time they seem to have emerged stronger. However, for some employees, analysts, and investors, Musk's political entanglements represent a new challenge. Why this time feels different. Also read: The business of buying and selling companies is slowing down. Buyout funds recently underperformed the stock market for the first time in decades. But that doesn't mean PE vets and newcomers have to fret. Certain opportunities are in demand, and — if you're more junior — there's good news for you, too. What to know about PE careers. Since CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg started calling for more "masculine energy" in the workplace, a small group of their female colleagues has been organizing their resistance. Some female executives worry that big business's latest testosterone injection could push them out of leadership roles. Others see it as galvanizing, a sign that women are making serious progress. "The masks and the gloves are off." "If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too." That's how one person justifies stealing little treats from Whole Foods. Middle-class shoplifters and thieves of opportunity are fudging Amazon returns and sneaking Whole Foods goods to stick it to The Man — whose name, in this case, is Jeff Bezos. The problem is that small-time swiping doesn't actually effect the change these anti-Amazon avengers want to see. Worse, it could be causing unintended harm. This week's quote: "We are catching a lot of balls, with very little people. Eventually one of them is probably going to fall." — A NOAA employee concerned about how DOGE's job cuts at the agency will affect extreme weather alerts and air travel forecasts.

A strong PMI reading could lift market sentiment, while a weaker-than-expected figure might dampen it. Auto sales data for March, typically released by companies early in the month, will be in focus. Given the festive season’s tail-end effects and economic activity, robust sales numbers could support auto stocks and broader market indices. Global Economic Influences: Key U.S. economic data, including the Composite PMI and Initial Jobless Claims, expected during the week, could sway global markets, including India. Strong U.S. data might bolster confidence, while signs of weakness could fuel volatility, especially amid ongoing tariff concerns. The looming U.S. reciprocal tariffs, set to be detailed on April 2, are a significant wildcard. Proposed by the Trump administration, these tariffs (e.g., 25% on auto imports) could impact Indian exporters, particularly in the auto and manufacturing sectors, potentially triggering a cautious market response. Domestic Market Dynamics: Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) flows will remain critical. After being net sellers of ₹1.4 lakh crore in FY25 so far (as of late March), any shift in FII behavior—driven by global cues or domestic data—could move indices like the Sensex and Nifty. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) next monetary policy decision is slated for April, with speculation of a 25-basis-point repo rate cut. While the decision itself falls outside next week, any preemptive signals or market expectations could influence sentiment. Corporate and Sectoral Updates: The last day of the financial year (March 31) will see final portfolio adjustments, potentially affecting stock closing prices. This could lead to heightened volatility on Monday. Early Q4 earnings updates or guidance from companies might start trickling in, setting the tone for sector-specific movements. Technical and Sentiment Factors: The Nifty’s recent performance, closing below key levels like 23,550 (as noted in some analyses), suggests bearish pressure. Market participants will watch if it holds above 23,500 or tests lower supports around 22,400, as predicted by some traders. In summary, the Indian stock market next week will likely be shaped by a mix of domestic economic indicators (PMI, auto sales), global developments (U.S. data, tariffs), and technical levels. Investors might adopt a wait-and-see approach, balancing optimism from potential rate cut expectations against risks from international trade tensions. Keep an eye on these events as they unfold for a clearer picture. There are sectors in which it may make sense to chase expensive stocks; Power is not one of them. Indian electric utilities and IPPs face structural power demand growth and a much tighter demand-supply balance for peak power. This is leading to an expanded thermal capex opportunity (benefiting NTPC) and transmission capex opportunity (benefiting PGCIL). The industry has consolidated after a brutal decade in the 2010s, which saw many bankruptcies, leaving the survivors to benefit from rebounding growth. However, power is a tough sector – multiple challenges persist, such as the weak financial health of DISCOMs, delays in the signing of renewable PPAs, the usual execution delays and regulatory interventions. Post-Covid, stocks have re-rated sharply due to strong power demand growth, the resolution of DISCOM payment delays and high trading multiples accorded to renewable growth prospects. The correction in valuations over the past six months has reduced the ‘froth’ in valuations, putting the valuations of regulated utilities (NTPC & PGCIL) in an acceptable zone, in our view. However, we find private IPP/utility valuations still somewhat expensive, especially given execution challenges. We initiate coverage of NTPC and PGCIL at OW, Tata Power and Torrent Power at Neutral, and JSWEL at UW. 📌Piramal Pharma - Out of the 151 molecules in various stages of development, 12 are in preclinical, 68 in Phase-I trials, 38 in Phase-II trials, and 33 are in Phase-III clinical trials.

Central to Rocket Lab's participation is its next-generation Neutron rocket, a reusable carbon composite launch vehicle engineered for medium-lift missions. Neutron is designed to deliver up to 13,000 kilograms to orbit, supporting both single-payload missions and multi-satellite constellation deployments. Built on Rocket Lab's track record of reliability-with 63 Electron launches completed and multiple orbital payload deliveries in 2025 alone-Neutron is positioned as a competitive contender in the defense launch market. Neutron's inaugural launch is scheduled for the latter half of 2025 from Launch Complex 3 at Wallops Island, Virginia. With this mission, Neutron will become the first vehicle to support NSSL operations from the Mid-Atlantic region. Rocket Lab's inclusion in the program required meeting stringent eligibility standards, and a successful debut flight will make the company eligible to receive individual task orders for NSSL missions. The NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 program aims to cultivate a diversified and resilient domestic launch capability, selecting just five companies to compete for up to 30 missions through 2029, with a potential extension to 2034. As part of its onboarding, Rocket Lab has secured a $5 million task order to demonstrate its mission assurance framework tailored for national security launches. "Supporting assured access to space for the nation's most important missions has always been the goal with our Neutron rocket, and we're incredibly proud to [be] selected by the U.S. Space Force to demonstrate this commitment for the NSSL. Neutron is a powerful new launch option that will set a new standard for performance, affordability, and reliability in medium launch, and its selection to the program demonstrates a high degree of confidence by the Department of Defense in Neutron's capabilities ahead of its first launch later this year. We can't wait to showcase Neutron as the important platform it will become for the Department of Defense," said Rocket Lab Founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck.

Title: The Inconvenient Truth about H-1B Visas
URL: https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-inconvenient-truth-about-h-1b-visas/
Time Published: 2025-03-30T04:01:00Z
Full Content:
Americans are told that mass immigration will bring the world’s geniuses to our country. The numbers tell a different story. President Donald Trump's mandate from the voters undoubtedly gives him wide latitude to close the border to illegal aliens, which he has done. Border crossings are down 90 percent and more illegal aliens were arrested in Trump’s first 50 days than across Joe Biden's final year in office. Now, many in the America First movement are asking, “What about reducing legal immigration?” Big Tech moguls Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy accidentally raised awareness of this controversial topic in December by defending—while also calling for reforms to—the H-1B visa program, which allows companies to hire specialist workers from abroad for up to 6 years. “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B,” Musk noted on X. Ramaswamy said the “badly broken” program “should be replaced with one that focuses on selecting the very best of the best.” Yet he's also blamed American culture for “venerat[ing] mediocrity over excellence,” justifying the foreign worker program. “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” Ramaswamy declared, so “top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over 'native' Americans.” The resulting debates were colorful and worth reading, and they revealed a powerful, widespread desire to reduce America's influx of legal immigrants, and not just among America Firsters. A Rasmussen poll published days after the Musk-Vivek ruckus found that 60 percent of likely voters believe America does not need more H-1B workers since the country “already has enough talented people to train and recruit.” That includes nearly three-quarters of Republicans, two-thirds of swing voters, and almost half of Democrats. At least one California Democrat in Congress has criticized the H-1B system for rampant fraud and abuse. Trump, for his part, denied a larger share of H-1B applications in his first term (18 percent) than either Obama (11 percent) or Biden (just three percent). Yet he recently praised the program, saying he was “a believer in H-1B” who had used it many times in his business properties. That doesn't mean Trump 2.0 won't scale down the program, though. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ruled that visa policies now fall under his purview as “foreign affairs,” allowing him broad discretion to revise visa rules without the drawn-out public notice/comment process. But what are the facts around America's immigration system, and what role do H-1B visas play in it? The H-1B program is capped annually at 85,000 three-year visas, which can be renewed for another three-year term. Estimates put the total number of H-1B workers in the nation at 500,000–600,000 people. At the same time, H-1B holders may apply for lawful permanent residency, allowing them to live and work here indefinitely. The process isn't automatic, but a significant portion—perhaps as high as 90 percent—of H-1B-holders ultimately receive green cards, according to Homeland Security “adjustment of status” statistics. (No one knows the actual figure, apparently.) While the debate that Musk and Ramaswamy kicked off centers on temporary foreign workers, the real debate on the Right should focus on the vastly larger mass-immigration pipeline permitted by our expansive “family reunification” policies. There are roughly 13 million green card holders in the United States, dwarfing the number holding H-1B visas, about half a million. We've admitted more than 1 million more each year since 1990 on average, even during the bleak COVID years of 2020–21. That includes an indeterminate number of H-1B workers. A permanent resident may apply for U.S. citizenship after five years, or three if they marry a U.S. citizen. Between 2021 and 2024, 2.6 million permanent residents became naturalized U.S. citizens, 98 percent of them through the green card process. Once naturalized, however, new citizens may invite in their spouses, married or unmarried children, and even adult siblings—and at 675,000 people per year, the annual immigration cap for family reunification is far larger than any temporary worker program. This is the mass immigration pipeline that a growing number of Trump voters wish to dramatically scale down, if not pause outright and indefinitely as past generations did after periods of intensive migration. We've been in such a period since the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. Since then, the percentage of foreign-born residents has skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of 15.6 percent, or 51 million people, today. The mass immigration that the statute enabled has created serious political consequences for the republic. Naturalized citizens made up a record-breaking 1 in 10 voters in the 2024 election and voted at higher rates than native-born Americans. Forty-four percent self-identified as Democrats, compared with just 30 percent who called themselves Republicans. This has been true for decades, which is why leftist get-out-the-vote groups have spent a fortune courting immigrants as part of the Democratic Party's “New American Majority” program. Astonishingly, this aspect of our troubled immigration system has been largely forgotten, yet it's arguably the part that should concern MAGA voters most, given the movement's interest in putting American jobs, education, health, and well-being first. Perhaps far less attention should be paid to the people immigrating on temporary worker visas and more on this massive immigration pipeline of low-skilled workers under the family reunification policy. That doesn't excuse the glaring problems with the H-1B program, of course. Its proponents—such as Musk and Ramaswamy—often market the H-1B program as our nation's only tool for attracting highly sought-after experts, particularly in the tech industry. But the facts tell a different story. The H-1B program is marketed as importing “highly skilled foreign workers” into the United States. But that's stretching things… a lot. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) lists the requirements to apply: Attainment of a bachelor's degree and a sponsorship by a U.S. employer for a job requiring “highly specialized knowledge.” “Highly specialized knowledge” encompasses everything from a general neurology physician earning $380,000 per year down to an accountant paid $22 an hour, according to job listings on Indeed.com. Most of the positions offered to H-1B applicants are in Big Tech, but many are not. And the “nots” include entry-level mortgage assistants, e-commerce account executives, lathe machinists, bridge repair operators, college admissions consultants, AC/DC motor plant technicians, and life insurance call center specialists—jobs certainly fillable by native-born Americans. Speaking of the native-born, in most cases there is no legal requirement for companies to prioritize hiring Americans before foreigners. Nor are companies prohibited from replacing American employees with (presumably cheaper) H-1B workers, so many do. In 2022 alone, U.S. companies hired 34,000 new H-1B employees while laying off tens of thousands of Americans. Among them was Elon Musk's Tesla, which requested 2,000 new H-1B visas at the same time it was laying off 15,000 U.S. employees last April. The number one H-1B employer is Amazon at 9,265 foreign hires, per the USCIS list of H-1B employers and their total visa employees. Number two is the Indian tech multinational Infosys. This foreign company may be based in Bangalore, yet it's imported over 8,100 H-1B visa workers into the U.S. Infosys has a checkered past: In 2013, the company paid $34 million in a settlement with federal authorities for illegally using B-1 visitor visas for work requiring H-1B visas. Infosys admitted no wrongdoing. In 2019, Infosys reached an $800,000 settlement with California for again funneling nearly 500 employees into the state on B-1 visas, instead of H-1B visas, avoiding paying payroll taxes or disability and unemployment insurance. It's a similar story with the third-biggest H-1B employer: Cognizant Technology Solutions, an Indian tech company that's imported over 6,300 foreign workers into the U.S. In 2024, whistleblowers sued the company for discriminating against 2,000 American workers over imported Indian employees. Not surprisingly, 73 percent of H-1B visa holders come from India and 12 percent from China, countries famous for their ethno-nationalism and highly restrictive immigration systems. Those nations rarely offer citizenship or even permanent residency to foreigners. “I definitely knew it was because of me being an American, not being Indian, and also because I was black,” said one woman who was fired by Cognizant three days after suing the company. A jury agreed with her. While U.S. law clearly protects H-1B workers from discrimination by employers, there's far less scrutiny on employers discriminating against native-born workers in visa holders' favor. Fortunately, the Trump administration has begun cracking down on the practice. But conservatives should ask, “Is it enough?” Other H-1B employers are less shady but their actions will still make conservatives bristle. Hitachi Energy (visas: 45) is a Swiss renewable energy firm that prioritizes “sustainability” and a “commitment to human rights” on the march “towards carbon-neutral” power in line with “the UN's Sustainable Development Goals” on global warming. Similarly, Schlumberger (visas: 97) is a French multinational oil producer “accelerating decarbonization” to “reduce emissions . . . on the journey to net zero.” Again, these are foreign companies outsourcing American jobs to foreign workers… in America. At least these positions are filled by only the best and brightest, bringing much-needed talent to bolster America's economy. But across the country, many more jobs are filled by the luckiest, not the most talented. Every year the H-1B program is flooded with 386,000 applications by individuals who meet its minimum standards. Of these, 65,000 are selected by lottery, while another 20,000 are picked at random from a pool of applicants with master's degrees. Wily companies game the system, using staffing agencies to hire thousands of foreign workers desperate to enter the United States and get a shot at permanent residency and U.S. citizenship, while big companies get lower-cost employees who can't afford to leave. Critics on the right and the left have blasted this system as a revival of indentured servitude. If visa holders lose their job, they have 60 days to find a new position—and a sponsor—or risk overstaying their visa. Consequently, “H-1B workers can't complain too much” about lower wages, writes Peter Van Buren in The American Conservative. “Unable to change jobs freely . . . they have to take what they are given.” Not only experts and analysts, but also everyday people, take issue with the H-1B system. On Reddit, a social media app popular among young people, several users have bluntly criticized the program. An example: H1Bs are a way for firms to force job loyalty through indentured servitude (in spirit) and increase bottom lines by undercutting the acceptable salary range of the already existent American workforce. It's not to fill roles that they can't fill through American labor [due to] lack of availability, that's just the Trojan horse. Then there's socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). “Elon Musk is wrong,“ he tweeted in January. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire “the best and the brightest,” but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.” There are solutions to at least some of these problems. The Trump administration could raise the H-1B salary floor to stop foreign hires from undercutting Americans, prioritize the highest-paid positions to mitigate the lottery's “crowding out” effect, and weight certain industries above others. None of these fixes require shutting down the visa program entirely, but they would go a long way toward addressing its problems. But defenders of the system want to expand the H-1B cap, believing it the best way to discover the world's next Einstein. Yet the U.S. actually has a separate visa specifically for “extraordinary” individuals: the EB-1 “Einstein” visa, which grants permanent residency to 40,000 of the most gifted Olympic athletes, researchers, surgeons, and Pulitzer Prize winners each year. These are unquestionably the “high achievers” most Americans want to attract. Which raises the question, why invite so many middle-class, white-collar jobs through H-1B—particularly at a time of mass tech lay-offs? That's the question bothering so many 20- and 30-something men, a demographic sprinting towards Trump and the new Republican Party in search of hope, opportunity, and dignity. Recent tech industry lay-offs suggest H-1B visas, even if they worked as marketed, aren't needed—or wanted—in the current economy, especially if they lead to layoffs for hard-working Americans. In late February alone, healthcare, cybersecurity, and computer part manufacturers cut 6,000 jobs. Hewlett-Packard announced restructuring plans affecting an additional 6,000 jobs. That's small fry compared with the 380,000 U.S. tech workers laid off between 2022 and 2024, led by Tesla, Intel, and Cisco. Partly this was the result of letting go of extra hands that had been hired during the COVID pandemic to meet ballooning consumer demand, which has since dropped off. Other firms fear a looming recession, so are cutting labor costs to preserve critical cash reserves. Experts expect more lay-offs to come in 2025. A jobs shortage would argue against importing more middle-skill workers. “There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers,” argues the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports H-1B reform. “The H-1B program has transformed over time from a means to supplement the American tech workforce to a means of cheaply replacing it. Americans who are replaced by H-1B guest workers are often forced to train their replacements or risk losing their severance.” At the same time, the center points out, “foreign STEM workers often come from sham universities abroad—particularly in India—and have far fewer specialized skills than they claim.” The center records the stories of 11 different American tech workers unnecessarily replaced by “underqualified” foreign hires. “99 percent of people with H visas are totally underqualified. No skills. I worked with so many of them from Infosys. There are millions of Americans who could do this work,” one Seattle worker writes. “If we said anything, they'd accuse us of being racist, using the company's anti-discrimination policies,” laments another woman laid off from her insurance job. Immigration policy is almost always a numbers game, and a large segment—if not a majority—of the America First movement wants significantly fewer immigrations… or perhaps just few, period. The discussion around H-1B policy both illuminates and obfuscates this. On the one hand, the resentment felt by Americans whose jobs have been outsourced in their very own country suggests the Right wants to go beyond deporting illegal aliens and tighten immigration altogether. On the other hand, too much public discussion is hung up on the relatively modest number of H-1B workers, instead of the million low-skill immigrants who flood in legally each year simply because a family member happens to live here. Sixty percent of green card holders entered either as immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen or through “family-sponsored preferences.” These are decidedly not the world's “best and brightest” doctors, engineers, or AI experts. Chinese and Indians combined comprise just 11 percent of the lawful permanent resident population, whereas Mexicans, Dominicans, Filipinos, and Cubans together make up 36 percent, with Mexicans as the plurality. Nor are they vibrant, young workers with decades in the career force ahead of them: Just 20 percent of green card holders are 34 or younger, while 57 percent are age 35–64. Even without U.S. citizenship, they're entitled to Social Security benefits such as retirement and disability if they worked in the U.S. for at least ten years. This is the consequence not of prioritizing merit, as is often argued, but of the mass immigration system created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. The H-1B fight is really over two different visions of America: Is it a special economic zone without borders or a concrete identity (America the idea), or are we a distinct people with a history, language, culture, and tradition (America the nation)? For MAGA, the answer will make all the difference in the world. Hayden Ludwig is the director of policy research for Restoration of America.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
