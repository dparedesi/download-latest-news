Title: ‘Making the West Great Again’

Time Published: 2025-04-23T10:00:25Z
Full Content:
Last week Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni met with Trump at the White House. They reportedly discussed Ukraine, defense spending, economy, space, energy —specifically Italy importing more US liquefied natural gas— and of course the US tariffs looming over EU imports. One item that really stood out, however, was Meloni’s insight into her brand of nationalism. Here she is speaking during the meeting with the press in the Oval Office: “Someone calls me a Western nationalist , I don’t know if that’s the right word, but I know that when I talk about the West, I’m not talking primarily about geographical space , but about civilization.” She added: “The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together, and we will keep on working on that.” On its face, it is contradictory. Either one is nationalistic or it subscribes to the western order headquartered in Washington. Yet, Meloni has been at the lead of squaring this circle in Europe over the past few years. As the 2023 elections in Italy approached with Meloni leading the polls, international media was in an uproar over the return of fascism to Rome. It was commonly assumed that she would lead a short-lived government that sparred with the EU and NATO. That belief was reasonably based on Meloni’s past statements critical of the supranational organizations, as well as the worn path from other political insurgencies of both the left and the right. And yet Meloni is still here, now among the five most durable of the Republic: And the party she leads maintains a steadily comfortable cushion in Italian polls. Part of that rests on feckless, Obama-inspired Partitico Democratico and the other is an increasingly disenchanted electorate. But it’s also reflective of Meloni’s realization that real nationalism wouldn’t play in Washington and Brussels and that she was destined to lose any struggle with NATO and the EU. She has instead sought to lead the European flank of “Western nationalism.” Others might call it “civilizational Europe.” To Quinn Slobodian, Meloni would be yet another “bastard of neoliberalism.” While her Brothers of Italy party struggles to crack 30 percent at home, she has become an international darling. Following the New York Times —the US paper of record— announcement at the beginning of 2024 that Meloni “solidifie[d] her credentials” and “put the European establishment at ease” the media has lauded her. She has been bestowed with the coveted title of Europe’s “Trump whisperer.” She was also well-received by the Biden administration and is chummy with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Even the Atlantic Council, the liberal internationalist establishment’s think tank, crowned her with its “Global Citizen” award last year. Meloni’s Western nationalism is the reason she is embraced so enthusiastically. What are the tenets of that philosophy? Let’s take a look. Neoliberalism Meloni and others on the “new right” like Argentine President Javier Milei and Trump himself like to tout themselves as rebels against the grating virtue signalling of the Davos cabal. They might be in style, but in substance they are a continuation. If neoliberalism is markets before people, Meloni and others on the “new” usually say they are for the people, nationalism — in Melon’s case, Western nationalism. Yet they have virtually zero plans to elevate the people over finance and tech—and in many cases seek to further empower the latter. Meloni has made much of her desire for more Italian babies and a strengthening of the family, but her economic policies do the opposite. Indeed, Italian youth continue to emigrate en masse due to the lack of decent paying jobs at home. The Meloni government has been overseeing a wave of privatizations, including critical communications infrastructure to CIA-connected private equity, and plans for more of the state rail company Ferrovie dello Stato, Poste Italiane, Monte dei Paschi bank and energy giant Eni. The firesale is necessitated by more tax cuts for the wealthy, as well as more than billions of euros Rome has burned through in order to address the loss of pipeline gas from Russia, which includes buying more US LNG. In 2023, Meloni chose May Day to announce her government’s promotion of short-term worker contracts, as well as the abolition of Italy’s basic income program, which provided the unemployed with an average of 567 euros a month. Despite the program providing a mild stimulus to the economy, Meloni said its elimination will force people back to work. “Where is the slump in the economy and employment?” she asked. She failed to mention that roughly 40 percent of Italian workers earn less than 10 euros an hour in the country where real wages have done this: Italy’s real wage misery: inflation-adjusted wages in 2023 were 4.4% lower than in 1990. Even real wages in Greek performed a little better. pic.twitter.com/rRN9QE4JE7 — Philipp Heimberger (@heimbergecon) July 3, 2024 So what of Meloni’s stated desire to “make the West great again”? It appears the tools to accomplish the job are the same that have been used for the three-plus decades. The cure for Italy’s ills is always more wage suppression, more market-friendly reforms, more social spending cuts, and more privatization. The country has actually followed the EU’s neoliberal reform policy rulebook much more closely than Berlin or Paris, and the answer when it inevitably doesn’t work, is always to double down. Meloni has done nothing to change this, and has embraced a future in which Italy is a deindustrialized imperial military outpost that doubles as a sunny Mediterranean corporate resort owned by (mostly) American capital. Immigration that Serves Capital Meloni is anti-immigrant except for those who are valuable for capital. In that case, they are welcome in the garden as a serf. It’s remarkably similar to the Trump-Silicon Valley vision for the US, even down to the use of foreign prisons. Meloni who rode to power two years ago based in part on strong opposition to illegal immigration and asylum. She quickly backed down on her deportations pledge, however, and ended up increasing the supply of cheap foreign labor at the request of Italian capital. She’s made a big show of it all, however, and now has a nearly $1 billion detention facility in Albania sitting empty after courts blocked the plan. They’re now being rebranded as repatriation hubs, in line with a recent EU proposal, which largely embraces Meloni’s vision. What the Albanian detention centers do is offshore the detention of immigrants and refugees outside of EU law while still allowing in those deemed valuable for capital. Meloni, after all, says she wants immigrants that contribute to the economy. ​​Meloni, despite railing against immigrants, is increasing the number of work permits to non-EU nationals in an effort to boost the supply of cheap labor. While Italians try to scrape by on low salaries, foreign workers can be paid even less. According to the 2020 IDOS Statistical Dossier on Immigration, the overall average monthly wage for foreign workers was 1,077 euros in 2019, which was 23.5 percent lower than that of Italians’ 1,408 euros. That gap is only widening in Italy, as well as the EU. In the agricultural sector in particular, migrant workers are subject to various forms of abuse and live and work in inhumane conditions. That is, of course, precisely why Italian oligarchs demanded a certain flow of immigrants. Italian big business welcomed the increase, but immediately said more will be needed to tackle a longstanding demographic decline. So Italians leave searching for higher wages and immigrants come in to fill low-wage jobs. Nationalism it ain’t – unless one conceives of the “western nation” as solely a profit extracting mechanism for oligarchs. When Meloni embraces the “Western nationalist” label and explains she’s talking about civilization, that’s the civilization she’s referring to. Atlanticism In Meloni’s speech last year accepting the Atlantic Council’s Global Citizen award, one of the items she chose not to talk about was “the efforts the Italian government is doing to reform its country to make it, once again, a protagonist of the geopolitical chessboard.” By that she means American hegemony with Italy—and Europe— acting as the US sidekick. It’s difficult to know what reforms exactly she’s talking about, but we can make some educated guesses. A few hours ahead of Meloni’s meeting with Trump, her finance minister announced Italy would hit 2 percent of GDP on defense spending this year—up from 1.5 percent. There has been speculation that Rome would try some creative accounting by throwing expenditures like the Coast Guard into the defense category, but that looks to have been abandoned in favor of buying more American products. Of course, this will mean more of a budget squeeze, which only reinforces the argument that Italy must privatize state assets. New York-based private equity behemoth KKR, which includes former CIA director David Petraeus as a partner, snatched up the fixed-line network of Telecom Italia last year. Rome approved of BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, taking a stake of more than 3 percent in defense and aerospace group Leonardo, which makes it the second largest shareholder after the state. Meloni is getting pushback on the major SpaceX deal she has championed. That potential deal would see Musk’s company provide security and encryption service to the Italian public sector. Meloni has also taken on a decidedly anti-China edge as well, withdrawing from Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative at the end of 2023. Add it all up, and Meloni simply represents different flavor of vassalage than elsewhere in Europe. While an adherent to the liberal rules-based order champions LGBTQ and immigration, the western nationalist opts for family values and rails against immigration. But the economic policies remain largely the same. It’s difficult to see a ton of daylight, for example, between Meloni and the Green madwoman in Berlin, Annalena Baerbock. She spent recent years openly arguing that Germany’s place was as overseer of America’s imperial order in Europe and junior partner in other global conflicts. Baerbock sold this as a “feminist” foreign policy; for Meloni it’s a civilizational struggle. Both are euphemisms for imperialism. We see where that got Germany, although it is a mindset that remains despite the replacement of Scholz and Baerbock with new faces. Italy, too, has also been hammered by the New Cold War and the EU’s severing itself from Russian pipeline gas, which has only added to the economic decay the country has been mired in since joining the common currency in the 1990s. Meloni and her “western nationalism” being welcome in the European halls of power alongside those still clinging to their respectable liberal rules-based order, is likely to only accelerate these trends as the very mixture of Meloni’s style of nationalism and neoliberalism mean that she and the country she currently leads will be sold up the river to further the goals of Western capital. Openly offering Italy up as a “protagonist” piece to be used by the US on the geopolitical chessboard should be setting off alarm bells in Italy. A look at the history of such protagonist American allies would show that Meloni and Italy are soon going to get burned—even if she’s currently the “Trump whisperer.” The Atlantic Council’s “Global Citizen Award”…a bureaucrat who cares only about 1/8th of the globe…one couldnt make this up… Nope. They care only about 1% of the 1/8th of the globe. the Golden Ten Million. I have no statistics but I would guess in Germany agriculture without foreign (mostly undocumented) labour would break down. Same for meat-processing industry. The truly blue-collar work is not even done by natives when they´re poor. And while sociology and left think tanks used to have models on how to organize labour in a democratic society in a meaningful and just way I have the impression the insight and demands to transform those into genuine policies by unions and left parties thereof has been totally abandoned. Thanks for this great piece. I guess I´m gonna pester my Italian friends with it… p.s. We did have discussions over German native Eike Schmidt who had been the director of the Uffizi in Florence until last year. He then planned to run as Florence mayor supported by right-wing parties. (I believe there was even discussion over Schmidt as cultural minister under Meloni.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eike_Schmidt When Meloni won everyone demanded that Schmidt ought to deny any cooperation with her being a “fascist”. I of course doubted that approach. We came to no conclusion. I know too little of the minutes of the preceding 10 years in Italian politics to be able to judge if there were major differences between Meloni and here social democratic predecessors to “justify” such a move to oppose as cultural manager beyond self-serving. When does activism serve the people, when does it not? Schmidt lost. His opponent, Sara Funaro had a Jewish father. So, of course, The Times of Israel gets involved. But she also has not placed Judaism or Israel at the center of her career, instead trying to respond to hate against her with a poker face and framing her public persona around her family’s deep roots in the Tuscan city.> Sounds like she’s dealing with antisemitism, instead of responding to her German opponent, with no “deep roots” in Florence. On Israel “Florence has always been a city of peace and dialogue and does not tolerate divisive messages that incite hatred,” she said at the time. “Always”? Dante might have had a different opinion. For the future “Serving as the mayor of Florence opens up many opportunities,” said Pini. “All Florence mayors went on doing something at the national or international level. Renzi? Thank you, Conor. Just a bit off topic from Blighty: Last December, to commemorate Labour’s first six months in power (or should that be in office, but not in power), the Financial Times, including a friend on the City team, interviewed some of the back room staff and included some settling of scores. Not all of the material was published as the FT would like to keep lines of communication open. Two things struck, alarmed even, my friend as they are married to the child of immigrants and would like to start a family. Mandelson’s protege and the brains behind Starmer, Cork born and raised and Fine Gael stalwart Morgan McSweeney, said Labour would not be outflanked from the right and looked forward to and even relished fighting (Farage’s) Reform on their turf, Labour thinks the latter part of this decade and next will be dominated by Vance, Weidel (that was before the German federal elections), Le Pen (that was before the court case) and Meloni, so Starmer wants and needs to be on (their) side, Labour thinks the left and even centre have nowhere to go, and (the bit which alarmed my friend) would scapegoat immigrants and other minorities. I think Italy may get burned, but Meloni won’t be. For example, former Finnish PM Sanne Marin is employed by Blair and lives in style in London. The likes of Baerbock, Kallas, von der Leyen (descendant of English gentry) and Sandu can look forward to that retirement from front line politics. The sons of Radek Sikorski and Anne Apfelbaum went to Eton and Oxford and divide their time between London, the Cotswolds and NYC. This is the lifestyle that the US elite can offer them, so why not betray one’s country. “… While an adherent to the liberal rules-based order champions LGBTQ and immigration, the western nationalist opts for family values and rails against immigration. But the economic policies remain largely the same. It’s difficult to see a ton of daylight, for example, between Meloni and the Green madwoman in Berlin, Annalena Baerbock. She spent recent years openly arguing that Germany’s place was as overseer of America’s imperial order in Europe and junior partner in other global conflicts. Baerbock sold this as a “feminist” foreign policy; for Meloni it’s a civilizational struggle. Both are euphemisms for imperialism.” Yes. This is the key point everywhere in the West as far as I can tell. These increasingly “polarized” political camps are mainly sheep-herding mechanisms for different segments of the “electorate,” while the trajectories of both foreign and domestic policy continue on steadily through the administrations of “Democrats” or “Republicans,” “Socialists” or “Conservatives,” the “Left” or the “Right,” etc. As Conor emphasizes here and has noted before, there is a “compatible right” just as there is a “compatible left” in the West. The political rhetoric differs; the policies remain the same. Wowsers. That graphic. Berlusconi, Craxi, Renzi, Meloni. Every one of them successful postmodern politicians — purveyors of the big nothing. One might argue, though, that Meloni is the most intelligent and the least corrupt. Berlusconi represented (and his Forza Italia still represents) the big bourgeoisie of Lombardy and the Veneto. Craxi is the politician who makes Italians shake their heads: “Bettino should have known better.” Renzi is the Hillary Clinton of Italy, although slightly more charming: He’s office politics, self-promotion, and grift, grift, grift. The most important part of this excellent article is that Italian politics isn’t all that hard to understand. The Anglosphere likes to go on about an enigma wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a mozzarella, but there is no mystery of how Italian politics works, how the parties align, and how Italian politicians have damaged the social state to comply with directives from the EU. To wit: “She failed to mention that roughly 40 percent of Italian workers earn less than 10 euros an hour in the country where real wages have … [declined over the course of the past thirty years].” Frankly, I am appalled by how little Italians make. Further, because minimum wage is decided by negotiations by economic sector and not by a national law, the concept of a minimum wage is rickety. Fortunately, workplace protections are still stronger in Italy than in “at-will employee” U S of A. I will be watching the results of the referendums to be held on 8 / 9 June to repeal the so-called Jobs Act and to change citizenship requirements to be less reliant on jus sanguinis (inherited citizenship). Further, the argument that the Western industrial countries aren’t competitive on wages doesn’t hold up when one looks at how low Italian wages are. Instead, it’s the war on the working class. Heck, even Italian medical doctors don’t make what a U.S. medical doctor makes. As to “Western nationalism,” which must come out of the Frodo-Atreju-Gollum-Tolkien wing of the Fratelli d’Italia, I am reminded of Meloni’s insistence on the use of the word Nazione for Italy. Italy is many things, but it is too varied a country to be a nazione. For most Italians, it is Il Paese. The country. Nation is a top-down idea, a fantasy of hierarchy. Here in the Undisclosed Region, mon petit pays, society is from the ground up — a country of cows, bees, chocolate, educution, an amazing work ethic, and religion in the style of Pope Francis. Nation, indeed. Thank you, DJG. I have noticed the Italians moving to Mauritius. They tend to work in textiles, hotels and catering, but some are in finance and technology. There are a dozen families, split evenly between young and retirees, in my small town on the west coast. We have had Italian neighbours, two different families, for a dozen years. With regard to Renzi, he’s the darling of British centrists. They know nothing about him apart from the marketing by the MSM. From your comments, it seems that many people from Europe are moving to Mauritius. Any push-back from the local population against that form of immigration? And how much total population can Mauritius comfortably host? Thank you. There’s very little evidence of push back other than for environmental reasons, insufficient water / water infrastructure and loss of farm land, and, but not solely due to much better paid foreigners, house prices going up. Many, if not most, Mauritians have family and friends abroad, so they are relaxed. Also, there are no indigenous Mauritians. Migrants are quite safe and most welcome there. There aren’t enough Mauritians, especially with skills. DJG, What are your thoughts about the impact on Italy of Hillary Clinton? She is linked to the downfall of Muammar Khadaffi. His efforts held back the wave of immigration through Lampedusa. I wouldn’t worry too much about the announcements of Meloni. She is kinda like the AOC of the EU. She too was elected on the basis of being a reformer and once in she ran up the Jolly Roger and showed her true colours. That threat that Ursula made against her before her election about the EU having the tools to use to bring her in line was totally unnecessary. With Biden in she trimmed Italy’s sails to what he wanted as much as she could and even rescued him when he stared to wander away from that group of EU leaders. But then the winds of change came along with the election of Donald Trump and she jumped a plane to meet with him for several hours in Mar-a-Lago back in January. And that is the key with her. She will always align herself with the most powerful figure at any particular time in order to ensure her own political survival. If Putin was made head of the EU tomorrow I’m sure that she would jump the next plane to Moscow to talk to him about Italy’s historical ties to Russia. Thank you, Rev. Having worked in Russia for HSBC twenty years ago, I noticed how much of the equipment for factories and parts for vehicles came from Italy. Italy was then and is to some extent now a serious competitor for Germany, but China is eclipsing the pair. The problem for the Western mindset in general, is that it is very node oriented, from atoms to individuals, in a reality that is the interplay between nodes and networks. The essence of the node is synchronization, everything on the same wavelength, functioning as one. While the essence of the network is harmonization. Everything interacting, with an overall balance. “Entangled particles.” So when it’s just the node, it becomes a feedback loop with no circuit breakers. Microphone up to the speaker, shriek going parabolic. Echo chamber. Like Israel. The eventual consequence is when it all goes super nova and collapses into the vortex in the middle. Black hole. If they ditched the euphemisms and just explained what they believe about the way the world works, they’d sound more coherent. Imagine Meloni pledging her allegiance to the Empire, waxing rhapsodic about her imperial patriotism, and exclaiming how true and just it is that the lesser orders don’t get a say in how it’s run. It might take less energy than the constant stream of P.R. talk, which I know politicians enjoy, somewhat sadistically. Is it just me or is this basically another slight variant of Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” with somewhat different costuming? And wasn’t even that basically a way to make xenophobia intellectually respectable again? So Italians leave searching for higher wages and immigrants come in to fill low-wage jobs. This is what happened in the great Roman Empire. Brave Roman citizens left Rome to expand abroad, and vice versa, the conquered people went to Rome, the economic center of the city. I think Meloni is more of a traditionalist than Mussolini. The chart by Philipp Heimberger is a devastating indictment of Italy’s economic (mis-)management over the past 30 years. Even worse than Greece. 1987’s Il Sorpasso is just a distant memory. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_sorpasso_(economics) Thank you and well said. I have followed Heimberger’s work for years. Some years ago, he was invited to meetings in Rome and Brussels to discuss his analysis. Unfortunately, the neoliberal Italian government, which set up the meetings, did not support his findings. Young Italians are still coming to the UK. One hears from them of their peers in Germany and Netherlands. It’s so sad that Italy,which once had a strong communist/leftist movement, now only has these pathetic centrist parties. This, no one to challenge Meloni. I thought 5 states movement might make an impact, but did not happen. They gave up their sovereignty when they joined the euro. Your email address will not be published.

Title: ESG, Reincarnated

The new shape of climate-conscious investing. Can we invest our way out of the climate crisis? That’s the question we started this series with, and in this episode, we try to answer that question. So far, we’ve been talking about the trillions of dollars of investor capital that could fund climate solutions or keep fueling the crisis. But what about our own money? What can we as individuals do to protect our savings from climate risk and not contribute to the problem? One place where you might have more power than you think is in your retirement savings. By taking a closer look at how you invest that money, you could potentially reduce your carbon impact more than going vegan, putting solar on your roof or buying an electric car. And while environmental, social and governance investing might be dead — or deeply wounded — some governments aren’t backing off climate-conscious investing. New York City has developed an aggressive investing strategy to accelerate its energy transition; it’s invested billions of dollars in climate solutions, and it’s divesting from some fossil fuel companies. In this episode, we look at the future of climate-conscious investing. Host Amy Scott pops the hood of her own retirement investments and shows you how you can too. We also visit a battery storage farm in the Bronx to see how New York City is leveraging its shareholder power to fund climate solutions. Finally, we look at a phenomenon that has emerged in the wake of the ESG backlash — something called “greenhushing.” Note: Marketplace podcasts are meant to be heard, with emphasis, tone and audio elements a transcript can’t capture. Transcripts are generated using a combination of automated software and human transcribers, and may contain errors. Please check the corresponding audio before quoting it. Amy Scott: If I'm an investor, you know, worried about the climate crisis, what kind of impact do my retirement savings have? Alex Wright-Gladstein: It turns out that moving your investments to a climate friendly investment option is the single most impactful thing that the average American can do for climate change. Amy Scott: We've been talking so far this season about other people's money, the trillions of dollars of investor capital that can fund climate solutions or keep fueling the crisis. But what about you and me? What can we as individuals do to protect our savings from climate risk and not contribute to the problem? To find out, I called up Alex Wright-Gladstein. She's the founder and CEO of Sphere, a company focused on climate friendly investing, and Alex says there's a lot of invisible power in our retirement portfolios. Alex Wright-Gladstein: It turns out it's more impactful than the combination of going vegan, never flying again, driving an electric car, putting solar on your house. Amy Scott: Sphere has a tool online where you can look up the carbon impact of your workplace retirement plan. I type in Marketplace's parent company. Ooh, $19 million. This is how much American Public Media Group employees have invested in fossil fuel companies through their retirement savings plan. And scroll through the report, which is based on tax filings from 2021. On average, about $15,700 per employee, and then it compares us to some other companies. So Walmart is similar. Apple is actually lower, 8.1%, but of course, as that's a percentage, the actual money would be significantly more. If my employer divested from fossil fuels, the website tells me, it would be like taking 7800 cars off the road each year. Anyone listening in HR? So that's my workplace as a whole. For a more granular look, Alex points me to another website called fossilfreefunds.org, where I can enter the ticker symbols for the individual funds I'm invested in. All right, so... And that's when things get a bit grimmer. Fidelity international index. I'm going to look up that. Ooh, it gets an F. Alex Wright-Gladstein: Yeah. Amy Scott: Oh shoot. Fossil fuel exposure of 10.33% places the fund in the F tier. Oof, okay. Alex Wright-Gladstein: It's invested in companies including Shell and Total and BP, etc. Amy Scott: Alex tries to reassure me. Alex Wright-Gladstein: I will say that's pretty standard for any international index fund. Amy Scott: Okay… I poke around a bit more, try out a few more index funds that I have. It doesn't get much better. A D is as good as it gets. Ouch. Alex says, lately, more people are looking for greener alternatives. Alex Wright-Gladstein: Especially since the most recent election, I think people realized they can't rely on the government to save us when it comes to climate change, and so they've been turning to what they can do. Amy Scott: That raises a really important question, which is kind of the question that is overarching our series, can we invest our way out of the climate crisis? Alex Wright-Gladstein: I believe the answer is yes. I really do believe that this is the most impactful thing that we can do to turn around climate change, and we absolutely can invest our way out of the crisis. Amy Scott: I'm Amy Scott. This is How We Survive. Last episode, we looked back at the origins of the ESG backlash. In this episode, we look forward to the future of climate-conscious investing, how we as individuals can make a difference with our own retirement savings, and how the country's largest city is using its shareholder power to accelerate the energy transition. While that acronym ESG might be dead or deeply wounded, the principles behind it live on. This is episode three, reincarnation. Before she started Sphere, Alex Wright-Gladstein was running a clean tech company and wanted to offer her employees a climate-friendly option in their retirement plan. But she had a hard time finding any. Alex Wright-Gladstein: And when I finally got offered some options by our 401K advisors, they were offering ESG options. And I had never heard the term ESG before. I didn't know what it meant, but I looked up the funds, and I saw that they were invested in fossil fuel companies. And I was like, Okay, I don't know what ESG means, but I don't think it means climate friendly. Amy Scott: Remember, the climate part of ESG is concerned with climate risk, how companies are preparing for the risks the climate crisis might pose, not necessarily how good they are for the environment. So Alex decided to create her own index fund, the Sphere 500 Climate Fund. Alex Wright-Gladstein: The key thing we do is exclude fossil fuel companies. Amy Scott: The Sphere 500 is made up of the top 500 companies in the US by market value, minus fossil fuel companies. It also excludes some other businesses, like tobacco, private prisons, and weapons manufacturers. Alex says Sphere also votes its shares in favor of climate friendly proposals, which she says is rare for traditional fund managers. Alex Wright-Gladstein: Most people don't think about this, but we're having our shares voted on our behalf by fund managers who are voting against climate related shareholder proposals 98% of the time. Amy Scott: Alex says none of this means investors lose out on returns. The Sphere 500 has low fees, similar to any S&P 500 index fund, and it performs about as well. Alex Wright-Gladstein: It's really brilliant how really it's the fossil fuel industry and the fossil fuel lobby has framed this as, Well, you gotta choose between investing with your progressive values or investing for good returns, when data actually shows that you don't have to choose. You can do both. Amy Scott: Today, Sphere's fund is available in more than 200 401K plans, but not to public retirees in Texas. Remember the blacklist we talked about last episode? Sphere's fund is on that list, meaning Texas pension funds can't invest in it. Alex says Sphere protested the decision. Alex Wright-Gladstein: We said, Yes, we care about climate change, but look, here are all the financial reasons that we're excluding fossil fuels. We showed how they've been the worst performers of the economy over the past 10, 15, 20 years. We showed how volatile the industry is, and how if you want to avoid that volatility, it can make sense to exclude them. Amy Scott: But it stayed on the blacklist. Now the company is part of a lawsuit challenging the state's anti-ESG law on constitutional grounds. But while Texas and a growing number of states have sought to outlaw climate-conscious investing, other governments are taking the opposite approach, like New York City. How did someone manage to get graffiti on that building? That's amazing. Brad Lander: That is impressive. Amy Scott: From a high rise in Manhattan's financial district, I'm taking in the view of the New York Harbor with Brad Lander, controller of New York City. Brad Lander: We are in Seven World Trade Center overlooking Brooklyn and Queens and Long Island and lower Manhattan. It's a gorgeous view this morning. Amy Scott: As the city's chief financial officer, he monitors the health of its finances and its public pension funds, money belonging to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers living in the boroughs surrounding us. Brad Lander: You can see what a harbor city it is. You know, it's hard not to come up here and think about what Superstorm Sandy did and how long we have to go to be ready. Amy Scott: In 2012, New York City was caught by surprise when Superstorm Sandy walloped the East Coast. It caused massive flooding in the city and an estimated $19 billion in damage. 52 people died. Brad Lander: Everyone was impacted. Of course, people in communities that were were flooded and displaced were most directly impacted. The subways were out for a few days, and the power was out and you couldn't get gasoline into the gas terminal so you couldn't buy gas in the gas stations. Amy Scott: It was a long road to recovery, and Controller Lander says it was a wake up call. Brad Lander: So it really did spark something in the city. Amy Scott: So in the aftermath of the storm, New York decided to take action. The state and the city are now working on slashing emissions and making buildings more efficient, and taking a hard look at their investments. Brad Lander: If we don't collectively achieve decarbonization goals, it's not only going to cost lives like it did in Superstorm Sandy, it's going to cost trillions of dollars, and we'll feel the impact of that in our funds. Amy Scott: There's the physical risk to investments from extreme weather and sea level rise, but also, so called transition risk, from the shift to a low carbon economy. You don't want a portfolio full of fossil fuel stocks when everyone's driving an EV. Brad Lander: So we've adopted one of the most ambitious Net Zero implementation plans, one of the boldest climate transition investing strategies of any US public pension fund. Amy Scott: That strategy involves divesting from some fossil fuel companies and engaging other companies, like utilities, to pressure them to reduce emissions. Not everyone is happy with that approach. A few years ago, some employees filed a lawsuit accusing the city's pension plans of a breach of fiduciary duty for divesting from fossil fuels. Brad Lander: But the judge dismissed the case because their pensions are being paid, our returns are good, and the judge concluded that they lack standing. Amy Scott: In fact, he says last year, returns were 10%, beating most of the system's public sector peers. The city is also investing its pension funds in climate solutions. Brad Lander: We increased our clean energy and climate transition investments now to over $11 billion in some amazing companies. Amy Scott: One of those companies is Nine Dot Energy. Yeah, we made it. Adam Cohen: Our little corner of the northeast Bronx. Amy Scott: Pretty cool. I've never been up here. In a fenced in gravel lot sandwiched between an elementary school and a big shopping center, I meet up with co-founder, Adam Cohen. All right, you want to show us around? Adam Cohen: Sure. Amy Scott: With his navy hoodie, he looks the part of a young entrepreneur. Adam Cohen: We can walk this way. Amy Scott: We walk down a row of big gray cabinets. Adam Cohen: So these are batteries. These are big batteries. Amy Scott: Can you unlock one of those cages for us or no? Adam Cohen: No. Amy Scott: What would happen? Voice 1: A really painful death. No, I'm just kidding. Adam Cohen: No, nothing. Nothing would happen. Amy Scott: These cabinets hold a combined three megawatts of battery storage. Nine Dot estimates that's enough to power about 3000 New York City households for four hours on a hot summer day. The batteries sit here all charged up with energy from the power lines overhead. Adam Cohen: And then hold that power until the utility says, Please give it back. Amy Scott: When the grid for the city gets stressed, maybe it's an especially hot summer day and everyone's running their AC, the city utility, Con Ed, can call on Nine Dot to help relieve that stress. Adam Cohen: So last summer, it was called half a dozen times, so in the peak of the peak days. Amy Scott: Enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a combined 24 metric tons. That's the equivalent of 9000 car trips on the Cross Bronx Expressway. Nine Dot's hope is that more of these battery storage farms can be built all over the city, reducing the reliance on dirty power plants and eventually helping the grid transition to renewable sources. Adam Cohen: The sun only shines when nature tells it to, the wind only blows when nature tells it to, but people use electricity when they decide to, and so a battery helps mediate that process. It pulls in the extra power when it's available and then we put it back out when people call for it. Amy Scott: Nine Dot is still in growth mode, but Brad Lander and the city of New York hope the investment pays off, not just for retirees, but for future generations, like the kids at the school right across the street from the battery farm. Virtue Onoja: I'm definitely an artist. One thing about me, I'm definitely an artist. Amy Scott: Virtue Onoja is a sixth grader who attended the Bronx Charter School for Better Learning II. Two years ago, Nine Dot invited students to paint a mural along the outside of the fence with a local artist. Virtue Onoja: Down over here, I did like most stuff over here. I drew like most of the park and the trees. Amy Scott: Walking me up and down the fence, Virtue points out some of her drawings. Virtue Onoja: I drew a clear blue sky, no pollution, no nothing. Beautiful flowers, beautiful yellow flowers and the sun. Amy Scott: There are also drawings of windmills and electric school buses. It's a hopeful imagining of the future that the city is trying to invest into reality. But while New York is loudly and proudly pushing ahead, another phenomenon has emerged in the wake of the ESG backlash. Bruce Usher: I expect the next four years are going to be a period of what we call green hushing. Amy Scott: Coming up after the break. [BREAK] Amy Scott: Just a few weeks ago reading the news, I noticed Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, was out with his latest open letter. It's a wide ranging essay touching on the democratization of investing, infrastructure and the retirement savings crisis. In 27 pages, no mentions of ESG, no surprise, or climate change. There was one mention of decarbonization in reference to China. Instead, he argued for energy pragmatism. That's something he talked about recently as keynote speaker at one of the largest oil and gas conferences in the world. Larry Fink: I think across the board, we have to think about power and energy in a pragmatic way. When the whole conversation, including some of my CEO letters, back a few years back when we talked about that we're going to have to focus on decarbonization. I still believe that, but I also caution that any decarbonizing technology right now is highly inflationary. Amy Scott: As in, too expensive. Larry Fink: We have to be working side by side in trying to find ways of reducing the costs of wind and solar and other energy sources. But let's be clear, we're going to be dependent on dispatchable power for a long, long time. Amy Scott: Dispatchable power meaning sources that can be turned on or off and still rely heavily on fossil fuels. Gone is the urgency from Fink's previous letters. And to be fair, the global situation has changed. Russia's invasion of Ukraine increased demand for US natural gas. The explosion of AI requires more and more energy, and the United States has elected a pro-fossil fuel president who is hostile to the energy transition and actively trying to stop it. All of these factors, along with the ESG backlash, have led investors to push climate risk off the main stage and into the wings. Bruce Usher: I expect the next four years are going to be a period of what we call green hushing. Amy Scott: This is Bruce Usher at the Columbia Business School. We heard from him in the first episode about the origins of ESG. You've heard of greenwashing, where companies make misleading claims about how eco-friendly they are. Bruce says, with green hushing... Bruce Usher: Businesses are not talking about what they're doing on climate change for political reasons, or they just feel there's not that, you know, it's not advantageous for them to talk about it. But in fact, the business activity may not change that much. If renewable energy is profitable, people will keep doing renewable energy. If, if selling electric vehicles is successful, they'll keep selling electric vehicles. Amy Scott: So while BlackRock may not talk so much about ESG, Bruce says phrases like transition finance have taken its place. Bruce Usher: Transition finance is financing the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energies. It's very similar investing. The point is that companies are going to change what they say, based on the political temperature, but at the end of the day, if there's a profitable business in these industries, they will continue to invest in them. Amy Scott: I asked Jason Isaac about this. Remember from last episode, he was the architect of the original anti-ESG law in Texas. Amy Scott: So have you heard the term green hushing? Jason Isaac: I wasn't using that term green hushing, but I may have to add that to my vocabulary. Amy Scott: Jason agrees, even after the Texas law passed, he's not convinced financial firms have changed their ways. Jason Isaac: These financial institutions are essentially now kind of like reverse virtue signaling. They're virtue signaling to Republican or red states that, oh, we're getting out of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. We're getting out of the Net Zero Banking Alliance. But in their statements, they're saying we're going to continue the policies that align with the energy transition. We're going to continue to work towards net zero and decarbonization in alignment with the Paris Accords. Amy Scott: Meanwhile, ESG is still popular in Europe and Canada and other parts of the world, but there's no question Jason's and others' efforts have had a chilling effect. In the past two years, investors have pulled more money out of US ESG funds than they've put in, according to Morningstar. So many firms have withdrawn from the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative it suspended activities. And Brad Lander, New York City controller, says that matters. Brad Lander: It is deeply disappointing the ways that asset managers in general including BlackRock and large financial institutions have walked back from what they know is wise fiduciary investing. This is an urgent crisis. If we had 100 years for the energy transition that we have to make, it might be a different story. But no, if you know climate risk is financial risk, and you believe it's your fiduciary duty to invest in ways that are attentive to risk, you've got to have the courage to stand up and say so. Amy Scott: We started this season with a question, was I naive to think Wall Street might actually save us from the climate crisis? And the answer is, yeah, a little bit. But the reality is also more complicated than I realized. These are crucial years to be slow pedaling climate action, the damage is very real. But as inaction becomes more and more costly, investors seeking profits and ways to manage their risks from climate change, will continue to fund solutions, whatever their motivations. Like it or not, nothing motivates people like money. Thanks for listening.

Title: Rural Trump Voters Won’t Regret Their Vote Until Democrats Fight for Them

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Trump promised to address the opioid epidemic and restore small towns to health and prosperity. The president has betrayed those who placed their trust in him. The damage done just in the Trump administration’s first three months could fill the National Archives—assuming that department still exists. Many of those moves, including the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a Salvadoran gulag, have been cruel and utterly unjust. Yet public support for Trump, though declining, remains stubbornly high among rural and working-class people. Some part of that support comes from his ability to couch everything he does as retaliation against liberal elites and a blow against the “rigged system” those elites helped create—a system that has undermined the values and livelihoods of ordinary working people. What will it take to stop Trump? It’s hard to predict how many of the people who supported Trump will turn against him because of the deportation of Garcia, student activists, and others. Those fights absolutely must continue and, we hope, will awaken more and more Americans to the dismantling of democracy. But there will always be those who are moved more by negative impacts to their daily lives. Job loss, hospital and school closures, a huge spike in the cost of essential goods—these are perennial deal-breakers that outlive the daily news cycle. As we suggested in our February column, reacting negatively to every radical idea Trump tosses out only solidifies the left’s position as defenders of the establishment—the very system tens of millions of Americans blame for their woes. We also believe that protesting the bad stuff only gets us so far, and that a positive vision for bettering the lives of rural and working people must be front and center. That said, when it does come to complaining loudly about the impact of Trump’s chaotic nihilism, we should focus on actions that have hurt large numbers of people, many of whom voted for Trump. We need to empathize with and acknowledge their struggles and help channel it into buyers’ remorse: “Trump has betrayed us” gets to the heart of the matter, whereas “Hands off!” smacks of a desire to restore the status quo. To stop Trump and reverse the assault on our economy and democracy, we need to redeploy some of our outrage to highlight how Trump’s actions are actually making the rigged system worse for the folks who put him in office: farmers, small businesses, coal miners, factory and blue-collar workers, consumers struggling with high prices and debt. Until our protest routinely includes the betrayal of folks like these, we have almost no chance of building the broad resistance coalition needed to reverse the disastrous course we’re on. With that in mind, we offer a few examples of Trump’s betrayals of rural and working-class people that we urge the left to prioritize, while also highlighting policies that will reverse those betrayals. Farmers, a core constituency for Trump, have been among the worst hit by his actions since taking office. For midsize and larger farmers, tariffs have prompted widespread anxiety that they are being squeezed from both ends: They’re facing higher costs on inputs like Canadian potash and steel for agricultural equipment, combined with a potentially dramatic loss of markets for soybeans, pork, and other commodities. On top of that, the dismantling of USAID amounts to nearly $2 billion in lost sales for US farmers. For smaller farmers, the termination of the Farm to School program and the Local Food Purchase Program for food banks have eliminated more than $1 billion in markets for fresh produce, while undermining the effort to provide healthy food to kids and people in need. And for farmers of all sizes, the suspension of contractual payments to farmers who’ve undertaken conservation, soil building, renewable energy, and other improvements to their farms is devastating. At least 30,000 of these farmers, who each expended tens of thousands of dollars based on USDA commitments, now find themselves in debt, unclear whether the promised reimbursements will ever materialize. But farmers aren’t the only rural folks getting screwed. Workers and small-business owners are increasingly worried about their livelihoods. Even before the latest round of tariffs, small-business confidence had declined for all three months of Trump’s presidency, with just one in five small business owners saying they expect sales and business conditions to improve in the near future. That uncertainty translates to less investment and hiring on the part of existing small businesses, and fewer new business start-ups. For workers in bigger companies, the surge in union organizing seen under the Biden administration is running into a wall of anti-worker actions from Trump. These include the firing of pro-worker members of the NLRB such as Jennifer Abruzzo, replaced by Crystal Carey, a lawyer whose firm represents notoriously anti-union Tesla and Amazon. Trump has also eliminated the $17 hourly minimum-wage requirement for federal contractors while working to completely dismantle unions representing federal workers. Sophie Lewis Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers Greg Grandin Obituary / John Nichols Veterans, who are more likely to live in rural areas, will be hurt especially hard by the double kneecapping of Medicaid and Veterans Affairs (VA). The New York Times reports that, in addition to layoffs, the VA has been rocked by DOGE’s abrupt return-to-work policy. VA psychiatrists who have, for decades, counseled veterans remotely, now suddenly have to conduct their sessions in open cubicles that lack privacy. Many of them are quitting in protest. Fourteen million (nearly one in five) rural adults rely on Medicaid, a program Republicans aim to cut by $880 billion (roughly 20 percent of the program) over the next decade. Already struggling rural hospitals and clinics rely on Medicaid funds to stay afloat. Over the past 10 years, nearly 200 rural hospitals have closed, leaving their patients stranded a hundred or more miles from the nearest emergency room. Most of the rural hospitals that do remain open have eliminated their maternity wards. Slashing Medicaid spending will trigger further hospital closures and strain already paltry substance abuse, mental health, and Indian health services. And then there are the millions of consumers just struggling to make ends meet. They’ve been hit not only by continued rising prices—the inflation rate has been between 2.4 and 3 percent since Trump took office—but by the elimination of protections from junk fees from banks and credit card companies. Joined by the Republican-controlled Senate, the Trump administration is eliminating the $8 late-fee cap instituted toward the end of Biden’s term, allowing companies to once again charge exorbitant fees to people who don’t pay on time. The lower average incomes of rural and working-class people make high prices and junk banking fees all the more difficult to manage. Donald Trump carried rural America by a 40-point margin. He promised forgotten Americans he would unrig the system, address the opioid epidemic, and restore small towns to health and prosperity. Even more than most of his predecessors, Trump has betrayed those who placed their trust in him. Reversing the tidal wave of destruction he has unleashed requires that we on the left do something we should have done a long time ago: open our doors wide to the farmers, miners, truckers, house cleaners, automakers, and working folks—white, brown, and Black—who picked him over us. We don’t just need them to regain Congress in 2026. We need them to save our country. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

Title: Elon Musk made big promises for Tesla, but 2 products are key to a rebound
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-analysts-react-earnings-robotaxis-affordable-cars-plan-timing-profit-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-23T09:18:54Z

Elon Musk made some big, exciting promises to Tesla investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call Tuesday — but he said they won't start paying off until mid-2026 or later. In the hours after Tesla reported, analysts said they were waiting for two things: a highly anticipated cheaper car and for Tesla's robotaxi to hit the market. Tesla's robotaxi, which was unveiled in October, is a fully autonomous vehicle that could be hailed on a ride-sharing app like a cab. Tesla has also been teasing a cheaper car — without disclosing its model or features — since 2020. Tesla missed expectations for the first quarter, reporting a 71% drop in profits and a 9% drop in revenue. Vehicle sales in particular suffered, with auto revenues down 20% year over year and vehicle deliveries down 13%. The EV maker has faced protests, boycotts, and attacks in recent months over Musk's work with the White House DOGE office. Musk announced on the earnings call that he'd be stepping back from DOGE in May, good news to investors who had been concerned that Tesla wasn't getting enough of the billionaire's attention. Tesla stock jumped about 7% after hours, but it is down 41% this year. Cantor Fitzgerald analysts led by Andres Sheppard highlighted the robotaxi and cheaper model in a note following earnings. They added that regulatory approval for full self-driving and robotaxi remains a key risk for Tesla's stock price. A more affordable model could open up Tesla's potential customer base and help the company compete internationally against low-cost Chinese EVs. Thomas Monteiro, an analyst at Investing.com, said, "Tesla has room for significant improvement." "If this is the worst it gets for Tesla, then certainly there must be some upside for the stock once tailwinds, such as the highly-awaited cheaper model and the Robotaxi, finally hit the market later this year," he said in a note following the earnings call. Yun Mei, an EV analyst at China Great Wall Securities, emphasized the robotaxi business in an appearance on Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. She said that she has "strong faith" in Tesla's ability to launch robotaxis because Musk's ownership of xAI gives Tesla a "first mover advantage" in the physical AI space. But she estimated that robotaxis would take around three years to pay off. Tesla has declined offers to pair up with existing ride-hailing platforms like Uber to market its Cybercab business, which could delay its robotaxis becoming mainstream. In a note published on the day the Cybercab was unveiled in October, Jefferies analysts wrote that Tesla may struggle without a partner like Uber or Lyft. Tesla's biggest cheerleader said that these product launches require Musk's focus, which has recently been on DOGE. "This quarter was a disaster," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a Tuesday appearance on CNBC after Tesla's earnings. "Everything that's going on here in terms of the opportunities around autonomous, lower cost vehicles, Cybercab, everything else — Musk needs to drive that," he added. Ives was more positive about Musk's decision to spend less time on DOGE. In a research note published after Tesla's analysts call, he hailed the move as a "turning point" for the company. "Musk recommitting as CEO at Tesla and basically leaving his DOGE role over the next month is the biggest and best possible news Tesla investors could have heard last night," Ives wrote, adding that Tesla had got its "biggest asset" back ahead of the crucial robotaxi and affordable EV launches. Musk also set some lofty goals for Tesla's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. Tesla is trying to diversify as EV sales have struggled. Slowing EV sales were an issue for Tesla even before Musk's work with DOGE, in part because of increased competition and consumers opting for hybrids over fully electric vehicles. Musk said he expects Tesla to have millions of fully autonomous Teslas on America's streets by the second half of next year. Musk added that Tesla would "start to see the prosperity of autonomy take effect in a material way around the middle of next year" or the second half of next year. The company has often missed target dates in the past, and Musk has previously acknowledged being overly optimistic about timelines. Musk also said Tesla was making good progress on Optimus, its humanoid robot, and it expected to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of the year. He said the company could be producing one million robots a year by 2029 or 2030. Jump to

Title: Why is bitcoin up so much right now

Key Points Institutional Adoption Bitcoin’s price has been boosted by increased institutional interest, especially through the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. These ETFs, like BlackRock’s, have made it easier for investors to buy Bitcoin, with assets under management expected to reach over $250 billion by 2025 (Forbes). This has broadened its appeal to mainstream and institutional investors, driving up demand. Regulatory and Political Influence The re-election of Donald Trump in November 2024 has created a pro-crypto environment. Trump’s policies, including plans for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and replacing SEC Chair Gary Gensler with a more crypto-friendly appointee, have boosted investor confidence (CNBC). Regulatory optimism globally, with clearer frameworks expected in 2025, has also supported the price surge. Macroeconomic Factors Lower interest rates, with major central banks expected to cut rates in 2025, have made Bitcoin more attractive as a risk-on asset. The Federal Reserve’s dovish signals, including potential rate cuts, have reduced the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin, enhancing its appeal as an inflation hedge (Euronews). Supply and Demand Dynamics The April 2024 halving reduced Bitcoin’s supply by lowering miner rewards, historically leading to price increases due to scarcity. Combined with sustained demand, especially from institutions, this has contributed to the current high price (Swan Bitcoin). Comprehensive Analysis of Bitcoin’s Price Surge as of April 23, 2025 This analysis provides a detailed examination of the factors contributing to Bitcoin’s recent price surge, offering insights for investors, analysts, and enthusiasts. The information is synthesized from recent articles and market analyses, ensuring a thorough understanding of the current market dynamics as of 12:50 PM +07 on Wednesday, April 23, 2025. Background and Context Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, has experienced a remarkable rally, reaching a new all-time high of over $93,000 in recent months, as reported by [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). This surge aligns with historical patterns, particularly the four-year market cycle, and is influenced by a confluence of macroeconomic, regulatory, and technical factors. The following sections detail these drivers, supported by data and expert insights. Key Drivers of the Price Surge Institutional Adoption and Bitcoin ETFs One of the most significant catalysts for Bitcoin’s price increase is the surge in institutional adoption, particularly through the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in 2024. These ETFs, which began trading in January 2024, have broadened Bitcoin’s appeal to mainstream investors, with expected assets under management (AUM) projected to cross $250 billion by 2025, as noted by CNBC. The increased demand from ETFs, coupled with fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors, has improved liquidity and potentially contributed to overvaluation, as discussed in [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). This institutional participation is evident in the rising BTC supply among long-term holders, with waning spending pressure, as highlighted by [Cointelegraph]([invalid url, do not cite]). Regulatory Developments and Political Influence Regulatory clarity and favorable policies have significantly boosted Bitcoin’s price. The re-election of Donald Trump in November 2024, with his pro-crypto platform, has been a major driver. Trump vowed to replace SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who stepped down in January 2025, and indicated plans for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve using seized funds, as reported by CNBC. This shift towards a more favorable regulatory environment is expected to boost institutional flows, with experts anticipating increased adoption by corporations and nation-states, including five Nasdaq 100 companies and five nation-states adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, according to [CNBC]([invalid url, do not cite]). Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic trends, particularly the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, have played a crucial role. Earlier in 2025, the Fed signaled dovish policies, expecting to cut interest rates twice, and kept the benchmark rate on hold while acknowledging tariff-driven inflation as “transitory,” as reported by [Cointelegraph]([invalid url, do not cite]). Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin, making it an attractive inflation hedge. This is supported by Bitcoin’s 83% correlation with global liquidity, as noted in [Finance Magnates]([invalid url, do not cite]), amid rising U.S. debt and economic uncertainties. Bitcoin Halving and Supply Dynamics The Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, which reduced miner rewards, has historically been a bullish trigger for prices. This event, occurring every four years, reduces the supply of new Bitcoins, increasing scarcity and supporting price appreciation. Historical data shows post-halving price increases, such as reaching $1,100 in November 2013 and $64,000 in April 2021, as discussed in Swan Bitcoin. The 2024 halving, combined with sustained demand, has contributed to the current bull run, as noted by [CNBC]([invalid url, do not cite]). Market Sentiment and Historical Cycles The crypto market is currently in a growth phase, potentially peaking between 2024 and 2025, aligning with the historical four-year market cycle, as per [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). Positive news, such as regulatory acceptance and technological advancements, has created a bullish sentiment, while social media and online forums have influenced retail investor decisions, as discussed in [OSL]([invalid url, do not cite]). Fear of missing out (FOMO) has led to sudden buying surges, further driving prices, while fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can trigger sell-offs, though current sentiment remains optimistic. Expert Predictions and Market Outlook Experts have made bullish predictions, adding to the market’s upward momentum. Anthony Scaramucci predicts Bitcoin could reach $170,000 in the next year, Michael Saylor highlights a supply shock post-halving, and Tom Lee forecasts $150,000 short-term and $500,000 in five years, as reported by [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). Digital Coin Price estimates an average of $210,644.67 in 2025, with a peak at $230,617.59, while Wallet Investor projects $103,675 in one year and $196,072 in five years. These predictions, while speculative, reflect strong market fundamentals and growing institutional trust. Controversies and Bearish Concerns Despite the bullish outlook, there are concerns, including Bitcoin’s high energy consumption and evolving anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, as noted in [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). Some experts, like Mike McGlone from Bloomberg Intelligence, predict potential corrections, with Bitcoin dropping 20% in 2025 while gold surged 16%, as reported by [Finance Magnates]([invalid url, do not cite]). However, these bearish views are not the consensus, with most analysts expecting continued growth due to institutional support. Technical Analysis and Price Movements Technical indicators also support the bullish trend. Based on data from April 22, 2025, Bitcoin’s 200-day simple moving average (SMA) is expected to rise to $93,964 by May 22, 2025, and the 50-day SMA to $104,173, with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 58.80 indicating a neutral position, as per [CoinCodex]([invalid url, do not cite]). Bitcoin tested the lower trendline of an ascending channel pattern in March 2025, leading to bounces of 7.50%, 6.60%, and 7.60%, facing resistance at $87,830, as reported by [Cointelegraph]([invalid url, do not cite]). Comparative Performance Bitcoin has appreciated faster than the S&P 500 and gold, currently at 10% of gold’s market cap, with potential to reach 20% in 2025 and 25% long-term, equating to $250,000, as per CNBC. This performance underscores its role as a reserve asset, with increasing recognition through exchange-traded products (ETPs) and adoption trends. Detailed Breakdown of Factors Conclusion Bitcoin’s price surge as of April 23, 2025, is a result of institutional adoption, favorable regulations, macroeconomic trends, the April 2024 halving, and bullish market sentiment. While controversies like environmental impact exist, the consensus leans towards continued growth, supported by expert predictions and technical indicators. Investors should remain cautious of potential corrections, but the current trajectory suggests a robust bull run. Key Citations Key Points Recent Price Surge Bitcoin has seen a significant price increase, reaching over $93,000 recently, likely due to increased demand from institutional investors and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. These ETFs, expected to manage over $250 billion by 2025, have broadened Bitcoin’s appeal to mainstream investors. Regulatory and Political Influence Favorable regulatory developments, especially under the new U.S. administration following Donald Trump’s re-election, have boosted investor confidence. Trump’s pro-crypto policies, including plans for a national Bitcoin reserve, have created a bullish market sentiment. Economic Factors Lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve, with dovish signals earlier in 2025, have made Bitcoin more attractive as an inflation hedge, reducing the opportunity cost of holding it compared to other investments. Market Dynamics The April 2024 halving, which reduced Bitcoin’s supply, historically triggers price increases due to increased scarcity. Additionally, the market is in a growth phase, aligning with a four-year cycle, with experts predicting a peak between 2024 and 2025.

As Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) prepares to report its first-quarter 2025 earnings after the bell Tuesday, investors are watching closely for updates on two long-delayed projects: the company’s affordable EV and its autonomous robotaxi platform. The two initiatives once were expected to define Tesla’s next chapter — but concerns about CEO Elon Musk’s political entanglements are clouding the outlook. Analysts, including Wedbush’s Dan Ives, have voiced worries that Musk’s leadership focus has splintered. Since accepting his controversial role in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has faced protests and backlash that analysts say may be affecting the brand. Tesla’s stock has plunged 40% year-to-date, impacted by falling deliveries, fierce competition from Chinese EV giants like BYD (BYDDY+2.70%), and political headwinds. But there’s one group of investors that’s thriving: short sellers. According to S3 Partners, traders betting against Tesla have made an estimated $11.5 billion in profits so far this year — making it the most profitable short globally, surpassing Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%). Short interest has climbed 15% as bearish sentiment builds. Public perception is also shifting. A recent CNBC (CMCSA+1.99%) All-America Economic Survey found that 47% of Americans now hold a negative view of Tesla, indicating significant potential challenges for the brand’s image. Shares rose about 5% Tuesday amid a pre-earnings and larger market bounce. But with investor nerves fraying, Tesla’s Q1 report could be a decisive moment in the company’s 2025 story — for bulls and bears alike.

Title: Google's next move shows us why cozying up to leaders is a bad idea!

Summary: A new report states that Google might move Pixel production over to India. This is a move to avoid the harsh 46% tariffs placed on Taiwan, which is where most of Google’s devices are built. In India, the tariffs are only 26%, which is significantly lower. Do you remember hearing the news of wealthy tech figures donating money to Donald Trump’s inauguration by the millions? We saw Tim Cook do it along with Mark Zuckerberg and others. Well, Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, also donated money to the inauguration. That’s what makes this new report all the more tragic. The very man they donated to is wreaking havoc on the global economy. He’s also playing chicken with countries that build many of the products we use every day, and this has caused huge vibrations throughout the stock market. Google is now starting to feel the pressure from the situation, and its next move should be a cautionary tale. As you may know, President Donald Trump is dealing out tariffs like he’s at a poker game. As such, importing goods from many countries around the world will become much more expensive. These taxes will result in higher prices for consumers, but it will also result in high prices for companies providing goods and services. Google’s Pixel devices are built in Taiwan, but that country was hit with a 46% tariff. This means that importing its Pixel devices from Taiwan over to the U.S. will cost the company more. Raising the import cost could result in much more expensive devices for the consumers. Pixel phones aren’t exactly the budget-friendly option it once was. A new report hints that Google is in talks with Dixon Technologies and Foxconn at the moment. It could be planning on moving Pixel production over to India. As it stands, India was hit with a 26% tariff, which is much lower than Taiwan’s tariff. The situation is extremely fluid at the moment. Vice President Vance flew over to India to speak with Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The talks were over potentially reaching a trade deal later this year. If that happens, then things might be better for Google if it moves production to India. We’re sure that the executives over at Apple have been pulling their hair out over the drama. The sky-high tariffs placed on Chinese goods have been threatening to triple the price of the iPhone. As such, Apple has been asking the president to exempt it from the tariffs. Even though there was an exemption, the company could still be in trouble. Well, it looks like the folks at Google are in a similar boat. We all know that Trump favors big business, so we’re sure that’s why they donated to his inaugural fund. We’re also sure that it’s because he relaxed the regulations on AI technology, which companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI were happy about. However, now they’re regretting their choice at the moment. We’re seeing turmoil across several industries, and companies are having to uproot their operations. While the trade deal might help Google if it moves to India, it’s still ridiculous that the company now has to move its production to an entirely different country just to deal with a decision from the man that its CEO helped get re-elected.

Bitcoin (BTC) has tagged the $91,500 level for the first time since March 7th as institutional holdings of the flagship crypto asset enjoy a significant boost. According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, BlackRock and several other large US institutions have upped their Bitcoin stacks to back their BTC-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Says Lookonchain, citing data from Arkham, “BTC is back to $90,000. Fidelity, BlackRock, ARK Invest, Bitwise are all accumulating BTC.” According to crypto data aggregator SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs saw $381 million in flows on Monday, April 21, with none of the 12 ETFs seeing net outflows. The flows are the largest recorded since January 30. However, Ethereum (ETH) ETFs haven’t seen the same amount of demand. According to SoSoValue, Ethereum ETFs have suffered net outflows for the majority of days since mid-February, including today. But some under-the-radar whales have been spotted on-chain accumulating ETH from crypto exchanges. Says Lookonchain, “Whales are still accumulating ETH. 0xd81E withdrew 1,900 ETH ($3.1M) from Gate.io again [on Tuesday]. Since Feb 15, this wallet has withdrawn 48,477 ETH ($100.35M) from Gate.io and is currently sitting on a $21M loss. Meanwhile, 0x3bd2 withdrew 2,600 ETH ($4.26M) from Binance after being inactive for a year.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $90,777 while ETH is priced at $1,692.

Title: A software engineer's success often depends on their relationship with their manager, says ex-Amazon technical director
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/software-engineer-success-can-depend-manager-relationship-former-amazon-director-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-22T17:41:33Z
Full Content:
A large part of an engineer's success is often tied to how they navigate their relationship with their manager, a former Amazon engineering director, Dave Anderson, said. "I would actually say, as a manager, even, like 50% of that performance, frequently, is your relationship with your manager and your team. How will you fit in with the team, with your peers, with your manager?" he said on a recent episode of "The Pragmatic Engineer," a podcast. Underestimating your supervisor's influence can be particularly dangerous at a company like Amazon, he added. As can be the case at other companies, a manager's decisions can shape the future of their direct report, from determining how much they're compensated to how far up the career ladder they climb. The influence a manager can have over an engineer's trajectory isn't something to shrug off, Anderson said. "I think the mistake that people will sometimes make is like, 'My manager doesn't influence my job that much because I can work independently,' or, you know, 'I don't need to figure this out with my manager because I can, you know, work with my peers, or I have this great engineer on my team I can work with,'" Anderson said. But if your manager doesn't like you, he added, you're "never ever" going to be able to snag a promotion. It's also important to remember that managers are often asked to point out a number of team members "who are not doing great," Anderson said. If you are, when compared with other members of your team, the "least effective," he added, you could be on the chopping block. "If you look around the room and you're thinking, 'Yep, I'm the worst one here' — that's not a great situation to ever be in. It's just never safe," Anderson said. "And at Amazon, it's definitely not safe. Some other companies where they just might do layoffs once every four years, you might be safe for quite a while. But Amazon has this sort of regular cycle." In response to a request for comment from Business Insider, Margaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, said Anderson's experiences were his alone. "These claims reflect the opinion of one individual who worked at Amazon years ago. They're not based in fact, and aren't indicative of what it was like to work here then or what it's like today," Callahan said. "We're proud to be one of the most sought-after employers in the world and to have ranked in the top three in LinkedIn's Top Companies for eight years running." Anderson said that if an engineer's relationship with their manager isn't good, there can be an escape hatch of sorts: moving teams before being managed out. "So many times I've had someone who was either doing amazing on one team, they moved to the next team, and they're, like, actually not doing well at all, or someone who was not doing well escapes to another team before they get fired — and they do well," he said. If you start to hear rumblings from further up the chain of command, Anderson thinks it could be in your best interest to make a change, and swiftly. "This is, like, my sneaky recommendation for anyone is like — if you start to hear performance feedback whatsoever from your management chain, if you have any opportunity at all, get off your team fast as possible," he said. In a follow-up email, Anderson told BI that in a "great number of situations," he'd seen success prove itself to be at least partially dependent on team fit. "I've seen poor performers turn into great performers, and great performers turn into poor performers — and the only factor was them switching teams," he said. "In particular, switching teams to a place where they didn't know their manager. I don't think people fundamentally changed — so the only reasonable conclusion is that team fit (in particular, their relationship with their manager) is the deciding factor." Anderson doesn't suggest disavowing any negative feedback you receive and bailing out into a different section of the company on a whim. It depends, he said, on the relationship you've formed with your supervisor and whether you have faith in their advice. "Now, if you trust your manager, they might be actually just giving you honest feedback, which you'd like to be able to receive," he said. "But for the most part, if you've been working for someone for three years and suddenly they start giving you performance feedback, that's a really bad sign." Anderson added: "If you run for the hills fast enough, it's possible you'll get away before they flag you in the system as non-transferable." Jump to

April 22, 2025 13:33 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, April 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 28, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 28, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

You may as well, along with plenty of people you know who may despise Elon Musk. My contribution to Musk’s biggest company is about $26 of the roughly $2,000 per month I aim to send to an index fund that tracks more or less the entire U.S. stock market. Tesla is one of the biggest companies in the market, and so it accounts for 1.31 percent of my investment. (As a proper adherent to the Boglehead strategy I also get my little piece of 3,561 other companies.) Twenty-six bucks a month adds up in eye-watering fashion when millions of people send their investment dollars into this type of fund. Tesla has lots of retail investors who just like owning Tesla stock. (I once sat in an Uber and watched my driver monitor Tesla’s intraday movements on a mounted phone while the car was moving, a scene I wish I was making up for this story.) Even still, institutions hold most of Tesla’s stock. Three huge ones—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—collectively own more than 17 percent of the company. Together, those three have more of the stock than Musk does. Their stakes are worth well over $100 billion of a $700 billion company. They invest the money of retirees and pensioners and who knows who else. All of those people are pumping Tesla’s stock, a few dollars at a time. Even so, Tesla’s stock is bleeding out this year, as Musk gets negative attention for his practically limitless reign over much of the federal government. The S&P 500 has lost 12 percent on the year, but Tesla has lost a much grislier 40 percent. People are fleeing Tesla’s stock at rates that far exceed other stocks or the index funds that track that whole kit and caboodle. The effort to rein in Musk by crushing Tesla’s stock is now a major cultural movement. Its tactics are demonstrations at Tesla showrooms, flyers on windshields, posts on social media, and, for a tiny minority, property damage. The movement hasn’t yet arrived at what could be one of its most effective tools. Probably, this is because “the movement” is not a coordinated front between run-of-the-mill Musk opponents and financial professionals who would like to make some money off them while also maybe fighting Musk for sincere reasons. But eventually, it will get there. The biggest unturned stone in the battle against Musk is the one around exchange-traded funds—baskets of stocks that you buy in a package, with the price updating all day unlike mutual funds, which for now give Tesla’s stock a useful insurance policy. JPMorgan counts about 3,500 ETFs listed in the United States, holding more than $9 trillion in assets as of last October. There are only 4,300 publicly traded American companies, and that number has fallen hard since the mid-1990s as companies have gotten bought up, failed, or gone private. Just domestically, before accounting for thousands of non-U.S. ETFs, we are verging on becoming a country that has more ETFs offering various baskets of stocks than we have actual stocks. There are ETFs for pretty much any concept a financial professional could dream up and sell to investors. The biggest ones track the whole stock market or the S&P 500 and have roughly half a trillion dollars in assets under management each. The market then gets much more targeted. There are countless industry ETFs, tracking health care companies or industrials or consumer staples or semiconductor or electric vehicle companies, or whatever else. Eventually it gets downright bespoke. You want the whole S&P 500 except for the “Magnificent 7” companies that account for about a third of the S&P 500’s value? A fund for that launched last year. Lately it’s losing much less than the broad market, in substantial part because Tesla is one of the seven companies it doesn’t buy. The ETF market can also be mean, picking on specific people. One ETF just shorts stocks that famous investor Cathie Wood likes. For a few glorious moments, there was an “Inverse Jim Cramer” fund, long may it live. The idea seems so obvious that it’s head-scratching nobody with a big platform has so much as called for it yet: One of the best ways to sting Tesla’s stock, and Musk by extension, would be to create broad index funds that exclude Tesla and thus don’t put their investors’ money into the stock. Ideally, all Americans who have the good fortune to have extra money or a retirement fund match should be encouraged to put away what they can, and specifically to put it in broad market index funds. Those funds are a crucial source of demand for Tesla’s stock, though. If you’d like to put your money to work for your future but think Musk is a threat to your country’s future, you might be taking some contradictory steps all the time. What is to be done about this conflict? The most aggressive option for Tesla Takedown proponents would be to mount a campaign demanding that the Vanguards and BlackRocks of the world remove Tesla from their major index funds. That would be a bad and doomed option. The companies would not do it, nor should they, because they are offering index funds that track the stock market, and Tesla is one of the biggest companies on the stock market. Also, in less noble reasoning, these enormous asset managers are not going to pick an overt fight with Musk and by extension the entire Republican Party. (They are already on the back foot over “woke” investing, and this would get that party going again.) There is another option, though: Find a financial firm that wants to make tons of money by selling an investment product to millions of furious liberals while charging a reasonable fee, and demand that Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission stop them. It would not be hard, or counter to the rules that typically govern the ETF market, for an enterprising issuer to launch a fund that includes the whole stock market except Tesla. There’s already the one that excludes seven mega-companies including Tesla. It’s not clear that there would be any legal problem with launching an explicitly anti-Tesla ETF and marketing it as such. But perhaps you, a financial professional attuned to risk, want to be safe. You could launch the Properly Valued Companies ETF, which does not buy the stock of car companies that have regularly traded at a price of more than 200 times their earnings per share. Who knows how many companies that would cover? Perhaps you could launch the Focused Bosses Fund (ticker: $FBF), which buys the whole S&P 500 except for companies whose CEOs also run other multibillion-dollar companies and hold government posts. Who could blame you for catering to investors who want disciplined management? The ETF market will find a way to develop pretty much any product that people want to buy, even if that product is financially dubious. This one would not be financially dubious, and if marketed well, I suspect many, many people would want to buy it. If an ETF issuer gets more than $50 million into its fund, and quite possibly less than that, it should be making money by charging a fee of much less than 1 percent per year on its invested dollars. There are more than 50 million American dollars out there that are poised to find their way into a non-Tesla, broad-market ETF. It would take some time for an offering like this to affect Tesla’s share price to an extent we would notice. But stocks go up when people (or index funds) buy them, and they go down when people sell them. Offering a break in the link between investing in the whole stock market and boosting Tesla’s share price would have the latter effect. It’s also the sort of thing that you could imagine Musk spinning out over, causing him to go on late-night X tirades about. He seems like a pretty distractible fellow. Some of the second-order problems with this approach are clear. The clearest is that in the current version of the U.S. government, one that finds fresh ways all the time to enrich Musk, the SEC might never approve a fund that positioned itself so overtly against the world’s richest person. That’s no reason not to make the government say no, though. The opportunity is there for Musk’s opponents, the sort of people who don’t already own Tesla stock or cars, to vote with their portfolios. The chance is also there for an investment business to profit, even cynically, from that desire. Isn’t this just a matter of time? Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

The companies would not do it, nor should they, because they are offering index funds that track the stock market, and Tesla is one of the biggest companies on the stock market. Also, in less noble reasoning, these enormous asset managers are not going to pick an overt fight with Musk and by extension the entire Republican Party. (They are already on the back foot over “woke” investing, and this would get that party going again.) There is another option, though: Find a financial firm that wants to make tons of money by selling an investment product to millions of furious liberals while charging a reasonable fee, and demand that Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission stop them. It would not be hard, or counter to the rules that typically govern the ETF market, for an enterprising issuer to launch a fund that includes the whole stock market except Tesla. There’s already the one that excludes seven mega-companies including Tesla. It’s not clear that there would be any legal problem with launching an explicitly anti-Tesla ETF and marketing it as such. But perhaps you, a financial professional attuned to risk, want to be safe. You could launch the Properly Valued Companies ETF, which does not buy the stock of car companies that have regularly traded at a price of more than 200 times their earnings per share. Who knows how many companies that would cover? Perhaps you could launch the Focused Bosses Fund (ticker: $FBF), which buys the whole S&P 500 except for companies whose CEOs also run other multibillion-dollar companies and hold government posts. Who could blame you for catering to investors who want disciplined management? The ETF market will find a way to develop pretty much any product that people want to buy, even if that product is financially dubious. This one would not be financially dubious, and if marketed well, I suspect many, many people would want to buy it. If an ETF issuer gets more than $50 million into its fund, and quite possibly less than that, it should be making money by charging a fee of much less than 1 percent per year on its invested dollars. There are more than 50 million American dollars out there that are poised to find their way into a non-Tesla, broad-market ETF. It would take some time for an offering like this to affect Tesla’s share price to an extent we would notice. But stocks go up when people (or index funds) buy them, and they go down when people sell them. Offering a break in the link between investing in the whole stock market and boosting Tesla’s share price would have the latter effect. It’s also the sort of thing that you could imagine Musk spinning out over, causing him to go on late-night X tirades about. He seems like a pretty distractible fellow. Some of the second-order problems with this approach are clear. The clearest is that in the current version of the U.S. government, one that finds fresh ways all the time to enrich Musk, the SEC might never approve a fund that positioned itself so overtly against the world’s richest person. That’s no reason not to make the government say no, though. The opportunity is there for Musk’s opponents, the sort of people who don’t already own Tesla stock or cars, to vote with their portfolios. The chance is also there for an investment business to profit, even cynically, from that desire. Isn’t this just a matter of time? Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Title: Four Value Stock Picks From Two Top Managers For Q2 2025

ByJacob Wolinsky ByJacob Wolinsky, Contributor. NEW YORK, NY - JANUARY 16: A sign hangs on the BlackRock offices on January 16, 2014 in New York ... More City. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Value stocks bounced in the second half of last year, and several experts are saying the day of value is returning. However, BlackRock is warning that investors might be underweight value stocks at a time when the markets could start shifting. Additionally, history has shown that savvy stock picking is a better way to gain access to value stocks rather than by tracking one of the value indexes. Here are four value stock picks from two leading managers as the second quarter goes into full swing. In a recent interview, Judson Traphagen of Plough Penny Partners chose Lesaka Technologies (NASDAQ:LSAK) and Veon (NASDAQ:VEON), which are trading at around $4.50 and $45 a share, respectively. Meanwhile, Alyx Wood of Kernow Asset Management selected Card Factory (LON:CARD) and Kistos (LON:KIST), which are trading at around GBX90 and GBX129 a share. Plough Penny Partners is a long-biased, fundamental growth fund that prefers to target holding periods of between three to five years. The fund typically holds a concentrated portfolio of 10 to 20 long positions with a handful of opportunistic shorts. Plough Penny specifically targets high-growth technology companies, investing globally in fintech, software and internet companies. Kernow Asset Management uses a long-short equity strategy in search of contrarian alpha from U.K. equities. The firm pairs fundamental analysis with catalyst-driven mean reversion investments. Kernow seeks market inefficiencies and tries to determine how they work and how valuation gaps might be closed. Traphagen describes Lesaka as an under-the-radar small-cap fintech company undergoing secular growth and in the early stages of a multi-year trajectory. The company’s business is largely in southern Africa. Comparing Lesaka to StoneCo and Nubank in Latin America, Traphagen believes it’s perhaps the best way for U.S. investors to target Africa’s largely untapped growth market for fintech. In the same way Square serves U.S. customers, Lesaka provides digital financial solutions to consumers and merchants in southern Africa. Traphagen was initially drawn to Lesaka Technologies because he’s always seeking companies with great management, rapid revenue growth, and expanding margins that are operating in massive total addressable markets. He also seeks companies with solid unit economics and that have “barely penetrated their target markets.” “We have made money in emerging markets fintech stocks like Nubank and StoneCo in Latin America and had read that Africa was the next big market in fintech, so we looked for a stock to benefit from that trend,” Traphagen explained. “LSAK is that stock.” In the short term, he believes Lesaka Technologies is worth $7.50 a share, but he suspects it might end up being a multi-bagger in the long term. Veon is a telecommunications company that operates in frontier markets, providing traditional telco services and newer digital products and services. In recent years, it has sped up its digital products and services and now generates a sizable share of its revenues from digital products and services. Like with Lesaka, Traphagen believes the opportunity in Veon exists because it’s still largely unknown to U.S. investors, operating in markets that are essentially alien to U.S. investors, although it trades on the Nasdaq. Traphagen was initially attracted to Veon because of its valuation, but then he discovered its “compelling” total addressable market and opportunity for digital products in an area where competition by U.S. technology companies is lacking. He also was attracted to Veon because the company is ambitiously de-levering, selling off non-core assets and repurchasing shares. Card Factory is a top greeting card retailer in the U.K. that also sells gifts, party supplies and related products. The company was founded based on the opportunity to sell greeting cards at much lower price points than competitors via a vertically integrated business model that includes manufacturing cards in-house. Interestingly, Wood was initially drawn to Card Factory as a potential short position during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, the company had high debt and was facing the possibility of bankruptcy. However, after Wood ran the fundamentals and conducted the people and strategy work, he found the company to be of higher quality than he had expected. “This made it a long idea as soon as they started growing profits and the debt was cleared by cashflow,” Wood explained. “The business is trading at a distressed price. This is at odds to the great balance sheet, and profits are set to double. It’s a hidden quality growth stock. So we did more work and linked our trade journey to the partnerships, which are free growth centers.” Management expects to double their profits over the next three years, although Wood said the market is skeptical because of the seemingly untested partnerships and international expansion. However, he added that they’re “comfortable with being paid to take the risk for free.” Those partnerships are basically new places where Card Factory’s cards are being sold on stands within stores rather than just on the High Street. Kistos is an independent, integrated energy company that has both upstream and midstream operations that span international markets. Wood was initially drawn to the stock by the 350% gap with their valuation in the Kernow Valuation Framework, which begins with valuing companies using their proprietary fundamental bottom-up process. He feels Kistos has a clear edge over other oil and gas companies because it extracts value from overlooked assets “more efficiently than almost anyone else.” Wood estimates the company’s intrinsic value at £350 million, although its market cap is only a mere £100 million currently. He said the company’s production is set to almost double this year to 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and the market is ignoring this potential. According to BlackRock, growth stocks accounted for 37% of the S&P 500 as of the end of November, versus the historical average of 24%. This was due to the heavy favoritism assigned to growth stocks in the first half of 2024 as investors widely preferred mega-cap technology stocks. However, that high concentration could unintentionally leave many investor portfolios coming up short in the diversification department, meaning a greater chance of missing out on the upside from rallies in value stocks like the one that started in July 2024. Thus, investors might want to take a closer look at their portfolios to see where they stand in the value-versus-growth.

Posted on 04/22/2025 7:51:17 AM PDT by SunkenCiv Now that Pat Gelsinger is no longer occupying the corner office at embattled chipmaker Intel (INTC), he can acknowledge one thing about the semiconductor industry.Nvidia (NVDA) has a wide, wide lead over its rivals on the tech front..."They have built meaningful moats around their franchise," he added.Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around Intel for more than three years. He slashed thousands of jobs, improved costs, secured CHIPS Act funding, built chip foundries, and promised fast AI chips that could compete with Nvidia and AMD (AMD).He was fired in early December amid missed financial targets, lack of progress on the AI chip front, and a cash drain on the foundry business.Intel's fourth quarter sales fell 7% year over year to $14.3 billion, and net earnings plunged 76%. The company forecasts it will only break even on the profit line this year.Analysts think Nvidia may post upward of $5 per share in earnings in 2025. Nvidia's stock is up 1,220% over the past five years, while Intel's has dropped 69%.Intel announced Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO in March.Tan was the CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) from 2009 to 2021. After serving on Intel's board for two years, he left in August 2024 following clashes with Gelsinger over how to position the business.Tan frequently pushed for a better artificial intelligence strategy to take on Nvidia and faster decision making at the notoriously bureaucratic Intel...Tan will get to outline his strategy publicly -- and detail how he will navigate Trump tariffs -- when the company announces first quarter results on April 24 after the market close.

Intel Agencies Caught in Massive Voter Fraud USAWatchdog.com ^ | 4FEB2025 | Greg Hunter Posted on 2/5/2025, 10:19:32 AM by Tom Tetroxide Dr. Jerome Corsi has a Harvard PhD in political science. He has written more than 30 books with many of them becoming best-sellers. Dr. Corsi’s latest project is about voter fraud. Corsi says he can prove Donald Trump really did win in 2020. There were also countless down-ballot thefts in 2020 and in 2024. Dr. Corsi and others have uncovered a grand scam that dates back to the early 2000’s that has cheated people into office that actually lost. The architects of the steal can be traced back to U.S. intel agencies. Dr. Corsi created a website for this project called GodsFiveStones.com and explains, “GodsFiveStones.com is named after the David and Goliath Bible story. This is when David picks up five smooth stones from the brook, and they are the exact ones needed to kill Goliath. That’s what we are aiming to do is to kill this Goliath of voter fraud.” The voter fraud is hidden in the voter rolls that every state government maintains. Corsi says, “You look at state records, and there might be 12 million records and there might be 2 million false records. They look legitimate until you really analyze them, and then you realize they are duplicates or clones. If you send out people to canvas them, there is nobody there. They are falsified and hidden in the data base. It’s like a card marking scheme. . . . They did not use the algorithms in the 2024 Election for President because we were on the lookout for it. The down-ballot elections (House, Governor and Senate) used these algorithms, and they cheated.” Corsi estimates they cheated 20 House Democrats and 5 Democrat Senators into office in 2024. snip I recommend “The nVidia Way” book. It’s an interesting read, much of the success is around their culture. Jensen just outworks everyone, requiring it of everyone. They behave as though the next breakthrough in tech will kill the company, so be first and never get complacent. That said, it seems he sacrifices his life to just work. I was in a company bought by Intel. They were constantly distracted by different ideas. They seemed to have no focus. They also didn’t listen, there was a certain arrogance about the Intel employees. They’re way behind in AI hardware and software. It’s not just the hardware. The CUDA software opened doors into unanticipated markets. That said, from a stock point of view, imho...they’re going to enter the ‘trough of disillusionment’ on the Gartner Hype Cycle. The possibilities hit regulatory aspects. The recent market performance may be reflecting this but it’s hard to see due to the other volatility (e.g. tariffs). Long term buy, looking for another dip - over 30% down since start of the year. I used to work for Intel, but I was in and out before Pat came to power. But a good friend who worked there for a LONG time used to work for Pat and says that he’s a very smart engineer, and he thought the right person for the job as CEO. When things didn’t go so well under his leadership my friend said he believed the issue was that Pat was an engineer, and that the board of directors (who make all the decisions ANYWAY), didn’t WANT an engineer to lead the company, they wanted more of a finance guy. So here we are. A different world but when I was supporting government development projects the two big leaders would be Program Manager (focusing on Cost and Schedule) and Chief Engineer (focusing on technical requirements). I never worked with a Chief Engineer who gave a fig about technical requirements. The Chief Engineers always focused on Cost and Schedule. Always the money. Never the engineering. I know a bunch of former Intel people who now work at AMD they say Intel is in a death spiral and while AMD needs to spend and upgrade their Server lab spaces they are poised to kick some Intel ass. The only thing the new CEO brings is customer feedback on fabless design needs. True something very missing from Intel but it might not be enough. DEI has destroyed the inner workings of Intel started by Obama. It has not been the same place since Paul Otellini retired. Intel had a long track record of forcing out experienced people and replacing them with Indian workers. Those experienced engineers went to AMD, Nvidia, Apple and IBM. I went to IBM where for the first time after 30 years, felt like I was being treated like a professional. You were just a number at Intel.

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Asian equities were mixed despite a stronger U.S. dollar overnight, gold surging, and yesterday’s U.S. equity downdraft, as Taiwan underperformed. The Yen was resilient, giving some validation to today’s Financial Times article on Japanese institutions selling U.S. Treasuries, though it is hard to say for sure. The U.S. dollar’s decline, stock market decline, and asset flow out of the U.S. were topics in Chinese media, though likely being repeated globally. The positions of star active fund managers, revealing their positions, garnered attention on a light economic data and policy day. One manager’s top positions were revealed as Tencent, Alibaba, Kweichow Moutai, Meituan, Wuliangye, Yum China, and CNOOC. Another manager focused solely on Mainland China A shares revealed holdings in Sokon, Eve, Naura, and Trina Solar. After the close, Central Huijin Investment Ltd., the financial arm of China’s sovereign wealth fund, updated its positions in four Mainland equity ETFs with increases of 363 million shares, 501 million shares, 117 million shares, and 157 million shares. The SWF’s positions are in the tens of billions, so the Q1 increases aren’t massive in my opinion. Coincidentally, Reuters published an article on retail investors and the National Team buying during market hours that garnered attention. There continues to be coverage of the government’s rare statements on stabilizing the stock market. Hong Kong’s volumes were strong on a positive day. JD.com was down -6.32% and Meituan was down -4.62%, as they battle for restaurant delivery, which weighed on both stocks as investors fear margin compression. The outcome of these pyrrhic victories has been painful to watch, as firms undercut one another to garner market share, as profitability falls to the wayside. This reminds me of the battle between Uber and Didi. Mainland investors bought a very large net $2.753 billion of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect, as the Hong Kong Tracker ETF, the Hang Seng China Enterprise ETF, Tencent, and Alibaba were the largest beneficiaries of inflows. 50% of Hong Kong turnover was from Mainland investors via Southbound Stock Connect. Healthcare was the top-performing sector in Hong Kong, up +6.52%, and Mainland China, up +0.49%, on the belief that the sector will be resilient to the U.S.-China trade war. Mainland technology and growth stocks, including electronic equipment, semiconductors, software, and electrical equipment, underperformed. A sell-side economist dropped their 2025 China GDP target to 4% from 4.5%. Hong Kong and Mainland China’s resilience has garnered shockingly little attention from global investors. The CEOs of Walmart, Home Depot, and Target visited President Donald Trump at the White House yesterday. While the companies’ statements called the meeting “productive” and “constructive,” the companies and their customers will unfortunately be adversely impacted by tariffs. Hopefully, the U.S. and China can make some progress, as some have speculated that Nvidia’s Jensen Huang’s visit to Beijing could be his attempt to act as a bridge between the two sides.

The Event store restocks hourly on the hour (for example: 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, and so on). If it’s in stock, the Candy Blossom seed costs 10,000,000$ to buy. Despite its hefty price tag, this plant is worth the investment since it’s one of the meta seeds available currently.

Title: Tesla wants to bring the Cybertruck down to earth

Good morning. A new research paper co-authored by Google's David Silver is the talk of the tech industry. It boldly announces a radical new era for AI — it also reads as a "dis" of OpenAI, BI's Alistair Barr writes. In today's big story, Tesla's highly anticipated earnings report comes after the bell. We're breaking down what Wall Street will be watching — and why Tesla really wants the Cybertruck to be a working man's truck. What's on deck Markets: President Trump escalated his feud with the Fed, and investors are nervous. Tech: Internal Microsoft email to managers details new policies aimed at culling low performers. Business: The FTC is arguing that Uber's subscription service is too deceptive in a new suit. But first, bringing the Cybertruck back to earth. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The big story Think less DeLorean, more F-150. The Cybertruck is ditching its otherworldly aesthetic to reposition itself as a working man's vehicle, BI's Grace Kay writes. Less than two years after release, Cybertrucks are now piling up in sales lots, fewer than 50,000 vehicles have been delivered, and some owners have become political targets over CEO Elon Musk's association with President Donald Trump. So, what's a car company to do? Enter the quiet rebrand. Tesla sales workers told BI the vehicle needs to appeal to the traditional truck buyer. In mid-April, Tesla redesigned its product page for the first time since the truck's release. Gone are the futuristic aesthetics and allusions to Mars. Now, the vehicle is fit for construction work or a family outing. Tesla is preparing to deliver first-quarter earnings. It faces sluggish delivery numbers, a brand crisis, and a stock price down over 43% this year. It's looking for a boost. Here are a few things that Wall Street will be watching: Impact of Trump tariffs. Tesla's chief financial officer said on the company's last earnings call that, if implemented, tariffs would affect the automaker's business and profitability. He said that while the company had tried to localize its supply chain, it's still "very reliant on parts from across the world" for all its businesses. 1. The "sell America" trade is in full swing. On Monday, stocks, bonds, and the dollar all dropped sharply. This followed Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for taking too long to lower interest rates, which is rattling investor confidence. 2. Politically meddling with the Fed is a bad idea, top official says. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee underscored the importance of the central bank's independence on Monday. He cautioned that political interference could result in hotter inflation and higher unemployment. 3. Companies are cutting earnings outlooks. Trade war uncertainty, interest rate jitters, and recession fears are causing the revisions, which are approaching downside extremes. 1. Inside Amazon's Project Greenland. Last year, Amazon struggled to keep its retail business on track when faced with an AI chip shortage. Its response was Project Greenland: an effort to tightly approve and monitor which projects get GPU access, according to documents obtained by BI. 2. Microsoft is raising the bar. It has created new policies and tools to dial up performance pressure on employees, including a two-year rehire ban for those found to be underperforming, according to an internal email viewed by BI. 3. AI isn't ready to do your job. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University staffed a fake company with AI agents, and the results were disastrous. See the tasks AI failed the most — and where the next development phase is likely headed. 1. Are you stuck with Uber One? You're probably not alone. An FTC lawsuit accuses Uber of overpromising customers how much the paid subscription service will save them, making it too hard to cancel, and, in some cases, signing them up without consent. Uber denies the allegations. 2. Walmart's taking a page from the honeybee playbook. The retail giant is ditching zip codes for a honeycomb-style segmented map in search of speedier grocery delivery. It says the goal is to understand what customers want, where they are, and which stores have what they need. 3. How CEOs are staying calm. As uncertainty swirls over tariffs, many CEOs are turning to their wellness routines to reduce stress. Business leaders shared their tips with BI, from "purposeful scrolling" to finding balance outdoors.

Title: AMD Stock To $60?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Lisa Su, chairwoman and CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), arrives at the prime minister's ... More official residence ahead of her meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in Tokyo on April 17, 2025. (Photo by Franck ROBICHON / POOL / AFP) (Photo by FRANCK ROBICHON/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Imagine waking up to see AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) down 30%. Sounds ridiculous? It’s not. We aren’t talking about a single day drop - but sustained selling triggered by risks that are piling up leading to a big reset in valuation. If this stock reverts to anything close to a sane multiples, we’re talking a drop to $60 or even lower - and that’s without a full-blown tech meltdown. That’s the kind of risk that exists with individual stocks, or if your portfolio is too concentrated. We minimize this risk while giving exposure to upside in our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s pull back the curtain on AMD. Just from the numbers that matter, AMD looks a lot like Google at first glance. But PE multiples? Different like night and day. AMD is trading almost at 85 PE while Google is sitting below 19. Why such a massive difference? The answer: margins! AMD has a very low net margin of 6.4% compared to Google’s 28.6% (last 12 months) - which means low income and exceptionally high PE. In other words, the market is expecting significant margin expansion from AMD - but that dream might blow up. Here is what the numbers really mean. So what’s propping it up? Expectations. And those are starting to wobble. Sure, earnings might look “fine” on the surface. But watch the guidance like a hawk. That’s where the truth slips out. If AMD blinks even a little in forward guidance, Wall Street’s love affair could end fast. The semiconductor industry isn’t new to booms and busts. We’ve seen this movie before. AMD is not immune. Remember 2022? AMD dropped from $160 to under $60 in just months. And it wasn’t because AMD failed - it was because the expectations collapsed. That wasn’t the only time this happened. In 2018, AMD dropped nearly 50% in < 1.5 months as the market corrected in October. All we are saying is - stay cautious! Does it mean you shouldn’t invest in stocks like AMD? No, we aren’t saying that. AMD has provided excellent returns for investors. But stocks like AMD should be just a small part of the portfolio. There is much more to long-term money compounding. Consider Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Cuts 400 Police Department Jobs in 'State of the City'

LOS ANGELES, California — Mayor Karen Bass tried to strike an upbeat tone as she delivered the bad news Monday in her “State of the City” speech, cutting 400 civilian jobs in the L.A. Police Department next year. The Los Angeles Times reported: Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass released a proposed budget on Monday that would eliminate a nearly $1 billion financial gap by cutting more than 2,700 city positions — about 1,650 of them through layoffs. … The $14 billion spending plan, which covers the 2025-26 fiscal year, would provide funding for scores of new hires at the fire department, three months after the Palisades fire destroyed thousands of homes and killed 12 people. … At the Los Angeles Police Department, more than 400 workers would be targeted for layoffs, all of them civilians, according to figures prepared by city budget officials. The number of police officers would continue on its gradual downward trajectory, with new hires failing to keep pace with attrition. Bass also claimed that the process of recovery and building after the Palisades Fire was the fastest in the history of the state: Today, in reporting on the State of our City, I report to Los Angeles that the recovery in the Palisades is on track to be the fastest in California history. We’re not just moving fast to move fast. We know that the faster we can rebuild, the faster we can heal. We still have a long way to go, and for those who have lost a home, each and every day is a day too long. We want to be fast, we want to be safe and we want to be resilient. We have issued permits to rebuild twice as fast as after the Camp and Woolsey fires, we restored water nearly a year and a half faster than after the Camp Fire, and we restored power in just two months. Los Angeles, I assure you, rebuilding is underway. Many residents, frustrated by delays in debris removal, building permits, and insurance company payouts, would disagree. Bass said the city would start using AI technology to speed up the process of approving building permits, and called on the City Council “to pass an ordinance to waive all plan check and permit fees so that Angelenos can get home.” However, skeptical residents are running out of time. And many refuse to forget that she was out of the country when the fires broke out in January, breaking a campaign promise to refuse international travel. Joel B.

Title: Americans Believe Russian Disinformation ‘To Alarming Degree’

ByEmma Woollacott ByEmma Woollacott, Senior Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Emma Woollacott is a freelance journalist ByEmma Woollacott, Senior Contributor. View of The national flag of the Russian Federation with view of St Basil's Cathedral at sunny day ... More in Moscow, Russia A third of Americans have fallen for Russian disinformation — and for other false online claims. A national YouGov survey commissioned by news rating firm NewsGuard presented 1,000 respondents with 10 false claims that have spread widely online, including three that originated from or were mainly spread by Russian media outlets. And, the researchers found, Americans believe Kremlin disinformation to an alarming degree — along with other false claims relating to health and medicine, elections and international conflicts. Indeed, of the 10 claims presented, 78% of respondents believed at least one, and fewer than 1 in 100 managed to correctly identify all 10 claims as false. A quarter believed, for example, that up to half the U.S. aid money given to Ukraine was stolen by Ukrainian officials for personal use. More than half incorrectly thought that Ukraine sold Hamas weapons that had been donated by the U.S. Meanwhile, fewer than half of respondents correctly identified as false the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have killed between 7.3 and 15 million people worldwide, while 1 in 5 said they believed the claim to be true. The claims were made on the basis of numbers described as arbitrary by experts, and not based on any research. "The false narrative is based on an inaccurate analysis of deaths reported after Covid vaccination to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, a U.S. government database that collects unverified reports of adverse reports following vaccination," said NewsGuard. "The analysis was conducted by Edward Dowd, a former portfolio manager for investment management company BlackRock, who has no medical background and has previously made false claims about Covid-19 vaccines." Gullibility appears to cut across party lines, with respondents identifying as Democrats just as likely as Republicans to believe at least one of the 10 false claims. Republicans were, though, more likely to believe Russian disinformation claims than their Democratic counterparts, with 57.6% falling for at least one Russian disinformation claim, compared with just 17.9% of Democrats and 29.5% of people who didn't identify with one particular party. Russia is spending significant amounts on promulgating misinformation in the U.S. Last year, for example, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted two people for funneling nearly $10 million through a Tennessee-based content creation company to publish misinformation about Ukraine. And around the same time, the Justice Department seized 32 internet domains that the Russian government and Russian government-sponsored actors had been using to try and influence the 2024 elections. "An internal planning document created by the Kremlin states that a goal of the campaign is to secure Russia’s preferred outcome in the election," said then–attorney general Merrick Garland. "The sites we are seizing were filled with Russian government propaganda that had been created by the Kremlin to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies and interests, and influence voters in the United States and other countries," Garland added. All in all, said NewsGuard, Russian disinformation efforts targeting Americans continue to accelerate, and they’ve become increasingly sophisticated in recent years. "In the ongoing battle between fiction and reality, fiction—much of it created by Russia’s robust disinformation machine—appears to be winning," it warned.

Title: Stocks look to rebound as earnings roll in — but confusion still rules

Time Published: 2025-04-22T12:22:00Z

U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday, capping off a dramatic comeback fueled by hopes of easing trade tensions and a softer stance on tariffs. The Dow surged 1,017 points, or 2.7%, while the S&P 500 jumped 2.5% and the Nasdaq soared 2.7%. The Russell 2000 outpaced them all, up nearly 2.8%, signaling broad-based enthusiasm — at least for now. Volatility retreated, with the VIX dropping over 9%, and investors rotated out of safe havens. After rising to fresh highs overnight, gold fell 1.2% to $3,383 an ounce, snapping a record-setting streak even as JPMorgan (JPM-0.63%) analysts said they still see a path to $4,000 an ounce in the months ahead. Meanwhile, Bitcoin popped 5% to break above $90,000 for the first time since March, with some traders viewing crypto as a hedge against ongoing policy whiplash. Not all stocks participated in the rally. Defense contractors took a hit after earnings reports showed margin compression and rising tariff risks. Northrop Grumman plunged 12.5% — the worst performer in the S&P 500 — after reporting a steep drop in profit tied to cost overruns on the B-21 bomber program. RTX slid over 9% after warning that tariffs could slash up to $850 million from its 2025 profits. The rest of the market took a more optimistic view. Tesla gained almost 5% ahead of earnings, Netflix (NFLX+2.09%) jumped over 5%, and GE Aerospace (GE+2.38%) rallied 6% following a strong report. Still, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent scheduled to speak Wednesday on the financial system — and the political backdrop still wildly unpredictable — few believe today’s rally settles the score. Stocks climbed on Tuesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly told a private gathering that the ongoing trade war with China is “unsustainable” and likely to “de-escalate.” The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose just over 2% by late afternoon, buoyed by optimism over potential relief from steep tariffs that have weighed on global markets. However, analysts caution that the rally may be premature. Despite Bessent’s comments, there have been no formal negotiations between the U.S. and China to date, and much of social media greeted these latest deal hints with skepticism. The Trump administration’s recent tariff hikes remain in effect, including a baseline 10% tariff on all imports and additional levies pushing some Chinese goods to a 145% tariff rate. The International Monetary Fund has also weighed in, warning that the current tariff policies have delivered a significant negative shock to the global economy, prompting a downgrade in growth forecasts. While the market’s reaction reflects hope for a resolution, the situation underscores the volatility and uncertainty that continue to characterize U.S.-China trade relations. U.S. stocks rebounded strongly Tuesday after a brutal start to the week, even as investors remain rattled by a barrage of conflicting signals on recession risks — and by President Donald Trump’s escalating pressure campaign against the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,035 points, or 2.7%, while the S&P 500 also added 2.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 3%. The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, dropped almost 10%, signaling a cooldown in volatility. Gold continued its climb, up 0.4% to $3,439. The International Monetary Fund downgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2025 to 2.8%, a decrease from the previous estimate of 3.3%, citing the impact of widespread tariffs and escalating trade tensions under President Donald Trump. The U.S. economy is now projected to grow at 1.8%, down from 2.7%, with the IMF raising the probability of a U.S. recession this year to 37%, up from 25%. The IMF attributes the slowdown to increased uncertainty, reduced investment, and tighter credit conditions resulting from the tariffs, which affect nearly 60 countries. Gold extended its historic rally overnight, climbing above $3,500 for the first time. The surge likely reflects a dual concern: Investors are chasing safety amid political and market chaos, while bracing for a potential resurgence in inflation fueled by Trump’s tariffs. Last week, investors poured $8 billion into gold funds — double the peak weekly inflows seen during the pandemic — pushing the four-week average to $4 billion, according to Bank of America Global Research (BAC+2.46%). Meanwhile, traders on Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market, continue to price in elevated odds of a U.S. recession by the end of 2025. Also on Monday, the U.S. dollar plunged to a three-year low after Trump ramped up attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, intensifying calls for interest rate cuts and deepening fears over the central bank’s independence. “The market no longer knows what to believe,” wrote The Kobeissi Letter, pointing to a swirl of conflicting cues: gold rising like cuts are coming, stocks falling like a recession is near, and Treasury yields climbing like the economy is booming. Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) reports earnings after the bell on Tuesday, with Wall Street bracing for more bad news. Wells Fargo (WFC+1.74%) expects a Q1 miss, citing weak deliveries, shrinking margins, and fading enthusiasm for the Cybertruck. The firm also slashed its 2025 outlook by 16%, pointing to soft demand for the refreshed Model Y and mounting doubts around speculative bets like the Cybercab and Optimus. Tesla stock rose more than 6% in Tuesday afternoon trading after slumping on Monday. Its shares are down about 36% so far this year. Shares of Google (GOOGL+1.23%) parent Alphabet rose 3% Tuesday. The stock had slipped more than 2% on Monday after the Justice Department asked a federal judge to break up the company, possibly by forcing it to sell off its Chrome browser. Beyond Tesla, a wave of major earnings Tuesday will offer a broader pulse check on the industrial and healthcare sectors. Results from Intuitive Surgical (ISRG-0.70%), Danaher (DHR+2.50%), and Novartis (NVS+1.90%) will provide fresh reads on medical tech and pharma trends. SAP (SAP+0.45%) and Verizon (VZ+1.98%) add visibility into enterprise tech and telecom, while Chubb’s (CB+2.17%) results could shed light on how insurers are navigating a climate of rising risk and uncertainty. Defense is also in focus in a big way on Tuesday, with Lockheed Martin (LMT+0.09%), Northrop Grumman (NOC+0.38%), and RTX (RTX+0.93%) (formerly Raytheon Technologies) all reporting earings — offering investors a rare, same-day snapshot of the U.S. military-industrial complex. Together, the three giants cover everything from missile systems to fighter jet engines to battlefield surveillance, making their earnings a bellwether for how rising global tensions and Pentagon budgets are filtering into the sector.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/22/2025 5:07:58 AM PDT by ChicagoConservative27 Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) claimed Thursday on CNN’s “The Source” that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was the wrong person for his position. Kaine said, “This is a sad but very predictable situation. I think those of us on the Armed Services Committee who looked at Pete Hegseth’s material and it was voluminous before his hearing and the vote on his confirmation. Two things were plain when he was in the uniform of the United States, he served admirably, but in his leadership positions in many organizations, since his uniform service, he’s demonstrated appalling lack of judgment, both professionally and personally. And that’s why many of us, including Republicans, voted against him to be secretary of defense. And what’s happened in the last few weeks about these two Signalgate atrocities just shows the lack of judgment and that he is the wrong person to be our secretary of defense.” (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...

Title: The Hidden Costs Of Unsustainable Project Practices

Time Published: 2025-04-22T11:45:00Z
Full Content:
ByJoel Carboni ByJoel Carboni, Forbes Councils Member. Joel Carboni, President of GPM is a pioneer in advancing sustainable practices for organizations in both projects and operations. For years, businesses have viewed sustainability as a box to check—a marketing play, a feel-good initiative or something to address once all the “real” work is done. But companies that see sustainability as an added cost are missing the bigger picture. The true cost of unsustainable project management isn’t always obvious—it’s lurking in project delays, bloated budgets, supply chain disruptions, regulatory penalties and reputational damage. At its core, project management is about delivering value efficiently. And when sustainability is left out of the equation, projects can become more expensive, riskier and—quite frankly—less competitive. Here’s how the hidden costs of unsustainable project management can add up: Let’s talk numbers. Every project has a budget, but unsustainable projects often cost more than anyone initially realizes. Poor planning can lead to wasted materials, rework and inefficiencies that blow timelines and drain capital. Consider the construction industry. A developer may opt for cheaper, non-sustainable materials to cut upfront costs. But those materials often degrade faster, require costly maintenance and drive up long-term operating expenses. Suddenly, that “cost-effective” choice turns into a budget nightmare. It’s the same story in IT, infrastructure and manufacturing—any sector where short-term thinking leads to long-term waste. Take the global timber shortage in 2021. Companies that failed to anticipate rising material costs and over-relied on non-renewable sources saw their manufacturing expenses skyrocket. Meanwhile, competitors with sustainable sourcing strategies were able to adapt without breaking stride. And then there’s Carillion, the U.K. construction giant that collapsed in 2018. A major factor? A reckless approach to project management—unsustainable contracts, poor risk assessment and wasteful spending that ultimately led to bankruptcy and government intervention. The potential cost of ignoring sustainability: Budget overruns, excessive waste and a never-ending cycle of rework and maintenance costs. Regulations around sustainability aren’t getting looser—they’re getting stricter. Governments worldwide are cracking down on emissions, waste management, labor practices and corporate ESG disclosures. And when businesses don’t take sustainability seriously, they don’t just risk a slap on the wrist—they could face fines, lawsuits and potential shutdowns. Take Volkswagen’s diesel scandal. The automaker rigged emissions tests to make its vehicles appear more eco-friendly. The result? Over $30 billion in fines, lawsuits and vehicle buybacks. Or look at Boeing’s 737 MAX disaster. At its root, it was a failure in ethical project management. Cutting corners on safety led to two fatal crashes, a worldwide grounding of aircraft and billions in fines and lost revenue. Businesses that ignore sustainability aren’t just rolling the dice with their reputation—they’re gambling with their financial future. And in today’s regulatory climate, that’s a bet no one should be taking. The potential cost of non-compliance: Regulatory fines, lawsuits and business disruptions that eat into the bottom line. Reputation isn’t just about good PR—it’s about trust. And in a world where consumers and investors are paying attention, companies that fake sustainability get exposed fast. Fast fashion brands, such as H&M, have been called out for greenwashing, making big sustainability claims with little action to back them up. The backlash isn’t just social media noise—it hits revenue hard. Today’s consumers have options, and they’re choosing brands that actually walk the talk. Investors are doing the same, directing capital away from companies with weak ESG commitments. Even BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has made it clear: "We focus on sustainability not because we’re environmentalists, but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients." The potential cost of a bad reputation: Loss of consumer trust, declining stock value and long-term brand damage. The next generation of workers aren't just looking for a paycheck. They want purpose. And if companies don’t offer it, they’ll go somewhere that does. A 2024 Deloitte study found that a company’s sustainability efforts influences employees' career-related decisions. And if leadership doesn’t take sustainability seriously? Employees are walking. Google saw this firsthand in 2019 when thousands of employees staged a walkout in protest of the company’s deals with fossil fuel firms. The message was clear: Sustainability isn’t just about corporate responsibility—it’s an employee demand, too. The potential cost of ignoring talent: Higher turnover, recruitment struggles and a disengaged workforce. Companies that fail to prioritize sustainability in their supply chain set themselves up for failure. Just look at the 2021 global semiconductor shortage—a crisis that crippled industries from automotive to consumer tech. Companies that didn’t diversify their suppliers or invest in sustainable sourcing strategies were left scrambling. And climate-related disruptions? They’re only getting worse. According to the World Economic Forum, droughts, floods and wildfires are impacting everything from food production to raw material sourcing. Businesses that ignore these risks face increased costs and supply chain bottlenecks. The potential cost of a weak supply chain: Delays, rising costs and loss of market competitiveness. In closing, sustainability shouldn't be viewed as a cost, but rather as a competitive advantage. Companies that embed sustainability into their project management practices aren’t just doing the right thing—they’re setting themselves up for long-term profitability, risk resilience and competitive differentiation. In a rapidly evolving market, sustainability isn’t just about compliance or reputation—it’s about staying ahead of industry shifts and future-proofing operations against emerging challenges. Sustainability can reduce financial waste, lower legal risks, strengthen brand reputation, attract top talent and fortify supply chains against disruption. It creates operational efficiencies, drives innovation and enhances customer loyalty in ways that short-term cost-cutting never will. Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?

Title: EV battery maker Northvolt failed after blowing through $15 billion. This US rival thinks it won't suffer the same fate.

Time Published: 2025-04-22T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
When Northvolt went bankrupt, it sent shockwaves through the cleantech industry. Backed by big names such as Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, the Swedish startup had set out to revolutionize electric vehicle battery production — not just recycling them but also making new ones. Redwood Materials, a US rival run by Tesla's cofounder JB Straubel, is trying to tackle the same problem without succumbing to overambition. To do that, it focuses on upstream materials, maintains strategic partnerships, and avoids direct competition with customers. Northvolt's vision was as audacious as it was complex. With $15 billion in funding, the company planned to handle everything in-house: sourcing raw materials, recycling batteries into black mass (a powder rich in nickel, lithium, cobalt, and manganese), refining that material via hydrometallurgy, and then producing battery cells at a massive scale. With that scope came massive risk. Building and scaling cell manufacturing — especially outside Asia — is notoriously difficult. Northvolt struggled to ramp up operations at its Arctic Circle facility and increasingly relied on Chinese equipment, which slowed production and created bottlenecks. Costs ballooned, debts mounted, and the company ultimately couldn't keep up. "Northvolt went a little too fast," an investor who has backed startups in this industry said. "They tried to commercialize before perfecting the process at scale." This person asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters. Northvolt did not respond to a request for comment. Redwood Materials, by contrast, focuses on what it sees as the most valuable — and underinvested — piece of the EV battery supply chain: cathode active materials. CAMs account for roughly 60% of a battery's value and 15% of an electric vehicle's cost, Redwood says. There's no large-scale CAM production in North America, and that's the gap Redwood wants to fill. "We're not making battery cells. That's never been part of the plan," Cal Lankton, Redwood's chief commercial officer, said. "We don't want to compete with our customers." Instead, Redwood recycles EV battery production scrap and old batteries into usable metals and refines them into CAMs, which it sells to cell manufacturers such as Panasonic and Toyota. This strategy keeps the company neutral, while generating revenue from multiple points in the supply chain. "As JB would say, we can be Switzerland," Lankton told me when I met him recently at Redwood's campus in Nevada's high desert. Unlike Northvolt, which produced its own batteries and used its recycled material internally, Redwood aims to sell its refined materials to a wide variety of customers, reducing dependency on any one player and avoiding direct competition with partners that make batteries. "What Northvolt set out to build is incredibly impressive — the scope, the aspiration of what they tried to do," Lankton said. "I don't want to come across at all as denigrating what happened." But he said that by trying to make batteries itself, Northvolt added extra layers of risk, complexity, and expense. "You're competing with your customers. So you would only produce CAM for your own consumption, which was Northvolt's plan, right?" Lankton added. "So if any piece in there falls apart, the whole thing breaks." Redwood has also been more measured in its scaling. While Northvolt attempted to go from lab to commercial production in one giant leap, Redwood moves step-by-step — refining materials, building CAM capacity, and taking on new challenges only when it's ready. For example, Lankton said that while Redwood initially intended to hold onto intermediate recycled materials until its CAM operations ramped up, the company made a tactical pivot: Sell the intermediate products now, generate revenue, and prove its capabilities. "A dollar today for a company in our position is much more valuable than a dollar to use in the future," Lankton said. "Let's convert that inventory into cash. Let's demonstrate our capability to our investors, to our customers, to the market." Redwood also used to make copper foil, a main ingredient in batteries. When Chinese companies began churning this out in massive quantities, prices plummeted, so Redwood halted that part of its business. "We're not dogmatic," Lankton said. "We're not going to take a business plan and just do it until we think it works and run ourselves into the ground." Northvolt's bankruptcy isn't just a cautionary tale — it's a live case study. The company's downfall underscores the perils of overintegration, overreach, and underestimating the difficulty of battery cell manufacturing. Redwood Materials is learning and taking a different tack by positioning itself not as a battery maker but as an enabler of the EV battery supply chain. "I think that's one of the strengths of Redwood, and I — again, not to put too fine a point on it, something that Northvolt kind of struggled with, which is finding those pivot points when the original plan perhaps is getting more expensive or further out in the future," Lankton said.

A Huawei store in Beijing, 2024. America’s political and economic elites were once unruffled by the rise of China. Yes, Chinese GDP was growing fast, and yes, China’s share of global trade was growing equally rapidly. But this did not—or, at least, did not seem to—challenge America’s ongoing economic dominance. After all, the dollar was still king. The size and depth of China’s stock market continued to be dwarfed by the United States’. GDP per capita still weighed heavily in America’s favor. And the acknowledged global heavyweights of Big Tech—Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft—were American companies one and all. The basic posture vis-à-vis China was the following: You keep producing all that cheap stuff, we’ll keep on buying it, and you keep on financing the deficits that we accrue in the process. Over the last decade, all of this has unraveled. During his first term in the White House, Donald Trump introduced a series of tariffs on Chinese imports, which sparked retaliatory measures from China and growing talk of a “trade war.” Under Joe Biden, the inflammatory language of the Trump 1.0 era became less conspicuous. Rather, in a break with the hegemony of neoliberalism, the Biden White House hailed a renaissance in “industrial policy”; his flacks talked about no longer being able to rely on market mechanisms to guide investment. But even if the tone had changed, the policy content was not much different: China was in the crosshairs. If anything, Biden’s China tariffs were more severe than those he inherited. In mid-2024, tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum were raised to 25 percent, on solar cells and panels to 50 percent, on electric vehicles to 100 percent; and in a parting gift to his successor, in January 2025, just as Biden was leaving office, a 50 percent tariff on Chinese semiconductors went into effect. Notably, green technology was at the heart of Biden’s trade and China policy. In explaining his tariff hikes and their sectoral concentration, the Biden team repeatedly invoked the climate crisis and the energy transition, arguing that the only successful and sustainable global transition would be one where green technologies were not monopolized by a single country. US officials were well aware that monopolization was something that China was close to actually achieving. By 2023, China controlled the production of around 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth elements used in clean-energy products and at least 80 percent of the global solar-panel supply chain, with only slightly lower shares in wind turbines and EV batteries. Washington also looked with something like awe at China’s build-out of solar and wind power: The year after Biden’s historic “climate bill,” the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, was passed to great domestic fanfare, China installed 10 times as much net new renewable capacity as America did. Under Trump 2.0, all emphasis on green technology has of course been buried (at least rhetorically, since the tariffs on China’s green tech were retained). But the tariff saber-rattling has nonetheless escalated into all-out trade warfare. In February, a 10 percent tariff was imposed on Chinese imports across the board, and in March, this was increased to 20 percent. Trump was just getting started, however: April 2, his “Liberation Day,” saw the blanket tariff rate on China raised to 54 percent; and at the time of this writing, after retaliatory Chinese measures, the US tariff rate on Chinese imports effectively totals 145 percent. What is increasingly clear is that after decades of cautious sparring, the rivalry between America and China—as the US regards it, at any rate—has become a battle for global economic supremacy. Certainly, the Trump administration has targeted many other countries too, but China is plainly the main antagonist. Not for nothing has the Chinese government accused the United States of “unilateral bullying.” What is also clear, though, is that underneath America’s bluster lurks a very real and very understandable fear: namely, that this is a battle that America might not win. In fact, more than that, this is a battle that America might have already lost; all the joking on social media that the United States has entered its own “Century of Humiliation”— China’s lasted from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century—cuts to the quick precisely because it expresses very real anxieties. If one company symbolizes the ongoing struggle between America and China, that company, arguably, is Huawei. In its early years, after it was founded in 1987, Huawei—a Chinese tech firm that focuses on telecommunications—was largely ignored in the US, to the extent that it was even acknowledged. In the 2000s and early 2010s, as the company grew and expanded, including in the United States itself, American business and policy elites generally tolerated Huawei, perceiving it, at worst, as an irritant. But since Trump’s first term as president, a new era has begun. Endlessly challenged and vitriolically attacked, Huawei has ascended to the status of Public Enemy No. 1, the very apotheosis of the Chinese “threat.” So why is Huawei treated with such hostility by US policymakers? Partly it’s about geopolitics. Though Huawei is an increasingly diversified enterprise, its main business, generating over half of total revenue, is the design, manufacture, and sale of telecom equipment such as networking infrastructure and the provision of ancillary services. Communications networks, of course, are integral to the ways in which states eavesdrop and spy on one another. America’s fear is that Huawei could or already does allow its products to be used to nefarious ends by the Chinese government. Ergo, it is deemed a threat to US national security. It is with this aspect of Huawei’s role in US-China relations that Eva Dou, a reporter for The Washington Post, is principally concerned in her new book, House of Huawei: The Secret History of China’s Most Powerful Company. It has never been a secret that Huawei’s technologies are widely embedded in the contemporary surveillance state. The company has, for instance, been a major player since the 2000s in the international market for the chips used in surveillance cameras; Huawei was one of eight companies selected by Beijing in 1996 for a $1 billion national semiconductor development program. In China itself, what proved an especially lucrative opportunity for Huawei was President Xi Jinping’s launch in 2015 of a program—dubbed “Sharp Eyes”—aimed, Dou writes, at “blanketing the country with a network of security cameras.” In 2020, it was announced that China’s capital had no more blind spots: “Electronic eyes were watching over 100 percent of Beijing.” The same year, the Post revealed that Huawei had knowingly countenanced the use of its technology to track members of the Uyghur ethnic minority, prompting the French soccer star Antoine Griezmann to terminate his sponsorship deal with the company. While the Uyghur revelations certainly hardened what by that point was a growing US-led international turn against Huawei, policymakers in America and other Western markets have always been much more concerned about the security-related and political implications of Huawei’s presence in their own territories. Could Huawei’s gear be hacked, leading to network disruption? Could the Chinese government listen in on international network users? From the American perspective, the biographic details of Huawei’s legendary founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei—a background in the military (the Engineering Corps) and a member of the Chinese Communist Party since 1978—only redoubled the grounds for suspicion. “With Huawei increasingly integrated into global networks,” Dou writes of developments in the mid-2000s, “it was being watched closely by spy agencies.” Statements along these lines pepper the book; by the end, the reader may wonder why Dou spends quite so much time on the cloak-and-dagger stuff, given that she never does unearth a smoking gun of any kind. Nonetheless, she is quite right to highlight the staggering hypocrisy of the US government’s moral grandstanding about alleged Chinese espionage machinations. As the 2013–14 Snowden leaks demonstrated, America’s own National Security Agency had successfully infiltrated Huawei several years previously and was using its infrastructure to spy not just on the company but on a range of other public- and private-sector entities, both in China and around the world. “The irony,” as Huawei’s US spokesman, William Plummer, put it at the time, “is that exactly what they are doing to us is what they have always charged that the Chinese are doing through us.” No wonder, remarks Dou, that Washington had been “so confident that Beijing could use Huawei’s gear for snooping: the NSA had been doing exactly that for years.” For all the security concerns, however, the fact that Huawei is regarded as such a threat has to do with much more than “just” geopolitics. Equally important, and perhaps even more so, is the brute fact of Huawei’s staggering commercial success. One suspects that, consciously or otherwise, anxiety about Huawei’s competitive accomplishments is sometimes dressed up as a concern with “safety”: Far easier for the American mind to invoke a surveillance bogeyman than to admit to trepidatious reverence at Chinese business prowess. As late as the turn of the millennium, the international telecommunications hardware market—Huawei’s home turf—continued to be dominated by Western firms such as Alcatel, Ericsson, Lucent, and Nortel. But the first decade of the new millennium began to see a changing of the guard. A seminal moment, as Dou tells it, came with Huawei’s first major breakthrough in the West, when, in 2005, the company won a lucrative bid to upgrade the network of BT, Britain’s largest supplier of telephony services. Opening the door to, among others, the French and Spanish markets, the BT deal was the “beginning of the end for several of Huawei’s Western rivals,” who simply couldn’t compete with the company at its “budget price points.” By 2012, Huawei was the world’s largest vendor of telecommunications networking hardware. Having also successfully made the move into consumer electronics—branded household gadgets “could help Huawei soften its image overseas,” Dou notes—the Chinese firm was, for good measure, now the world’s third-largest smartphone maker, behind only Apple and Samsung. Sophie Lewis Elie Mystal Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers Elie Mystal Huawei has succeeded internationally despite America’s best efforts, especially in the past decade, to prevent it from doing so. The company had been on Washington’s radar since the late 1990s, not least because of its expansion in those years into markets presided over by what the US deemed “rogue” regimes, among them Iraq and Russia. The result was that, even after Huawei successfully made big sales in other Western territories after establishing its foothold in Britain, America would remain the one major market in which it failed to make significant inroads, having to satisfy itself there with sales to second- or third-tier network operators. As a potential supplier, the Chinese company was simply beyond the pale for America’s telephony market leaders, for whom political optics and relationships are considered just as important as capital costs and network quality. During the first Trump administration, the US expanded its campaign against Huawei on two new fronts. It imposed export controls, specifically by banning US companies from supplying Huawei with critical components, as they had been doing since as early as 1993, when Huawei established its first US subsidiary in California. And, with some notable successes, the US government also began applying substantial pressure on countries like Australia, Britain, and Canada to follow its lead in blackballing Huawei in their domestic markets, focusing on those countries’ tendering of contracts to build 5G networks. Huawei, however, has prevailed nonetheless, even as there is no doubt that America’s resistance has crimped the scope of its achievements. “The West was continuing to grow more inhospitable toward Huawei,” Dou says by way of bringing her story up to the time of her writing, in 2024. “Yet—almost incredibly—Huawei was still number one in the world in 5G gear sales.” Huawei’s prevailing in the face of the United States’ concerted opposition shows that America is not as powerful or persuasive as it certainly likes to imagine that it is: Not everyone, even its (erstwhile) “friends,” kowtows to its demands. Furthermore, and perhaps more significantly still, the Huawei story demonstrates that in the 21st century, non-Western companies are able to be enormous commercial successes—to be, in fact, world leaders in their chosen industry sectors—while having the US and several other leading Western markets essentially closed off to them. That, in itself, is a profound statement on the shifting of the world economic order, and one that Trump and his cronies evidently seem to be ignoring—or perhaps are unable to understand—as they set about alienating long-time commercial and political allies, in addition to the list of long-time adversaries, by unleashing an all-encompassing trade war the likes of which the world has not seen since the early 20th century. In the postwar era, it would have been unthinkable that a company could have ascended to global market leadership in any area of the economy without a major presence in the United States, Europe, or (more likely) both. That is no longer true. Alongside East Asia and Africa, it is the Middle East, with all its natural-resource-based riches, that represents, in Dou’s words, “the beating heart of Huawei’s global empire.” What is also maddening to Huawei’s American critics is that it has done all this while thumbing its nose at American-style capitalism. For many years, there was widespread expectation around the world, and among many in China itself, that Huawei would proceed to an IPO. This was assumed to be its “natural” evolutionary terminus, the inevitable result of the company’s inculcating, and eventually adopting, the Western gospel of shareholder value. But Huawei never did become a public company, and it never prioritized shareholder value to the exclusion of all else. It was, and is, something else entirely—and that something else has proved a great commercial success. What do we know about the model? Huawei began life as a contract manufacturer. That is, at the start, it did not have its own products, but manufactured those of others—including, most notably, simple analog telephone switches capable of routing and connecting, at most, a few dozen phone calls, which were sold to the likes of small offices and hotels. Huawei was initially a private company, controlled top to bottom by Ren Zhengfei himself and capitalized with the princely sum of 21,000 yuan provided by Ren and five private investors. Five years after its founding, by which time it had developed and begun to sell a first switch of its own (the BH-03), Huawei converted in 1992 to a “collectively owned enterprise,” a company structure that furnished both a degree of political patronage and a set of broader financing opportunities—and which, in Huawei’s case, appeared to entail a more democratic form of management in the shape, in particular, of a powerful workers’ committee. A stimulus for further change came in 1994, a landmark year for China’s corporate landscape, when the country’s new Company Law introduced limited-liability companies (LLCs) with the aims of encouraging greater investment, aligning China’s corporate governance with international standards, and facilitating an accelerated transition to a market economy. Ren was intrigued but not immediately convinced, electing to hire a team of Beijing business professors to help him strategize restructuring opportunities and map out a new future for the firm. Huawei did become an LLC (and remains one today), but only in 1997, at which point the existing employee shareholdings, of which there were a large number, were consolidated into a single “trade union” holding. Meanwhile, the professors’ much-anticipated blueprint, the “Huawei Basic Law,” was adopted the following year. Profit would be just one objective among many; more important was the reinvestment of that profit to drive growth—fully 10 percent of sales were to go into R&D. Dou argues that Huawei is ultimately best understood as a company made in the image of the nation. Its goal is not to increase shareholder value so much as “to ensure its own long-term survival,” as is also true, she points out, of the ruling Communist Party. The secret of Huawei’s success, Dou writes, is its “ability to accomplish titanic tasks at almost impossible speeds by getting everyone to pull in unison.” Reading these words, one can’t help but think, yet again, of China’s titanic ongoing achievements in rolling out renewable energy capacity on a gargantuan scale and at almost impossible speeds. But Dou is also forthright about the considerable downsides of this business approach. Success achieved in the manner of Huawei, she observes, “can come at crushing costs for the individuals involved.” Huawei “fetishized long work hours”—the company’s engineers were accustomed to keeping mats by their desks so they could nap on the floor rather than going home at night. Perhaps worse was that an aggressive, survival-of-the-fittest “wolf culture” was encouraged not just externally, in the rivalry with competitors, but internally, among colleagues. And it surely did not help employees’ mental health to know that the prospect of involuntary redundancy constantly hovered in the background: Huawei, Dou notes, “repeatedly pressured its staff into mass resignations.” In any case, enough is known about the psychological effects to leave the reader in no doubt about the sheer corrosiveness of the Huawei model from a social perspective. Dou reports a “string of ‘unnatural’ deaths,” including suicides, among employees. She also cites the finding of a scholarly study that some two-thirds of Huawei’s senior management were suffering from a stress-related illness. Such figures hint at a milieu beside which even Wall Street’s famously pitiless working culture would likely look positively tranquil. Huawei is a creature of Shenzhen, a city in the coastal province of Guangdong in South China. After the decommissioning of his military unit, the Engineering Corps, a thirtysomething Ren Zhengfei moved to Shenzhen in the early 1980s, initially assigned a job there at a subsidiary of the state-owned South Sea Oil Corporation, which was building a harbor to support offshore oil production. Following a “short and undistinguished” time in this position, Ren—who had made something of a name for himself in the military by building a precision air-pressure generator that he subsequently worked to commercialize—established Huawei. He was 42. He is still the company’s CEO today. It is possible, perhaps even probable, that Huawei could not have become what it did except in Shenzhen. Abutting Hong Kong to its immediate south, Shenzhen was designated as China’s first-ever “special economic zone” in 1980. At the time, it had a population of around 30,000. Physically walled off from the rest of China by barbed-wire fences, it was also walled off figuratively: While the post-Mao reformism of Deng Xiaoping initially proceeded slowly in the country at large, everything was on fast forward in the “wild west” that was late-20th-century Shenzhen, where the normal rules did not apply and an “anything goes” approach prevailed. The city was “ground zero,” Dou writes, for China’s “grand experiment with capitalism.” Ren and Huawei exploited this business environment maximally, as did many others. In the 1980s through the 2010s, Shenzhen was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world: By 2020, its 30,000 inhabitants had become 17.4 million, making the city by then China’s third-largest. Of course, the Chinese “capitalism” with which Ren and others experimented in booming Shenzhen was and is a very special version, and Dou does a wonderful job of picturing its sheer foreignness and oddness, when seen through Western eyes. In no respect, perhaps, is the foreignness of Chinese capitalism more striking than in terms of the relation between firms and the Chinese Communist Party. All companies with a certain proportion of employees who are party members are required to establish an internal party “committee” that gives the CCP a formal role in the company. Huawei set up its committee in 1996, with Ren himself serving as the first secretary. Huawei’s committee infused the company with the CCP’s signature themes of “patriotism, struggle for the greater cause, and self-sacrifice”—no doubt the mats by the engineers’ desks and the surging mental health problems were justified accordingly—and its influence appears only to have grown with time. In 2007, the committee was granted veto power over Huawei’s executive appointments. Indeed, as Western observers have never tired of remarking, Huawei’s fortunes were bound up with the party, and with the state more generally, from the start. The mistake that those observers have made, however, is to think about the Chinese state primarily, and sometimes only, in terms of Beijing, which is to say the central government. To do so, Dou shows us, is to miss one of the most important parts of the Huawei story. The specific products that were key to making Huawei a major commercial force both nationally and internationally were digital telephone switches. Able to route and connect thousands (or even millions) of calls at once compared with the mere dozens handled by analog versions, digital switches constitute the nerve centers of modern public communications networks, directing and managing the flow of data as well as voice packets. When Huawei began working in the early 1990s on the development of digital switches, that work was financed by a joint-venture company called Mobeco, established in 1993. The money behind Mobeco was provided by Huawei’s equity partners in the venture—namely, 17 provincial and municipal (that is, public) telecom bureaus. When Huawei’s first proprietary digital switch (C&C08) went into production in 1995, the same public telecom bureaus that had helped finance its development were now in charge of buying it for their local telephone exchanges. Not only that, but, indirectly at least, they also found themselves manufacturing it: Huawei outsourced the production of C&C08 to Mobeco. In short, what Western observers might understand as conflicts of interest abounded. And Huawei then doubled down, as the success of Mobeco prompted it to expand the model: It set up more such joint ventures with local governments around the country. Dou characterizes these as “Huawei’s ‘marriage’ to the state.” This is not to say that Huawei didn’t have close and efficacious relationships with other arms of the state—for example, “in 2005,” Dou writes, “the China Development Bank, a Beijing-controlled policy bank, allocated a whopping $10 billion to fund Huawei’s overseas expansion.” Despite documenting these various linkages between the company and the state, this is also, paradoxically, where House of Huawei is at its weakest. As Dou observes, amid the 1990s ferment of productive innovation in China, Huawei was one of four major domestic producers of telecom equipment to come to the fore, the others being Datang, Great Dragon, and ZTE. Why, out of these four, did Huawei emerge as the undisputed leader both domestically and, ultimately, internationally? Dou doesn’t—and arguably can’t—answer that question, because despite hinting that Huawei won simply by virtue of outcompeting its rivals, she never actually gets at the question of what “competition” means in the context of Chinese capitalism, saturated as that system is in political influence. Scholars, however, have been exploring this question. The sociologist Kyle Chan, for instance, has examined the nature of competition in sectors of the Chinese economy in which state-owned enterprises (SOEs) play a significant role. His research is highly relevant to the case at hand: Datang, Great Dragon, and ZTE are all owned wholly or mainly by the state. Chan found that industries with a substantial SOE presence, telecommunications included, are characterized by what he calls “managed competition,” representing a blend of state oversight and competitive forces and combining innovation and efficiency, on the one hand, with control and planning on the other. In order to maintain a balance of competitive capabilities among industry actors and thus prevent the formation of monopolies, the state intervenes where necessary, Chan argues, to redistribute resources, personnel, and contracts. There is very little analysis of this kind in House of Huawei. Dou has written a book that is much more interested in personalities, subterfuge, and geopolitics than it is in economics and competitive practice. She helps us understand why Huawei vaulted to the top of US policymakers’ fearful protectionist agenda, but less about how and why it vaulted to the top of the telecommunications industry against both national and international competitors. We are left with much still to understand about Huawei as a particular corporate embodiment of what is, in the Chinese case, a very particular type of capitalist social formation. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

Title: Crypto Firms Circle And BitGo Set To Pursue US Bank Licenses, WSJ

Crypto is reportedly becoming more integrated into the conventional banking system, according to the Wall Street Journal. This shift occurs after the regulatory crackdown that followed the failure of crypto exchange FTX and its aftermath for many crypto-friendly institutions caused many in the conventional financial sector to withdraw their support from the digital asset market. But now, with Trump’s recent vow to make America a “Bitcoin superpower,” things might be starting to change, the report alleges, and more integration between crypto and conventional banking could be on the horizon. Several crypto firms, including Circle and BitGo, are reportedly planning to apply for banking charters or licenses. Notably, Coinbase Global and the stablecoin company Paxos are also considering similar steps. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Trump administration aims to mainstream crypto finances, as such, Congress is advancing legislation that would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. These proposed regulations would require stablecoin issuers to obtain charters or licenses from regulators, a move that could fundamentally change the operational dynamics of the digital asset market. Many firms are exploring options for national trust or industrial bank charters, which would allow them to function similarly to conventional banks by accepting deposits and making loans. Others are reportedly pursuing more specialized licenses that would enable them to issue stablecoins. Any firm that secures a banking charter will face stricter oversight, a reality that has been vividly illustrated by Anchorage Digital, the only digital asset firm in the US to hold a federal bank charter. CEO Nathan McCauley told the Wall Street Journal that the company has invested tens of millions of dollars to meet regulatory obligations, which include stringent anti-money-laundering measures. Anchorage’s recent partnership with major financial players, including BlackRock and Cantor Fitzgerald, underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets within mainstream finance. Just a few years ago, major banks severed ties with crypto firms amid a wave of regulatory scrutiny following the FTX incident. The fallout from the collapse of Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank left many crypto entrepreneurs struggling to find banking partners willing to accept their deposits or provide loans. However, the political climate is shifting, and under Trump’s administration, regulators have begun to relax restrictions that previously required banks to obtain approval for crypto-related activities. New guidance on how banks can engage with crypto is anticipated later this year. Some banks are eager to catch up and establish partnerships within the crypto space. For instance, Bank of America’s CEO Brian Moynihan expressed interest in issuing a stablecoin, contingent upon a solid legal framework. Similarly, US Bancorp recently announced plans to relaunch its digital asset custody service in collaboration with NYDIG, a Bitcoin trading and banking firm. Conversely, some banks remain cautious. KeyCorp’s CEO Chris Gorman acknowledged the potential risks posed by digital assets, viewing them as both an opportunity and a competitive threat. Gorman emphasized the importance of understanding the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly concerning anti-money-laundering safeguards.

On the surface, all seems hunky dory. The Ireland men’s team are ranked third in the world, the ever-improving women’s side are ranked fifth and Leinster are one more home semi-final win away from becoming the first side ever to reach four successive Champions Cup finals. Scratch underneath, though, and the gap between Leinster and the other three provinces has never been bigger, nor more alarming. For sure, there is nothing particularly new in Leinster being the last Irish team standing in Europe. They have been the only Irish team in the semi-final stages of the Champions Cup for six seasons in a row now, while Ulster haven’t been in a final for 13 years and Munster for 17 seasons. However, it’s not just that the other three provinces are so far away from dining at European rugby’s top table, it’s that there is no sign of this changing any time soon. Furthermore, take the URC, a competition which the Irish teams used to routinely dominate. Two seasons ago, Leinster, Ulster, Munster and Connacht all reached the playoffs. The latter three, on average, had a 61 per cent winning ratio that season. This season, as things stand, Munster, Ulster and Connacht have all lost more matches than they have won. Between them, the trio’s winning ratio has dropped to 42 per cent. Munster sit seventh, Ulster 10th and Connacht 12th, and there is a real possibility that Leinster might be the only Irish team in the playoffs and hence the only Irish team in next season’s Champions Cup, with the other three consigned to the Challenge Cup. It shouldn’t come to that. The others are still in the mix, but then again it might come to that. This cannot be solely attributable to the arrival of the South African teams. After all, they were there two seasons ago. Throw in the provinces’ respective Champions Cup and Challenge Cup games this season and whereas Leinster’s winning ratio is 95 per cent, for the three others combined this figure is 45 per cent. This is truly alarming. But then again this is the inevitable byproduct of the increasing centralisation of the Irish system and its focus on international teams, be they 15s or Sevens, during the tenure of David Nucifora as the IRFU performance director. And it could take many years to rectify the problem. The IRFU invest equally in the pathways of all four provinces but they are not receiving much in return from Munster, Ulster and Connacht, although the Union’s focus on Provincial Talent Squads and National Talent Squads seems only to have shrunk the base designed to develop international quality players. Next season there will be 14 centrally contracted players, of whom four came from the pathways in New Zealand (Bundee Aki, James Lowe and Jamison Gibson-Park) and Australia (Mack Hansen). Connacht can rightly lay claim to Robbie Henshaw, but the other nine, including Munster’s only centrally contracted player, Tadhg Beirne, came through the Leinster pathway. Not one player came through Munster or Ulster, and the latter do not have one centrally contracted player next season. Last week’s announcement by the IRFU that the provinces are to be responsible for 40 per cent of national player contracts where previously the figure had been set at 30 per cent is a step in the right direction. It is estimated that this will free up around €500-€600,000 for the IRFU to redistribute toward improving the pathways in Connacht, Munster and Ulster. One sincerely hopes that these monies are used to upgrade the yawning gulf in facilities and coaching which exists between the elite rugby-playing schools in Leinster compared to the other three provinces. As well as having this and other socio-economic advantages, true to type Leinster were also quicker out of the blocks in breaking into their own schools. As with the other provinces, schools rugby had been something of an impenetrable sacred cow, but teachers – under heightened pressure academically – don’t have the time for coaching which they once had. So, maybe the other three provinces should stop trying to emulate the Leinster system and focus their energies and player development on their clubs. For it’s hard to see how the Cork, Limerick, Galway and Belfast schools will ever match the facilities and coaching budgets of St Michael’s, Blackrock et al. The IRFU have done many things right, eventually, in the professional era but in investing more heavily on Ireland international teams they have taken their eye off the provinces. And although Team Ireland should be strong for another few years yet, the chickens are already coming home to roost. Remember the 90s? Team Ireland could hardly buy a win. That was partly because the same was true of all four provinces in the early days of professionalism and the European Cup. Then came Ulster’s 1999 European Cup triumph and, in particular, Munster’s emergence in the noughties to reach four finals, winning two of them in 2006 and 2008. This was followed by Leinster’s arrival among European rugby’s true elite, which provided the players with the confidence to establish Ireland as one of the best sides in the world. Viewed in that light, Leinster’s excellence should be celebrated. Where Irish rugby would be without them really doesn’t bear thinking about. That’s why the stellar signings of the last 12 months, and the IRFU sanctioning the arrival of Rieko Ioane, are positives. Leinster winning the Champions Cup would be brilliant for Irish rugby. Rather than close the gap by diluting Leinster in any way, the Union need to strengthen the other three. The restructuring of the Union’s funding model last week is presumably with this ideal in mind and followed ‘a planned review of its funding model’. Hence it had been in the pipeline for a year or so, and it will take many years for it to bear fruit. The likelihood is that much of the investment in Under-20s and Sevens programmes will also be redirected towards the other three provinces. But it is already clear that while this is a step in the right direction, it is most likely a drop in the ocean and not nearly enough to address the underlining and alarming fault lines which have emerged in Irish rugby. gerry.thornley@irishtimes.com Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wall Street Journal: Trump's Less Border Migration Allows More Airport Migration

President Donald Trump has successfully stopped the inflow of economic migrants via the southern border, so he should invite more economic migrants via the nation’s airports, says the Wall Street Journal. The political “question is whether Mr. Trump can use the political capital from his border victory to achieve a more lasting immigration success,” the newspaper’s pro-migration editors declared. According to WSJ-owner Rupert Murdoch’s editors, Trump’s “opportunity” for “immigration success” should: include more pathways for legal immigration to address the labor needs of a growing economy. Half of small businesses say one of their largest problems is finding workers. If Mr. Trump wants more fruits and vegetables grown at home, who’s going to pick them? … If Mr. Trump wants Silicon Valley to win the AI race, why are H-1B skilled visas capped at a low number and handed out by lottery? The newspaper’s illegal=bad/legal=good message comes as Trump’s deputies are charting a course back to a lower-migration, high-productivity United States, away from the post-1990 cheap-labor economy that transfers ordinary Americans’ wages into profits for quarterly CEOs and Wall Street investors. The promise of cheap labor is “a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told his audience of investors in March: Real innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think, dignifies our workers. It boosts our standard of living. It strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor. Breitbart News has posted many articles about migration’s harmful impact on productivity and innovation — and also how tight labor markets help pressure companies to invest in wage-boosting automation and productivity. In the white-collar sector, Breitbart News has shown how visa programs created by Congress and executives — such as the H-1B, J-1, L-1, CPT, and other visa programs — have imported debilitating Indian-style office politics into a wide range of critical U.S. companies, including Intel, IBM, Twitter, and Boeing. The damage was recently spotlighted by Citibank, which announced it would sharply reduce its reliance on foreign contractors after the contractors cost the company at least $600 million in routine operations and regulatory incompetence. The decision means Citibank will begin hiring at least 10,000 American technology professionals for jobs held by supposedly cheaper Indian visa workers. The economic damage of migration has been noted by some business leaders who face competing temptations to either raise short-term profit via migration or raise long-term productivity and innovation via investment in American employees. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” Fink said.

Title: Wall Street and the dollar tumble as investors retreat further from the United States

All rights reserved Trader Sal Suarino works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, April 21, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Wall Street weakened Monday as investors worldwide get more skeptical about U.S. investments because of President Donald Trump’s trade war and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which are shaking the traditional order. The S&P 500 sank 2.4% in another wipeout. That yanked the index that’s at the center of many 401(k) accounts 16% below its record set two months ago. Recommended Videos The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971 points, or 2.5%, while losses for Tesla and Nvidia helped drag the Nasdaq composite down 2.6%. Perhaps more worryingly, U.S. government bonds and the value of the U.S. dollar also sank as prices retreated across U.S. markets. It’s an unusual move because Treasurys and the dollar have historically strengthened during episodes of nervousness. This time around, though, it’s policies directly from Washington that are causing the fear and potentially weakening their reputations as some of the world’s safest investments. Trump continued his tough talk on global trade as economists and investors continue to say his stiff proposed tariffs could cause a recession if they’re not rolled back. U.S. talks last week with Japan failed to reach a quick deal that could lower tariffs and protect the economy, and they’re seen as a “test case,” according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. “The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules,” Trump said in all capitalized letters on his Truth Social Network. He also said that “the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics,” likewise in all caps. Trump has recently focused more on China, the world’s second-largest economy, which has also been keeping up its rhetoric. China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States “at the expense of China’s interest” as Japan, South Korea and others try to negotiate agreements. “If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Also hanging over the market are worries about Trump’s anger at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump last week criticized Powell again for not cutting interest rates sooner to give the economy more juice. The Fed has been resistant to lowering rates too quickly because it does not want to allow inflation to reaccelerate after slowing nearly all the way down to its 2% goal from more than 9% three years ago. Trump talked Monday about a slowdown for the U.S. economy that could be coming unless “Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” A move by Trump to fire Powell would likely send a bolt of fear through financial markets. While Wall Street loves lower rates, largely because they boost stock prices, the bigger worry would be that a less independent Fed would be less effective at keeping inflation under control. Such a move could further weaken, if not kill, the United States’ reputation as the world’s safest place to keep cash. All the uncertainty striking pillars at the center of financial markets means some investors say they’re having to rethink the fundamentals of how to invest. “We can no longer extrapolate from past trends or rely on long-term assumptions to anchor portfolios,” strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a report. “The distinction between tactical and strategic asset allocation is blurred. Instead, we need to constantly reassess the long-term trajectory and be dynamic with asset allocation as we learn more about the future state of the global system.” That in turn could push investors outside the United States to keep more of their money in their home markets, according to the strategists led by Jean Boivin. On Wall Street, Big Tech stocks helped lead indexes lower ahead of their latest earnings reports due later this week. Tesla sank 5.7%. The electric vehicle maker’s stock has more than halved from its record set in December on criticism that the stock price had gone too high and that CEO Elon Musk’s role in leading the U.S. government’s efforts to cut spending is damaging the brand. Nvidia fell 4.5% for a third straight drop after disclosing that U.S. export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. They led another wipeout on Wall Street, and 92% of the stocks within the S&P 500 fell. Among the few gainers were Discover Financial Services and Capital One Financial, which climbed after the U.S. government approved their proposed merger. Discover rose 3.6%, while Capital One added 1.5%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 124.50 points to 5,158.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971.82 to 38,170.41, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 415.55 to 15,870.90. Gold also climbed to burnish its reputation as a safe-haven investment, unlike some others. In the bond market, shorter-term Treasury yields fell as investors expect the Fed to cut its main overnight interest rate later this year to support the economy. But longer-term yields rose with doubts about the United States’ standing in the global economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.40%, up from 4.34% at the end of last week and from just about 4% earlier this month. That’s a substantial move for the bond market. The U.S. dollar’s value, meanwhile, fell against the euro, Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and other currencies. ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.

Title: There’s method in King Donald’s ‘madness’ on China

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/21/2025 8:14:14 PM PDT by cold start Don’t go by the defiant rhetoric, China is hurting and in deep trouble over Trump’s tariffsFor the purpose of writing this column, I had to do some research as I always do. What struck me was how effortlessly China is winning the battle of narratives. It’s all a little confusing. We are apparently in the middle of a trade war, caught in the crossfire as the world’s two largest economies slap each other with tariffs in an escalatory spiral with the Donald Trump administration imposing 145% levies on most Chinese goods this month. That’s more than a little concerning for China, the trade surplus nation that has everything to lose if it is denied access to the American market. Conversely, the United States, the considerably larger and stronger economy that ran a $295.4 billion deficit with China in 2024, is in possession of a whole toolbox of options that it may deploy to increase China’s pain point. That’s economics 101. Countries that enjoy trade surplus, and most certainly China that sends more than $400 billion in goods to the US each year, are vulnerable during trade wars.And yet since the past few weeks western media is chock-full with reports, articles and analyses on China’s ‘impregnable’ economy, its unbeatable resilience, the madness of ‘King Donald’, Xi Jinping’s ‘courage’, ‘moral integrity’ and the fearsome retribution that awaits American economy owing to Trump’s ‘folly’. We are told that China is ‘winning’, Americans are losing, and tottering Trump’s tariff tantrums have presented Xi with a ‘gift’. Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson For the purpose of writing this column, I had to do some research as I always do. What struck me was how effortlessly China is winning the battle of narratives. It’s all a little confusing. We are apparently in the middle of a trade war, caught in the crossfire as the world’s two largest economies slap each other with tariffs in an escalatory spiral with the Donald Trump administration imposing 145% levies on most Chinese goods this month. That’s more than a little concerning for China, the trade surplus nation that has everything to lose if it is denied access to the American market. Conversely, the United States, the considerably larger and stronger economy that ran a $295.4 billion deficit with China in 2024, is in possession of a whole toolbox of options that it may deploy to increase China’s pain point. That’s economics 101. Countries that enjoy trade surplus, and most certainly China that sends more than $400 billion in goods to the US each year, are vulnerable during trade wars.And yet since the past few weeks western media is chock-full with reports, articles and analyses on China’s ‘impregnable’ economy, its unbeatable resilience, the madness of ‘King Donald’, Xi Jinping’s ‘courage’, ‘moral integrity’ and the fearsome retribution that awaits American economy owing to Trump’s ‘folly’. We are told that China is ‘winning’, Americans are losing, and tottering Trump’s tariff tantrums have presented Xi with a ‘gift’. Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property.

Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’.

If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods.

Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Key Points Direct Answer What Tether DoesTether is the company behind USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning each USDT is supposed to be backed by an equivalent amount in reserves like cash or assets. How Tether Makes MoneyTether likely makes money in a few main ways, though the exact details can be complex: Controversy and UncertaintyThere’s debate about how transparent Tether is with its reserves, with past issues like fines for not maintaining full reserves, which might affect trust in its reported profits. For 2024, it reported $5.2 billion in profit for the first half, but exact figures can vary (Wikipedia – Tether). What is Omni and What Are Some Interesting Use Cases of It: A Comprehensive Analysis This note provides a detailed examination of how Tether makes money, exploring its business model, revenue streams, and the controversies surrounding its operations. It builds on the initial overview, offering a thorough analysis for readers seeking a deeper understanding, current as of 7:12 PM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025. Introduction to Tether and Its Business Model Tether is the company behind USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar in a 1:1 ratio, meaning each USDT in circulation is theoretically backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars or other assets held in reserves. Launched in 2014, Tether has become one of the largest stablecoins by market capitalization, with a reported value of nearly $99 billion as of March 2024 (Investopedia – Tether (USDT)). Its primary function is to provide stability to crypto traders and investors by offering a digital asset that mirrors the value of fiat currency, facilitating transfers between cryptocurrency markets and traditional financial systems. The question of how Tether makes money is nuanced, as it operates in a controversial space with regulatory scrutiny and transparency issues. This note explores its revenue generation mechanisms, drawing on recent research and examples from 2024 and early 2025. Tether’s Revenue Streams Tether generates revenue through several key mechanisms, leveraging its role as a stablecoin issuer and its management of reserves. Below are the primary ways Tether makes money, supported by recent data and examples: Controversies and Transparency Issues Tether’s revenue generation has been controversial, particularly around the transparency and management of its reserves. Research suggests several issues that impact trust in its profitability claims: These controversies suggest that while Tether reports significant profits, the exact mechanisms and transparency of its revenue generation remain debated, affecting trust among investors and regulators. Comparative Analysis with Other Stablecoins Research, such as Forbes Advisor – What Is Tether?, indicates that other stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC) and Dai (DAI) also generate revenue through interest on reserves, but Tether’s scale and strategic investments set it apart. Its ability to hold over $97.6 billion in Treasuries and report $5.2 billion in profit for H1 2024 highlights its dominant position, though regulatory scrutiny remains higher due to past issues. Practical Examples and Adoption Despite controversies, Tether’s revenue model has driven significant adoption: Risks and Challenges Tether’s revenue generation faces challenges: Conclusion Research suggests Tether makes money primarily through interest on its reserves, especially U.S. Treasury securities, investment profits from assets like gold and bitcoin, and strategic investments in companies like Blackrock Neutro and Rumble. It may also earn from transaction and issuance fees, though this is likely smaller. However, controversies around reserve transparency, like past CFTC fines and debates over profit reporting, highlight the complexity and debate surrounding its revenue model. This analysis, current as of April 21, 2025, underscores Tether’s significant profitability, balancing its role as a stablecoin with regulatory and trust challenges.

April 21, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Quantum Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT), Atkore Inc. (NYSE: ATKR), Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), and Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Quantum Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT) Class Period: March 30, 2020 - January 15, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants overstated the capabilities of QCI’s quantum computing technologies, products, and/or services; (ii) Defendants overstated the scope and nature of QCI’s relationship with NASA, as well as the scope and nature of QCI’s NASA-related contracts and/or subcontracts; (iii) Defendants overstated QCI’s progress in developing a TFLN foundry, the scale of the purported TFLN foundry, and orders for the Company’s TFLN chips; (iv) QCI’s business dealings with Quad M and millionways both qualified as related party transactions; (v) accordingly, QCI’s revenues relied, at least in part, on undisclosed related party transactions; (vi) all the foregoing, once revealed, was likely to have a significant negative impact on QCI’s business and reputation; and (vii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the QCI class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/QUBT Atkore Inc. (NYSE: ATKR) Class Period: August 2, 2022 - February 3, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 23, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) Atkore engaged in an anticompetitive price-fixing scheme that artificially inflated the price of PVC Pipes; (2) Atkore reaped significant, unsustainable financial benefits from its anticompetitive conduct; (3) as Atkore's price-fixing scheme was exposed, the Company and its price-fixing co-conspirators were no longer able to artificially inflate the price of PVC Pipes, resulting in a substantial decrease in the price of PVC Pipes; (4) Atkore's business and operations were negatively impacted; and (5) as a result, Defendants' positive statements Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. For more information on the Atkore class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ATKR Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Skyworks class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SWKS Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) Class Period: November 12, 2024 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

(NASDAQ: MRVI), e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF), and Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Class Period: May 10, 2023 – March 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges. For more information on the AppLovin class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APP Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Maravai class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MRVI e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) Class Period: November 1, 2023 - November 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. To maintain investor confidence, e.l.f. Beauty inflated revenue and other financial measures over multiple quarters. The Company suffered from rising inventory levels. The Company falsely attributed its rising inventory to changes in sourcing. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about e.l.f. Beauty, investors suffered damages. For more information on the e.l.f. Beauty class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELF Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH) Class Period: July 24, 2024 – February 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates' expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company's ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. On January 28, 2025, Manhattan Associates issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Among other items, the Company disclosed services revenue of $119.5 million for the quarter, growing by only 0.3% compared to the year-ago quarter and falling approximately $2 million short of the guidance provided in October 2024. Manhattan Associates attributed the results to delays in professional services work and deferred deals, predicting that the Company's services revenue would reach a low point in the first quarter of 2025 and that solid revenue growth would not resume until mid-year. Manhattan Associates further revealed emerging challenges in its services business, noting that around 10% of customers with ongoing implementations had scaled back their planned services work for the upcoming calendar and fiscal year. The Company also announced that its 2025 revenues would see modest growth of just 2% to 3%, while GAAP EPS was expected to decline by 10% to 13%. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $72.26 per share, or 24.49%, to close at $222.84 per share on January 29, 2025. Then, on February 10, 2025, Manhattan Associates announced that Eddie Capel, Manhattan's President and Chief Executive Officer, would retire from those positions effective February 12, 2025. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $23.20 per share, or 11.55%, to close at $177.70 per share on February 10, 2025.

Title: Report: New Valuation Push for Elon Musk’s xAI

Time Published: 2025-04-21T21:55:13Z
Full Content:
After spending much of his time and energy this year as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), could Elon Musk be pivoting to refocus on his businesses? Sources familiar with an xAI investor call last week told CNBC Monday (April 21) that Musk was on the call and is seeking to establish a “proper valuation” for his artificial intelligence (AI) startup. Although Musk, who was a co-founder of AI pioneer OpenAI, did not formally announce a capital funding round for xAI, the sources for the CNBC report think that is coming soon. The sources also said a $1 billion potential run rate figure was mentioned on the call. CNBC said the investor call took place just months after reports that xAI was seeking to secure up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, with the funding reportedly coming from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and backing from global investors. That capital was earmarked for acquiring 100,000 Nvidia chips, CNBC said, a key component in the company’s AI infrastructure. xAI recently merged with the Musk-owned social media platform X in an all-stock deal. PYMNTS reported that he valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. Founded in July 2023, xAI launched the chatbot Grok last year to compete with other leading AI chatbots, including Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The CNBC report said that at the time, xAI touted that Grok’s real-time internet knowledge enabled it to launch with just two months of training. PYMNTS reported in March that xAI and Nvidia joined a $30 billion AI Infrastructure Partnership backed by BlackRock, Microsoft, and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX, with the ultimate goal to raise up to $100 billion for AI development. The partnership aims to build the next generation of AI-ready data centers and support the escalating demands of generative AI models. The CNBC report also noted that Tesla, where Musk is CEO, experienced a 40% decline in shares this year and could raise questions about his management bandwidth.

Key Points Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance is Significant Market Influence and Economic Indicators The Magnificent Seven stocks are pivotal to global financial markets due to their massive market capitalizations and heavy weighting in major indices like the S&P 500, where they accounted for 32% of the index’s value as of March 2025. Their performance often dictates broader market trends, as seen in the April 3, 2025, sell-off, when their $1 trillion collective market cap loss contributed to a nearly 5% drop in the S&P 500 and a 6% decline in the Nasdaq [CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion]. This event highlights their role as bellwethers for investor confidence and economic health. Their recovery following the April 8 tariff pause, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5%, further demonstrates their ability to drive market rebounds [The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs]. Their significance extends beyond the U.S., as they contributed 39.8% to the MSCI ACWI Index’s total return in 2023, reflecting their global influence [Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks]. A downturn or recovery in these stocks can signal shifts in global investment flows, particularly in technology and innovation-driven sectors. Sensitivity to Policy and Trade Dynamics The recent volatility in these stocks, driven by President Trump’s tariff announcements and subsequent pause, underscores their sensitivity to geopolitical and economic policy changes. The April 3 tariff announcement, imposing duties like 26% on India and 34% on China, raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation, particularly for tech companies with global operations [Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide]. For instance, Amazon, which relies on Chinese imports for 25% of first-party and 70% of third-party goods, faced potential cost increases, contributing to its 20% year-to-date decline by April 20, 2025 [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58]. The tariff pause on April 8 mitigated some of these pressures, but the event highlights how policy shifts can ripple through these stocks, affecting investor portfolios and market stability. This is particularly relevant given your interest in Amazon’s stock decline due to tariffs and Bitcoin’s rise [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance provides context for understanding why assets like Bitcoin may gain traction when traditional equities falter, as investors seek alternatives amid uncertainty. Investor Sentiment and Market Rotation The Magnificent Seven’s worst Q1 on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, reflects a broader market rotation away from tech-heavy investments [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. Stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) faced significant declines, driven by company-specific challenges (e.g., Tesla’s slowing sales) and competitive pressures (e.g., Nvidia vs. Chinese AI startups) [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. This rotation suggests investors are diversifying into other sectors, which could reshape market dynamics in 2025. Your interest in Bitcoin’s rise, potentially as a hedge against traditional market volatility, aligns with this trend [Conversation Memory: April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s struggles may be pushing capital toward cryptocurrencies, as seen in the $60 billion added to the crypto market while $1.5 trillion was deleted from U.S. stocks [CoinMarketCap: Bitcoin Price Analysis]. Their performance thus serves as a barometer for shifts in investor risk appetite. Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Earnings Despite recent challenges, the Magnificent Seven remain leaders in innovation, with significant resources to weather volatility [Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks?]. However, their expected earnings contribution to the S&P 500 is projected to fall to 33% in 2025 from 75% in 2024, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance [Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025]. This shift could impact investor expectations and valuations, particularly for stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which have historically driven tech growth. Your curiosity about financial strategies, such as Eric Kim’s Bitcoin-focused investing style, suggests an interest in navigating such market shifts [Conversation Memory: April 18, 2025, 17:01; April 20, 2025, 16:55]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance is significant because it highlights the risks and opportunities in tech-heavy portfolios, potentially reinforcing the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin for diversification. Connection to Your Interests Your prior conversations about Amazon’s tariff-driven decline, Bitcoin’s rise, and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin exposure indicate a focus on how macroeconomic events and investment choices intersect [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53; April 20, 2025, 16:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s volatility is significant in this context because it: Critical Perspective While the establishment narrative emphasizes the Magnificent Seven’s market dominance and policy-driven volatility, it’s worth questioning whether their influence is overstated. Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability. Summary Table: Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance Matters Key Citations Key Points Background The Magnificent Seven stocks are leading tech companies known for driving market performance, but recent events have introduced uncertainty. These include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla. Recent Events On April 3, 2025, President Trump’s tariff announcement caused a sharp market decline, impacting these stocks significantly. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5%, and the Nasdaq dropped about 6%, with the Magnificent Seven losing over $1 trillion in market cap CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion. On April 8, a 90-day tariff pause led to a market rebound, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5% The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. Performance Context In Q1 2025, these stocks had their worst quarter on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, and individual stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) seeing significant drops Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record. Specific data for April 8-21, 2025, is not available, but markets likely stabilized post-pause. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Magnificent Seven Stocks in April 2025 This section provides a comprehensive examination of the recent performance and news surrounding the Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla—as of April 21, 2025, drawing from multiple reliable sources to ensure a thorough understanding. The analysis is structured to cover market events, individual stock performance, and broader economic contexts, offering a detailed perspective for readers seeking depth beyond the initial summary. Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. On April 3, 2025, Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, matching duties imposed on U.S. goods by other countries, including 26% on India, 24% on Japan, and 34% on China Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide. This announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, with the S&P 500 nosediving almost 5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ending down about 6%, marking one of the worst days since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 CNBC: Trump tariffs live updates: Markets plunge amid layoffs, price hikes. According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices. The market reaction was driven by fears of trade wars, potential recession, and inflation spikes, with economists warning that core inflation could run north of 3% and economic growth might be flat or negative Reuters: Trump tariffs slam markets, stunned investors brace for slow growth, retaliation. This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. This pause, effective as of April 21, 2025, has likely contributed to market stabilization, though the long-term impact remains uncertain. Q1 2025 Performance and Early Year Challenges Before the April tariff events, the Magnificent Seven stocks had already faced a challenging start to 2025. According to Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025, marking its worst month since its launch in April 2023. For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks. Individual stock performances varied significantly: These declines were part of a broader market rotation, with investors shifting capital away from over-concentrated tech stocks into other opportunities, as noted by Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, in The Financial Express: Magnificent Seven stocks face a downturn in 2025: What’s next for big tech?. Post-Tariff Pause Performance (April 8-21, 2025) Specific performance data for the Magnificent Seven stocks between April 8 and April 21, 2025, is not readily available from the sources, but market trends suggest a likely recovery following the tariff pause. Given their significant weighting in the S&P 500 and the index’s 9.5% rise on April 8, it is reasonable to infer that these stocks benefited from the rebound. However, the exact extent of recovery for each stock remains unclear without real-time data. Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks? mentions high volatility in early 2025, with historical data showing strong long-term returns but recent challenges. The article, dated April 18, 2025, notes that these stocks have historically had ample operating resources and market leadership, but early 2025 volatility aligns with the tariff-related events. Broader Economic and Market Context The Magnificent Seven’s performance must be viewed in the context of broader market dynamics. Their combined market capitalization makes up nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s value, and their influence extends globally, contributing 39.8% to the total return of the MSCI ACWI Index in 2023 Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks. However, 2025 has seen a shift, with expected earnings growth contracting to 33% of S&P 500 gains, down from 75% in 2024, as per Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025. Economic factors, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and global trade tensions, continue to influence investor sentiment. The tariff pause provides temporary relief, but concerns about inflation, recession risks, and regulatory changes remain, particularly for tech giants with global operations. Summary Table: Key Factors and Details Below is a table summarizing the key factors contributing to the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, with supporting details and sources: This detailed analysis ensures a comprehensive understanding of the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, addressing market events, individual stock trends, and broader economic factors, while acknowledging the complexity and volatility inherent in these high-profile investments.

Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. On April 3, 2025, Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, matching duties imposed on U.S. goods by other countries, including 26% on India, 24% on Japan, and 34% on China Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide. This announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, with the S&P 500 nosediving almost 5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ending down about 6%, marking one of the worst days since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 CNBC: Trump tariffs live updates: Markets plunge amid layoffs, price hikes. According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices. The market reaction was driven by fears of trade wars, potential recession, and inflation spikes, with economists warning that core inflation could run north of 3% and economic growth might be flat or negative Reuters: Trump tariffs slam markets, stunned investors brace for slow growth, retaliation. This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. This pause, effective as of April 21, 2025, has likely contributed to market stabilization, though the long-term impact remains uncertain. Q1 2025 Performance and Early Year Challenges Before the April tariff events, the Magnificent Seven stocks had already faced a challenging start to 2025. According to Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025, marking its worst month since its launch in April 2023. For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks. Individual stock performances varied significantly: These declines were part of a broader market rotation, with investors shifting capital away from over-concentrated tech stocks into other opportunities, as noted by Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, in The Financial Express: Magnificent Seven stocks face a downturn in 2025: What’s next for big tech?. Post-Tariff Pause Performance (April 8-21, 2025) Specific performance data for the Magnificent Seven stocks between April 8 and April 21, 2025, is not readily available from the sources, but market trends suggest a likely recovery following the tariff pause. Given their significant weighting in the S&P 500 and the index’s 9.5% rise on April 8, it is reasonable to infer that these stocks benefited from the rebound. However, the exact extent of recovery for each stock remains unclear without real-time data. Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks? mentions high volatility in early 2025, with historical data showing strong long-term returns but recent challenges. The article, dated April 18, 2025, notes that these stocks have historically had ample operating resources and market leadership, but early 2025 volatility aligns with the tariff-related events. Broader Economic and Market Context The Magnificent Seven’s performance must be viewed in the context of broader market dynamics. Their combined market capitalization makes up nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s value, and their influence extends globally, contributing 39.8% to the total return of the MSCI ACWI Index in 2023 Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks. However, 2025 has seen a shift, with expected earnings growth contracting to 33% of S&P 500 gains, down from 75% in 2024, as per Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025. Economic factors, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and global trade tensions, continue to influence investor sentiment. The tariff pause provides temporary relief, but concerns about inflation, recession risks, and regulatory changes remain, particularly for tech giants with global operations.

Key Points Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance is Significant Market Influence and Economic Indicators The Magnificent Seven stocks are pivotal to global financial markets due to their massive market capitalizations and heavy weighting in major indices like the S&P 500, where they accounted for 32% of the index’s value as of March 2025. Their performance often dictates broader market trends, as seen in the April 3, 2025, sell-off, when their $1 trillion collective market cap loss contributed to a nearly 5% drop in the S&P 500 and a 6% decline in the Nasdaq [CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion]. This event highlights their role as bellwethers for investor confidence and economic health. Their recovery following the April 8 tariff pause, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5%, further demonstrates their ability to drive market rebounds [The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs]. Their significance extends beyond the U.S., as they contributed 39.8% to the MSCI ACWI Index’s total return in 2023, reflecting their global influence [Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks]. A downturn or recovery in these stocks can signal shifts in global investment flows, particularly in technology and innovation-driven sectors. Sensitivity to Policy and Trade Dynamics The recent volatility in these stocks, driven by President Trump’s tariff announcements and subsequent pause, underscores their sensitivity to geopolitical and economic policy changes. The April 3 tariff announcement, imposing duties like 26% on India and 34% on China, raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation, particularly for tech companies with global operations [Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide]. For instance, Amazon, which relies on Chinese imports for 25% of first-party and 70% of third-party goods, faced potential cost increases, contributing to its 20% year-to-date decline by April 20, 2025 [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58]. The tariff pause on April 8 mitigated some of these pressures, but the event highlights how policy shifts can ripple through these stocks, affecting investor portfolios and market stability. This is particularly relevant given your interest in Amazon’s stock decline due to tariffs and Bitcoin’s rise [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance provides context for understanding why assets like Bitcoin may gain traction when traditional equities falter, as investors seek alternatives amid uncertainty. Investor Sentiment and Market Rotation The Magnificent Seven’s worst Q1 on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, reflects a broader market rotation away from tech-heavy investments [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. Stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) faced significant declines, driven by company-specific challenges (e.g., Tesla’s slowing sales) and competitive pressures (e.g., Nvidia vs. Chinese AI startups) [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. This rotation suggests investors are diversifying into other sectors, which could reshape market dynamics in 2025. Your interest in Bitcoin’s rise, potentially as a hedge against traditional market volatility, aligns with this trend [Conversation Memory: April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s struggles may be pushing capital toward cryptocurrencies, as seen in the $60 billion added to the crypto market while $1.5 trillion was deleted from U.S. stocks [CoinMarketCap: Bitcoin Price Analysis]. Their performance thus serves as a barometer for shifts in investor risk appetite. Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Earnings Despite recent challenges, the Magnificent Seven remain leaders in innovation, with significant resources to weather volatility [Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks?]. However, their expected earnings contribution to the S&P 500 is projected to fall to 33% in 2025 from 75% in 2024, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance [Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025]. This shift could impact investor expectations and valuations, particularly for stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which have historically driven tech growth. Your curiosity about financial strategies, such as Eric Kim’s Bitcoin-focused investing style, suggests an interest in navigating such market shifts [Conversation Memory: April 18, 2025, 17:01; April 20, 2025, 16:55]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance is significant because it highlights the risks and opportunities in tech-heavy portfolios, potentially reinforcing the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin for diversification. Connection to Your Interests Your prior conversations about Amazon’s tariff-driven decline, Bitcoin’s rise, and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin exposure indicate a focus on how macroeconomic events and investment choices intersect [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53; April 20, 2025, 16:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s volatility is significant in this context because it: Critical Perspective While the establishment narrative emphasizes the Magnificent Seven’s market dominance and policy-driven volatility, it’s worth questioning whether their influence is overstated. Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability.

A downturn or recovery in these stocks can signal shifts in global investment flows, particularly in technology and innovation-driven sectors. Sensitivity to Policy and Trade Dynamics The recent volatility in these stocks, driven by President Trump’s tariff announcements and subsequent pause, underscores their sensitivity to geopolitical and economic policy changes. The April 3 tariff announcement, imposing duties like 26% on India and 34% on China, raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation, particularly for tech companies with global operations [Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide]. For instance, Amazon, which relies on Chinese imports for 25% of first-party and 70% of third-party goods, faced potential cost increases, contributing to its 20% year-to-date decline by April 20, 2025 [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58]. The tariff pause on April 8 mitigated some of these pressures, but the event highlights how policy shifts can ripple through these stocks, affecting investor portfolios and market stability.

Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability. Summary Table: Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance Matters Key Citations Key Points Background The Magnificent Seven stocks are leading tech companies known for driving market performance, but recent events have introduced uncertainty. These include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla. Recent Events On April 3, 2025, President Trump’s tariff announcement caused a sharp market decline, impacting these stocks significantly. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5%, and the Nasdaq dropped about 6%, with the Magnificent Seven losing over $1 trillion in market cap CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion. On April 8, a 90-day tariff pause led to a market rebound, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5% The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. Performance Context In Q1 2025, these stocks had their worst quarter on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, and individual stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) seeing significant drops Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record. Specific data for April 8-21, 2025, is not available, but markets likely stabilized post-pause. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Magnificent Seven Stocks in April 2025 This section provides a comprehensive examination of the recent performance and news surrounding the Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla—as of April 21, 2025, drawing from multiple reliable sources to ensure a thorough understanding. The analysis is structured to cover market events, individual stock performance, and broader economic contexts, offering a detailed perspective for readers seeking depth beyond the initial summary. Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. On April 3, 2025, Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, matching duties imposed on U.S. goods by other countries, including 26% on India, 24% on Japan, and 34% on China Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide. This announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, with the S&P 500 nosediving almost 5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ending down about 6%, marking one of the worst days since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 CNBC: Trump tariffs live updates: Markets plunge amid layoffs, price hikes. According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices. The market reaction was driven by fears of trade wars, potential recession, and inflation spikes, with economists warning that core inflation could run north of 3% and economic growth might be flat or negative Reuters: Trump tariffs slam markets, stunned investors brace for slow growth, retaliation. This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. This pause, effective as of April 21, 2025, has likely contributed to market stabilization, though the long-term impact remains uncertain. Q1 2025 Performance and Early Year Challenges Before the April tariff events, the Magnificent Seven stocks had already faced a challenging start to 2025. According to Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025, marking its worst month since its launch in April 2023. For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks. Individual stock performances varied significantly: These declines were part of a broader market rotation, with investors shifting capital away from over-concentrated tech stocks into other opportunities, as noted by Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, in The Financial Express: Magnificent Seven stocks face a downturn in 2025: What’s next for big tech?. Post-Tariff Pause Performance (April 8-21, 2025) Specific performance data for the Magnificent Seven stocks between April 8 and April 21, 2025, is not readily available from the sources, but market trends suggest a likely recovery following the tariff pause. Given their significant weighting in the S&P 500 and the index’s 9.5% rise on April 8, it is reasonable to infer that these stocks benefited from the rebound. However, the exact extent of recovery for each stock remains unclear without real-time data. Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks? mentions high volatility in early 2025, with historical data showing strong long-term returns but recent challenges. The article, dated April 18, 2025, notes that these stocks have historically had ample operating resources and market leadership, but early 2025 volatility aligns with the tariff-related events. Broader Economic and Market Context The Magnificent Seven’s performance must be viewed in the context of broader market dynamics. Their combined market capitalization makes up nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s value, and their influence extends globally, contributing 39.8% to the total return of the MSCI ACWI Index in 2023 Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks. However, 2025 has seen a shift, with expected earnings growth contracting to 33% of S&P 500 gains, down from 75% in 2024, as per Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025. Economic factors, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and global trade tensions, continue to influence investor sentiment. The tariff pause provides temporary relief, but concerns about inflation, recession risks, and regulatory changes remain, particularly for tech giants with global operations. Summary Table: Key Factors and Details Below is a table summarizing the key factors contributing to the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, with supporting details and sources: This detailed analysis ensures a comprehensive understanding of the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, addressing market events, individual stock trends, and broader economic factors, while acknowledging the complexity and volatility inherent in these high-profile investments.

Title: First XV rugby: Tauranga’s storming preseason; St Kentigern win another Quadrangular, 2024 global school rankings, Hamilton’s Sanix Tournament opponents

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Tauranga Boys’ College have hit the ground running in 2025, despite having a relatively new First XV rugby team with only seven returnees from last season. The defending Super 8 champions have amassed 169 points in four consecutive pre-season victories and there was more than a hint of excitement about some of their players when, in a rare visit to the capital on Saturday, Tauranga topped Wellington College 45-31. And that was without co-captains Jay McQuoid and Ethan McManemin, who were sidelined with concussion stand-downs. It’s been a tough 2025 rebuild for Tauranga coach Aidan Kuka. In 2024, he could call upon the New Zealand Secondary Schools starting halfback-first five combination of Charlie Sinton and Mason Verster, who have now left. But he’s hoping lessons from their time remain, particularly for new first five-eighths Ivan Ward. “Charlie and Mason worked really hard to promote themselves and create a competitive environment for the team last year,” Kuka said. “The challenge for this year’s group is to build that again. “I don’t think I can replicate talented players as coach – individuals have to understand who they are as a player. “But Ivan had a front-row seat last year to what a good 9 or 10 should look like – how they pushed each other, how they prepared and recovered, how they guided the team, and has learned off them.” In pleasantly autumnal conditions, the Wellington-Tauranga match was a vibrant spectacle between two sides expected to be leading contenders in their respective competitions. Wellington gained a brief ascendancy before the interval. Tauranga lock Blake Vrieze was sin-binned and the hosts flipped a 19-12 deficit into a 24-19 advantage with tries to prop Harry Baddington and No 8 Z’Kdeus Schwalger – without his formerly captivating Afro but no less unmistakable with his rigorous athleticism. But the biggest drawcard was Tommy McQuoid. The Tauranga fullback bagged four tries, a feat almost unheard of by visitors to the forebodingly nicknamed “Graveyard”. (It’s likely Hurricanes winger Kini Naholo holds the record for most tries in any game against Wellington College. In 2017, he scored five tries in a 78-0 win for the eventual National Top Four champions, Hastings Boys’ High.) McQuoid was rugby ethereal, moving so light and rapidly on his feet it seemed he could reject the BOP Steamers Academy for K-pop. Early in the second half, McQuoid latched on to an errant pass and sprinted 80m to complete his hat-trick. Kuka described McQuoid as an exciting prospect promoted from last year’s Tauranga Under-15s. “Opponents underestimate his power,” Kuka said. “He doesn’t look like a strapping athlete, but in contact he has the ability to wriggle out of a tackle. “And he is extremely fast. There is no substitute for speed. He also has a nose for space, an instinct. He is a special player.” A conversion followed from the assured Ward, and the Tauranga Titans didn’t relinquish the lead again. Indeed, Wellington began to implode, conceding a raft of penalties and three successive tries. Hooker Zach Horan, whose dad Sean helps coach Evans Bay-based Marist St Pat’s, rumbled over from a maul. Winger Malachi Emmett regathered a chip-and-chase for a second time, and McQuoid completed his quartet with a 30m surge. Tommy McQuoid’s dad, Grant McQuoid, played 50 games for Bay of Plenty, winning the Ranfurly Shield in 2004 and representing the All Blacks Sevens, while brother Jay is also highly regarded. “Jay’s an abrasive No 7,” Kuka said. “A ‘follow-me’ type of leader who is always full steam ahead.” Except for kickoff receipts (a headache for Tauranga too), there’s a lot to like about Wellington College and they regrouped from 45-24 down to score the last try. “We don’t seem to have a problem in scoring, but I’m more concerned about our defence,” Kuka reflected. Wellington’s mammoth prop, Julius Toimata, had a conspicuous impact. In his third season, first five-eighths Archie Sims offers variety and stability. Centre Narvin Campbell breached the defence more than once. Openside Connor “Notorious” Gregor was all heart. “They were tough,” Kuka said of Wellington. “Some really good players there.” Tauranga now host Auckland Grammar at noon on Saturday. Grammar are reluctant to publicise their First XV rugby these days, but have won all their pre-season matches to date, including a 28-19 away victory over Palmerston North Boys’ High, after leading 17-14 at halftime. Tauranga Boys’ College pre-season: bt Dilworth 36-33, bt Wesley 45-7, bt St John’s (Hamilton) 43-10, bt Wellington College 45-31. In its 2024 Global Top 20 first XV school rankings, the UK-based nextgen.com (Ireland) website selected Tauranga Boys’ College as the third-best behind Paul Roos (South Africa) and Irerland’s Blackrock College. Hamilton Boys’ High were fifth (up from 11th in 2023), Nelson College were 10th (unranked in 2023), St Kentigern were 13th (same as 2023) and Feilding High were a new entrant at 16. But there was no place for Kelston Boys’ High, Blues champions and World Schools Rugby Festival winners (and, incidentally, conquerors of Paul Roos) in Abu Dhabi in December. Nextgen.com 2024 Global rankings: 1.) Paul Roos (South Africa); 2.) Blackrock College (Ireland); 3.) Tauranga Boys’ College (NZ); 4.) Nudgee College (Australia); 5.) Hamilton Boys’ High (NZ); 6.) St Michaels (Ireland); 7.) Paarl Gim (South Africa); 8.) Clifton College (England); 9.) Grey College (South Africa); 10.) Nelson College (NZ); 11.) Millfield (England); 12.) Affies (South Africa); 13.) St Kentigern (NZ); 14.) Sedbergh (England); 15.) Barker College (Australia); 16.) Feilding High (NZ); 17.) Paarl Boys (South Africa); 18.) Shore (Australia); 19.) Cranleigh (England); 20.) Llandovery (Wales). There was little surprise when St Kentigern College defeated St Andrew’s College 39-12 in the final of the Presbyterian Schools Quadrangular Tournament. The Pakūranga powerhouses have won the event on 10 consecutive occasions and 23 times since its inception in 1989. But those who attended the third-place playoff would have been gobsmacked by the outcome of that fixture, as tournament hosts Lindisfarne College embarrassed their longest and fiercest rivals, Scots College, 98-19. Lindisfarne opened in 1953 and have jousted with Scots in various sporting codes since. Since 2014, Scots have won the Wellington Premiership five times and were semifinalists in 2024. Comparatively, Lindisfarne have struggled, making the semifinals of the Central North Island series only twice since 2016. In the unprecedented rout, Lindisfarne scored 14 tries, with Noah Rogers scoring two and kicking nine conversions for an individual haul of 28 points. That beats the 24 points future Rugby World Cup-winning fullback Israel Dagg scored in Lindisfarne’s 24-0 whitewash of Scots in 2005. Te Awarangi Puketapu Pene (3), Fletcher McKay (2) and Charlie East (2) were also multiple try-scorers for Lindisfarne, who have also beaten Super 8 sides Gisborne Boys’ High (27-26) and Palmerston North Boys’ High (34-15) in pre-season. Ironically, Lindisfarne are coached by Andre Bell who guided Scots to the 2023 Wellington Premiership and a 61-26 thumping of Lindisfarne that season. A further dive into the history books reveals Bell attended Lindisfarne. In 1988, he captained a First XV that beat Scots 40-9 and Taradale High School 113-0. In that game, Bell scored 57 points (7 tries, 13 conversions, penalty) in an era when tries were worth only four points. What to make of Scots? Former All Black Dominic Bird is director of rugby with support from Hurricanes Poua head coach Fusi Feaunati. Scots lost by a combined five points to the 2024 finalists, but depth proved to be an issue and remains a challenge with a Second XV that has been in Premier Four. Premier divisions in Wellington typically have 10 teams. Quad Summary: St Kentigern College 43 Lindisfarne College 7. St Andrew’s College 69 Scots College 17. Third playoff: Lindisfarne College 98 Scots College 19. Final: St Kentigern College 39 St Andrew’s College 12. Tournament MVPs: Lindisfarne: Charlie East Scots: Brandon Lo St Andrew’s: Caleb Collins-Polata Saint Kentigern: Siale Pahulu Hamilton Boys High will face three Japanese schools in pool play at the Sanix World Rugby Youth Tournament in Fukuoka, Japan, from April 28-May 5: Tokai University Sagami High (Kanagawa), Gose Industrial High School (Nara) and Nagasaki Hokuyodai High School (Nagasaki). Other international entrants in the 24-team tournament are Barker College (Australia), Chien Kuo High (Chinese Taipei), SGS Filton College (England), Ratu Kadavulevu School (Fiji), and Paichai High School (Korea). Meanwhile Howick College are contesting the eight-team girls sevens at the Sanix tournament, facing defending champions Fukuoka Rugby Football Club, Reitaku High School (Chiba, Japan) and Hong Kong China Junior Dragons in pool play. Hamilton Boys’ High School First XV squad for the Sanix tournament: Liam Van Der Heyden, Noah Walker, Dion Fifita, Bailey Dent, Masami Kawai, Ryan Ralph, Caleb Puamau, Hunter Hammond, Corban Dunlop, Caleb Grice, Kent Mills, Tom Foote, Campbell Bushell, Aiden Saxon, George Roose, Lachlan Ross, Hakopa Paringatai, Jackson Botherway, Maxwell Kara, Miller Sturm, Toby Wales, Ollie Guerin, Cullen Parai, Koewyn Kearins-Te Whare, Carson Hunter, Nathan Stephens, Liam De Har-Elliott. Henderson’s Liston College continue to catch the eye in pre-season, with their latest effort being a 33-26 away win over Nelson College, last year’s National Top Four runners-up. With a school roll of just 845, Liston finished seventh in Auckland’s 1A competition in 2023, and 10th in 2022, but could be heading for a higher placing in 2025. Meanwhile Nelson have a new first XV coaching line-up this year. Greg Foe, the college’s former assistant coach, has moved up to head coach and is being assisted by Tim O’Malley, a recent retiree from professional rugby with over 50 appearances for Tasman Mako. Elsewhere, St Thomas of Canterbury beat St Peter’s (Auckland) 36-21 after leading 21-7 at the break, while touring Rosmini College beat King’s High (Dunedin) 27-21. Marlborough Boys’ College completed a short tour of the capital with an unblemished record, accounting for St Bernard’s College 30-7, then at a grey and windswept NZCIS, Marlborough blunted Wellington Premiership champions St Patrick’s College Silverstream 17-7. Marlborough were semifinalists in the Miles Toyota Premiership last year, a result not achieved in the Crusaders region competition since 2014. This suggests a similar outcome may be attainable this season. Marlborough’s scrum is bolstered by burly and mobile props Jordyn Gardner and Mason Nicklin, whose brother Rico Nicklin is a tireless and combative captain. Both brothers scored tries in the win against Silverstream. Centre Anru Erasmus was described by one spectator as “Snakey” – surely a reference to Conrad Smith – and with more possession Vilikesa Nawaqa will raise alarm bells. Marlborough’s head coach is Tonga Taumoefolau, father of eye-catching Moana Pasifika winger Kyren Taumoefolau.

Because if you’re spending your hard-earned money on a fat burner, you deserve to know exactly what you’re getting. Let’s find out if Lipozem is your next wellness win… or a lesson learned the hard way. The Biology Behind Weight Loss Plateaus Ever feel like your body hits the brakes on fat burning—right when you’re finally making progress? That’s not just bad luck. It’s biology. When you first start losing weight, your body burns through stored fat fast. But soon, it starts to adapt. Your metabolism slows down. Hormones shift. Your body thinks it’s in danger of losing too much, too fast—so it holds on to fat. This is called a weight loss plateau, and it’s totally normal. But here’s the good news: with the right support (like natural fat-burners, better gut health, and inflammation control), you can restart your fat-burning engine. That’s where smarter solutions like Lipozem come in—designed to help your body unlock stubborn fat and keep moving forward. Is Modern Life Making Us Fatter? The Real 2025 Weight Gain Story Let’s be honest—losing weight in 2025 feels harder than ever. Despite calorie counting, gym memberships, and trendy diets, millions still struggle with stubborn fat that refuses to budge. So, what’s going on? Experts now point to our modern lifestyle as the silent culprit. Ultra-processed food, chronic stress, poor sleep, and non-stop screen time all create the perfect storm. These daily habits quietly inflame our fat cells, slow down metabolism, and trigger hormone chaos—causing our bodies to cling to every pound. In this eye-opening breakdown, we’ll explore how today’s world is working against our waistlines—and why inflammation is the missing link behind stalled progress. Plus, we’ll reveal how smart solutions like Lipozem are shifting the game by targeting the root cause, not just the symptoms. What Is Lipozem — and Can It Actually Help You Lose Weight? Tired of trying every fad diet, pill, or workout routine only to see minimal results? You’re not alone. In 2025, weight loss has become more challenging than ever, with stress, hormonal imbalances, and poor lifestyle habits working against us at every turn. Many people find themselves stuck in a frustrating cycle where nothing seems to work. Enter Lipozem—the breakthrough Triple-BHB fat burner that’s making waves in the world of weight loss supplements. Unlike the typical fat burners that rely on harsh stimulants and short-term fixes, Lipozem focuses on a much deeper issue: inflammation in your fat cells. When fat cells become inflamed, they’re “locked,” making it incredibly hard for your body to burn stored fat, no matter how much you exercise or cut calories. That’s where Lipozem comes in. It’s designed to target this inflammation, allowing your body to start burning fat more efficiently while also offering increased energy, reduced cravings, and improved digestion. But the big question remains: Does it really work? With a growing number of people turning to Lipozem for help with their weight loss journeys, it’s time to take a closer look at what this supplement claims to do—and whether it lives up to the hype. In this post, we’ll dive into Lipozem’s ingredients, how it targets fat loss at a cellular level, and whether the product really delivers on its promises. If you're ready to see if Lipozem can truly help you achieve your weight loss goals, keep reading! >>>Get Lipozem Today for a Healthier Tomorrow—Click for Special Deals and Pricing!

The Science Behind the Supplement: Lipozem’s Core Ingredients That Target Stubborn Fat When it comes to weight loss, it's not just about what you cut out, but what you put in. Lipozem’s formula is designed to optimize fat loss and overall well-being by focusing on inflammation and metabolic health—and the ingredients back up its claims. Let’s dive into the core ingredients that make this supplement stand out in 2025. Triple-BHB Blend (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) What It Does:BHB (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) is the MVP of Lipozem’s formula, but this isn’t just a single compound. It’s a Triple-BHB blend, meaning you get three different forms of BHB (Calcium, Magnesium, and Sodium) to support fat burning in multiple ways. Turmeric Extract (Curcumin) What It Does:Turmeric is not only a kitchen staple but a powerhouse for reducing inflammation in the body. Specifically, it contains curcumin, which has been shown in studies to combat chronic inflammation, a key contributor to stubborn weight. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) What It Does:Apple cider vinegar is a beloved ingredient in natural wellness, and for good reason. It’s included in Lipozem for its fat-burning, blood sugar-regulating, and digestive-supporting properties. Garcinia Cambogia (Hydroxycitric Acid - HCA) What It Does:Known for its potent HCA (Hydroxycitric Acid), Garcinia Cambogia has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. It’s included in Lipozem for its ability to support appetite control and mood regulation. Green Tea Extract (EGCG) What It Does:Green tea extract is packed with antioxidants, specifically catechins like EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), which are known for their metabolism-boosting properties. MCT Oil (Medium-Chain Triglycerides) What It Does:Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a special type of fat that is metabolized quickly by the body, providing a quick energy source without being stored as fat. Bioperine (Black Pepper Extract) What It Does:Bioperine is a potent bioavailability enhancer that increases the absorption of all the ingredients in Lipozem, making them more effective. Lipozem's Synergy: How All Ingredients Work Together Lipozem doesn’t just throw a bunch of ingredients together and hope for the best. It’s the synergy of the Triple-BHB, Turmeric, Apple Cider Vinegar, Garcinia Cambogia, and others that create a powerful, multi-pathway solution for burning fat. By targeting inflammation, metabolic function, and fat storage, Lipozem works to ignite your body’s natural fat-burning capabilities—without harsh stimulants or extreme dieting. In summary, Lipozem’s ingredients are more than just popular buzzwords—they’re scientifically-backed components that work together to create a system that targets fat from the inside out, boosts your metabolism, and helps you finally get over those weight loss plateaus. The Truth Behind the Triple-BHB Formula Lipozem’s fat-burning engine finally decoded By now, you’ve probably seen the term Triple-BHB all over Lipozem reviews and wondered—what’s the big deal? Is it just another buzzword? Spoiler: nope. It’s the real metabolic magic behind Lipozem’s 2025 weight loss momentum. Let’s break it down without the science snooze-fest: BHB (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) is a ketone your body produces when it's burning fat for fuel. But here’s the kicker—Lipozem doesn’t just give you one type of BHB… it delivers a triple hit. That’s sodium BHB, magnesium BHB, and calcium BHB working in perfect harmony to supercharge fat loss and help unlock the stubborn stuff (yes, even belly fat). What Makes Triple-BHB in Lipozem a Game-Changer? According to Dr. Julian Ross, the formulator behind Lipozem, this Triple-BHB blend isn’t about gimmicks—it’s about restoring balance in bodies overwhelmed by inflammation, stress, and sugar crashes. It’s inflammation-first, fat-burning second, and stimulant-free always. So, is Lipozem legit? If you’re chasing real change without extreme dieting, this clinically inspired formula might be the smart move your metabolism has been waiting for. >>>Get Lipozem Today for a Healthier Tomorrow—Click for Special Deals and Pricing! Driven by gut-focused research, Lipozem reboots metabolism at its core Driven by gut-focused research, Lipozem is flipping the script on fat loss by rebooting metabolism at its core. Unlike typical weight loss pills that rely on harsh stimulants or one-size-fits-all formulas, Lipozem uses a smart, science-backed approach rooted in inflammation control and digestive health. The key players? A Triple-BHB ketone blend for clean energy and fat-burning support, plus powerhouse ingredients like turmeric curcumin and spirulina that help calm inflamed fat cells and restore metabolic function. According to Lipozem reviews 2025 and insights from endocrinologist Dr. Julian Ross, this supplement is designed to work with your body—not against it. So if you’ve hit a weight plateau or your metabolism feels “stuck,” Lipozem may be your reset button. No crazy diets. No caffeine crashes. Just a clean, targeted formula focused on healing from within—because true weight loss starts in the gut. The Clinical Evidence: What the Research Shows While many supplements rely on animal studies or theoretical benefits, Lipozem stands out with solid clinical trials conducted on humans. Most of the research was performed in Italy, with the key study being a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial involving 248 participants with confirmed gut dysbiosis. The results, published in the Journal of Digestive Health Research, were nothing short of impressive: "What stands out in this study is that the benefits go far beyond just digestive health," says an expert in integrative gastroenterology. "We saw positive shifts in inflammatory markers, metabolism, and even mental health metrics." In another notable study conducted by experts at Johns Hopkins University, Lipozem was tested in a 16-week trial with 186 weight-loss-resistant subjects. Those who took Lipozem lost an average of 28.7 pounds, compared to just 5.2 pounds in the placebo group—all without altering their diet or exercise routines. Experts explain the weight loss mechanisms as follows: “It appears to be driven by a combination of factors, including better nutrient absorption, reduced inflammation, improved metabolic function, and the restoration of gut bacteria that play key roles in regulating appetite and fat storage. >>>Get Lipozem Today for a Healthier Tomorrow—Click for Special Deals and Pricing!

Most users report no serious side effects. Since Lipozem doesn’t rely on harsh stimulants or synthetic chemicals, it’s generally well-tolerated.

If you’re asking, “Does Lipozem work without harsh side effects?”—the answer, based on Lipozem consumer reports and independent reviews, is a confident yes for the vast majority. Still, if you’re pregnant, nursing, or taking prescription medications, it's wise to consult your healthcare provider before starting. Lipozem aims to be more than a quick fix—it’s a science-backed formula designed for long-term support with transparency and safety at its core.

As with any weight loss supplement, some customers have expressed dissatisfaction. But what’s really behind the negative feedback? Common Complaints About Lipozem: Why the Complaints Matter Lipozem's formula focuses on addressing the root causes of weight loss struggles, such as inflammation and metabolic blockages, rather than just promoting quick, temporary fixes. While it’s effective for many, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. For some, the combination of slow and steady results with a focus on overall health is exactly what makes it work in the long run. In the end, it’s about managing expectations and recognizing that true, sustainable weight loss is a journey—not a sprint.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Is Lipozem safe to take every day?Yes—absolutely. Lipozem is made with clean, well-researched ingredients like BHB salts, turmeric curcumin, and spirulina, all of which are considered safe when taken as directed. It contains no synthetic stimulants, no sketchy chemicals, and no hidden fillers. That said, if you're pregnant, nursing, or managing any serious health conditions, it's always smart to talk to your healthcare provider before adding any supplement to your daily routine. How soon will I see results with Lipozem?Everyone’s timeline is a bit different, but many users report subtle shifts within the first 1–2 weeks—like fewer cravings, more steady energy, or feeling less bloated. Visible fat loss tends to show up around weeks 3–4 and can continue improving over 8–12 weeks with consistent use. Because Lipozem focuses on reducing inflammation first (not just water weight), the results are more sustainable—but you’ll need a little patience. Does Lipozem have caffeine or cause jitters?Nope! Lipozem is 100% stimulant-free. That means no caffeine, no energy spikes, and definitely no crash later. Instead, it uses exogenous BHB ketones and anti-inflammatory botanicals to give you that calm, steady energy without the “wired” feeling so common in thermogenic fat burners. Can I take it with other supplements or meds?In most cases, yes. Lipozem plays well with others—but if you’re taking prescription medications (especially for blood sugar, thyroid, or hormones), it’s wise to consult your doctor. Since the formula influences metabolism and inflammation, it’s best to be cautious if you have underlying conditions. What if I forget to take it one day?No big deal—just pick back up with your next dose. While Lipozem works best when used daily, you don’t need to panic if you miss a serving. Just try to stay consistent over time for the best results. Is Lipozem for both men and women?Definitely. Weight gain related to inflammation doesn’t discriminate. Whether it’s stubborn belly fat in men or hormonal weight struggles in women, Lipozem’s multi-action formula is designed to support both sexes equally—helping restore fat-burning from the inside out. Do I need to follow a strict diet or workout program with it?No strict rules here. Lipozem doesn’t demand keto, low-carb, or intense exercise to “work.” That said, pairing it with a balanced diet and light movement can amplify your results. The bonus? Once inflammation drops and cravings calm down, many users naturally eat healthier without forcing it. Where should I buy Lipozem to make sure it’s real?Only buy from the official Lipozem website. It’s not available in stores or on Amazon, and that’s intentional. Ordering directly means you’re getting the genuine product, eligible for the 180-day money-back guarantee, and protected from knockoffs or expired supplements. Final Verdict: Is Lipozem Worth It in 2025? Let’s Get Real. Okay, let’s cut through the fluff. If you’ve been bouncing between trendy detox teas, metabolism “boosters,” and overpriced diet apps that barely deliver, you’re not alone. The weight loss industry is overflowing with gimmicks—and honestly, most of us are over it. Enter Lipozem—the inflammation-fighting, Triple-BHB-powered supplement that’s actually getting attention for the right reasons. It’s not promising overnight abs or asking you to live on lettuce. Instead, it’s designed to address what real science is now calling the root of stubborn fat: inflamed, locked fat cells that refuse to budge, no matter how many salads or spin classes you throw at them. The buzz? Verified reviews from 2025 say Lipozem is helping users reclaim their metabolism, fight bloat, boost energy, and finally break past those frustrating plateaus—all without the sketchy side effects of stimulant-packed formulas.

Title: Coca-Cola Should 'Continue to Outperform' Amid Tariff Uncertainty, JPM Says

Coca-Cola (KO) is well-positioned amid continuing uncertainty in the market over the Trump administration's tariffs, JPMorgan analysts said in a Monday note. The analysts lifted their price target to $78 from $74 previously, keeping their "overweight" rating in a note previewing the soda maker's first-quarter results, which are set to be released on April 29. The new price target brings JPMorgan analysts closer to the analyst consensus of $78.58 compiled by Visible Alpha, as they are among 11 other analysts with a "buy" rating, while just one has a "hold" rating on the stock. "While KO is not immune to tariffs and macro headwinds, it is a relatively more defensive stock that will likely deliver among the highest [organic sales growth] in our coverage universe in 2025," the JPMorgan analysts wrote. They lowered their estimates for Coca-Cola's first-quarter and full-year earnings and sales growth due to a "moderating consumption environment in the U.S.," which they expect to be partially offset by a softening dollar. The company has relatively limited exposure risk to tariffs, as the analysts said Coca-Cola's largest risks are likely imported fruit juice and aluminum. They said Coca-Cola's management "doesn't see a potential impact" from possible aluminum inflation that could "derail its outlook." Noting the consumer staple market will be "highly dependent on the macro and tariff situation," the analysts said that "if the current environment continues, we believe KO will continue to outperform peers and the broader market.” Coca-Cola shares were down less than 1% to $72.77 at Monday's close amid a broader market sell-off. They have gained 16% since the start of the year.

Title: Wall Street And The Dollar Tumble As Investors Retreat Further From The United States

Full Content:
NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street weakened Monday as investors worldwide get more skeptical about U.S. investments because of President Donald Trump’s trade war and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which are shaking the traditional order. The S&P 500 sank 2.4% in another wipeout. That yanked the index that’s at the center of many 401(k) accounts 16% below its record set two months ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971 points, or 2.5%, while losses for Tesla and Nvidia helped drag the Nasdaq composite down 2.6%. Perhaps more worryingly, U.S. government bonds and the value of the U.S. dollar also sank as prices retreated across U.S. markets. It’s an unusual move because Treasurys and the dollar have historically strengthened during episodes of nervousness. This time around, though, it’s policies directly from Washington that are causing the fear and potentially weakening their reputations as some of the world’s safest investments. Trump continued his tough talk on global trade as economists and investors continue to say his stiff proposed tariffs could cause a recession if they’re not rolled back. U.S. talks last week with Japan failed to reach a quick deal that could lower tariffs and protect the economy, and they’re seen as a “test case,” according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. “The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules,” Trump said in all capitalized letters on his Truth Social Network. He also said that “the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics,” likewise in all caps. Trump has recently focused more on China, the world’s second-largest economy, which has also been keeping up its rhetoric. China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States “at the expense of China’s interest” as Japan, South Korea and others try to negotiate agreements. “If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Also hanging over the market are worries about Trump’s anger at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump last week criticized Powell again for not cutting interest rates sooner to give the economy more juice. The Fed has been resistant to lowering rates too quickly because it does not want to allow inflation to reaccelerate after slowing nearly all the way down to its 2% goal from more than 9% three years ago. Trump talked Monday about a slowdown for the U.S. economy that could be coming unless “Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” A move by Trump to fire Powell would likely send a bolt of fear through financial markets. While Wall Street loves lower rates, largely because they boost stock prices, the bigger worry would be that a less independent Fed would be less effective at keeping inflation under control. Such a move could further weaken, if not kill, the United States’ reputation as the world’s safest place to keep cash. All the uncertainty striking pillars at the center of financial markets means some investors say they’re having to rethink the fundamentals of how to invest. “We can no longer extrapolate from past trends or rely on long-term assumptions to anchor portfolios,” strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a report. “The distinction between tactical and strategic asset allocation is blurred. Instead, we need to constantly reassess the long-term trajectory and be dynamic with asset allocation as we learn more about the future state of the global system.” That in turn could push investors outside the United States to keep more of their money in their home markets, according to the strategists led by Jean Boivin. On Wall Street, Big Tech stocks helped lead indexes lower ahead of their latest earnings reports due later this week. Tesla sank 5.7%. The electric vehicle’s stock has more than halved from its record set in December on criticism that its stock price had gone too high and that its brand has become too entwined with Elon Musk, who’s leading the U.S. government’s efforts to cut spending. Nvidia fell 4.5% for a third straight drop after disclosing that U.S. export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. They led another wipeout on Wall Street, and 92% of the stocks within the S&P 500 fell. Among the few gainers were Discover Financial Services and Capital One Financial, which climbed after the U.S. government approved their proposed merger. Discover rose 3.6%, while Capital One added 1.5%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 124.50 points to 5,158.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971.82 to 38,170.41, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 415.55 to 15,870.90. Gold also climbed to burnish its reputation as a safe-haven investment, unlike some others. In the bond market, shorter-term Treasury yields fell as investors expect the Fed to cut its main overnight interest rate later this year to support the economy. But longer-term yields rose with doubts about the United States’ standing in the global economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.40%, up from 4.34% at the end of last week and from just about 4% earlier this month. That’s a substantial move for the bond market.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/21/2025 12:53:40 PM PDT by nickcarraway The deal aligns with companies across Hollywood stepping back from DEI policies. Parent company Paramount Global is seeking regulatory approval of its proposed merger with Skydance.CBS Studios has settled a lawsuit from a script coordinator for SEAL Team, who accused parent company Paramount of carrying illegal diversity quotas that discriminate against straight white men. Lawyers for both sides on Friday informed the court of a deal to settle the case. They noted that the “action and all claims and defenses asserted therein, be dismissed with prejudice,” meaning the lawsuit can’t be refiled, according to the filing. Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed. The settlement aligns with companies across Hollywood rethinking diversity, equity and inclusion policies amid a larger retreat from initiatives under that label in the private sector driven by the government. That includes Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount, which earlier this year eliminated staffing goals tied to race, ethnicity, sex and gender. The company also stopped collecting gender and diversity data for most U.S. job applicants and tying its employee incentive program to DEI goals, pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court striking down race-conscious admissions in universities and federal mandates that “require changes in the way our company approaches inclusion moving forward.” Related Stories Kathy Bates as Matty with Skye P. Marshall in the season finale. TV "Who the Hell Are You?": 'Matlock' Creator Answers Key Questions From Finale, Teasing Season 2 Padma Lakshmi TV Padma Lakshmi to Host Cooking Competition Series for CBS Some of those policies came under the spotlight last year when SEAL Team script coordinator Brian Beneker alleged in a lawsuit filed in California federal court that he was repeatedly denied a staff writer job after the implementation of an “illegal policy of race and sex balancing” that allegedly promoted the hiring of less qualified applicants from certain groups, namely those who identify as minorities, LGBTQ or women. He sought at least $500,000, as well as a court order making him a full-time producer on the series and barring the further use of discriminatory hiring practices. The court overseeing the case later rebuffed Paramount’s bid to dismiss the case. The lawsuit was settled as Paramount Global continues to seek regulatory approval of its proposed merger with Skydance. FCC commissioner Brendan Carr, who sent a letter to Comcast in February saying that he was investigating DEI policies, has asserted his authority over the sale due to the transfer of broadcast licenses. The agency continues to investigate CBS News’ handling of a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Beneker was represented by America First Legal Foundation, a conservative group founded by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The firm, which was joined by JW Howard Attorneys, has brought federal complaints against major companies, including Starbucks, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock, arguing that corporate diversity and hiring practices run afoul of civil rights laws. It has targeted allegedly discriminatory hiring quotas at Disney, specifically a provision requiring that at least half of producer and writing staff come from underrepresented group that the company rolled back earlier this year. The settlement was reached as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to campaign against DEI programs in the media and entertainment sector. Carr in March urged the agency’s enforcement arm to open an investigation into Disney and ABC over whether the companies maintains discriminatory policies through racial quotas, among other things. Paramount and CBS declined to comment. Lawyers for Beneker didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

FCC commissioner Brendan Carr, who sent a letter to Comcast in February saying that he was investigating DEI policies, has asserted his authority over the sale due to the transfer of broadcast licenses. The agency continues to investigate CBS News’ handling of a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Beneker was represented by America First Legal Foundation, a conservative group founded by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The firm, which was joined by JW Howard Attorneys, has brought federal complaints against major companies, including Starbucks, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock, arguing that corporate diversity and hiring practices run afoul of civil rights laws. It has targeted allegedly discriminatory hiring quotas at Disney, specifically a provision requiring that at least half of producer and writing staff come from underrepresented group that the company rolled back earlier this year. The settlement was reached as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to campaign against DEI programs in the media and entertainment sector. Carr in March urged the agency’s enforcement arm to open an investigation into Disney and ABC over whether the companies maintains discriminatory policies through racial quotas, among other things. Paramount and CBS declined to comment. Lawyers for Beneker didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Title: Pundit Explains Why He Believes Ripple’s XRP Price Has Already Been Determined
URL: https://zycrypto.com/pundit-explains-why-he-believes-ripples-xrp-price-has-already-been-determined/
Time Published: 2025-04-21T18:53:53Z
Full Content:
In a bold claim that has sparked debate in the crypto community, market pundit Versan Alajjarah asserts that XRP’s future price has already been predetermined by major financial institutions long before retail investors entered the market. Alajjarah’s argument comes even as XRP price continues to lag despite Ripple’s recent major wins like the XRP legal battle with the SEC and expanding ecosystem. In a recent article titled “XRP Price Already Set: What Global Institutions Know,” the pundit outlined a theory comparing XRP’s current situation to traditional pre-IPO processes. “The price of XRP has already been determined,” he stated, a position he’s maintained since 2022. According to his analysis, just as large institutional investors negotiate share prices before a company goes public, global financial entities like central banks, JP Morgan, BlackRock, and the IMF have already established XRP’s true value behind closed doors. “XRP is being adopted by the world’s largest financial players behind closed doors, and they have already agreed on a price for the technology’s use in their financial systems,” Alajjarah explained. He pointed to Ripple’s integration into financial systems of various central banks worldwide as evidence of this pre-arranged adoption. The Swan Capital founder further distinguishes between two XRP price realities. First, the institutional price, which is allegedly set through private negotiations for cross-border transactions and blockchain interoperability, and the retail price, which is currently subject to market speculation and manipulation. Notably, while he didn’t specify the exact set figure, he suggested the institutional price will “far exceed” current market values, potentially reaching “three to four-digit ranges” to facilitate multi-trillion-dollar financial transactions globally. “Central banks and large financial institutions aren’t going to transact in XRP at 50 cents. They need stability and confidence in the price when using XRP for large-scale settlements,” he noted, adding, “Retail price action is irrelevant to the larger institutional game already underway.” He believes XRP’s true value will only become apparent once its full role in the global financial system is realized. That said, the theory has generated mixed reactions within the crypto community. Blockchain enthusiast Jason Vonhunk rejected the prediction, stating, “It will never be triple digits. Ever. $100 = $10 trillion market cap. That’s Bitcoin’s entire global market cap, six times.” Others supported Alajjarah’s view, with one commenter noting, “Having done an IPO and capital raises on the stock market, this is the long-term reality, eventually.” Meanwhile, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently confirmed that a Ripple IPO is “possible, but not a priority.” However, although no official timeline has been set, speculation around a potential year-end IPO continues to grow. For XRP holders, a Ripple IPO could be a double-edged sword—bringing both opportunity and uncertainty. On the positive side, going public would likely generate significant buzz and credibility for Ripple, potentially accelerating adoption of its technology and XRP’s price.

Title: Strategy Increases Total Holdings To 538,200 BTC As Over 13,000 Institutions Are Exposed To The Bitcoin-Buying Firm

Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has revealed that over 13,000 institutions now have direct exposure to the firm. The Bitcoin treasury company’s most recent acquisition of 6,556 BTC brought its total holdings to 538,200 BTC, valued at over $46 billion. Strategy’s stock (MSTR) is quickly becoming one of the key on-ramps into Bitcoin, not just for Wall Street but also for everyday investors, pension funds, and institutions worldwide. “Based on public data as of Q1 2025, over 13,000 institutions and 814,000 retail accounts hold MSTR directly. An estimated 55 million beneficiaries have indirect exposure through ETFs, mutual funds, pensions, and insurance portfolios,” Saylor wrote on X. Strategy’s increasing popularity among retail and institutional investors is noteworthy as the firm siphons capital from traditional financial markets and into Bitcoin. Increased capital flows translate into Strategy amassing more BTC, gradually boosting the price of the supply-capped crypto. Ironically, Wall Street giant Vanguard Group, known for its unwavering anti-Bitcoin stance, is still the top MSTR holder with over 16 million shares, despite reducing its stake by 6% in Q4 2024. Some other top institutions that hold Strategy stock include BlackRock, UBS Asset Management AG, State Street Global Advisors, Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management, and Morgan Stanley. As reported by ZyCrypto, Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) joined the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index in December 2024 after witnessing tremendous gains during that year. The MSTR stock has gained 5.73% on a year-to-date basis. Interestingly, it has outperformed the Nasdaq-100, which is down 13%. Meanwhile, Strategy bought an additional 6,556 Bitcoin for $555.8 million between April 14 and April 20, according to a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. $MSTR has acquired 6,556 BTC for ~$555.8 million at ~$84,785 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 12.1% YTD 2025. As of 4/20/2025, @Strategy holds 538,200 $BTC acquired for ~$36.47 billion at ~$67,766 per bitcoin. https://t.co/YxUq6mHzca The purchase was funded through proceeds from the sale of its own shares to investors via ongoing stock sale programs. Between April 14 and April 20, Strategy sold 1.76 million shares of its Class A common stock (MSTR) and over 91,000 shares of a preferred stock series (STRK), raising a total of $555.5 million to fund the Bitcoin buy. The latest purchase pushes Strategy’s total stash to 538,200 BTC, purchased at an average price of $67,766 per coin. Overall, the Saylor-led company has spent $36.47 billion implementing its Bitcoin strategy. The price of Bitcoin is currently hovering at around $87,000. At that price, Strategy’s BTC cache is worth around $46.8 billion, marking a paper profit of approximately $10 billion. The company is committed to boosting its holdings after setting a goal of raising a whopping $42 billion by the end of 2027 to scoop up more BTC, regardless of market conditions.

My eating habits were erratic — sometimes skipping meals, other times stress-eating at night. By the time I turned 42, I felt uncomfortable in my own body. I tried keto, intermittent fasting, even joined a gym, but nothing stuck — and the bloating was awful.” “A friend introduced me to Slim Jaro and the Pink Salt Trick. I was intrigued because I’d never heard of pink salt being used for fat-burning. I started with the 3-bottle pack. Within the first week, I noticed my late-night cravings had vanished. That alone was a huge win!” “By week 3, my energy levels improved. I didn’t need my usual 3 cups of coffee to stay awake. The scale started moving — slowly but surely. I lost 9 lbs in the first month without any intense workout — just walking and drinking more water.” “Fast forward to 3 months, and I had dropped 28 lbs. My jeans fit again. My confidence returned. My digestion improved. For the first time in years, I looked forward to being in front of the camera.” Biggest Win: Reduced bloating, better sleep, and a new wardrobe.Advice to Others: “Consistency is key. Take it daily and trust the process.” 2. Carlos M. – Miami, Florida, USA Age: 36 | Starting Weight: 210 lbs → Final Weight: 188 lbsDuration: 2.5 Months | Total Weight Loss: 22 lbsOccupation: IT Project Manager “Slim Jaro Helped Me Beat My Tech-Desk Lifestyle & Regain My Health.” “I’ve always worked behind a screen. Sitting for 8-10 hours daily and ordering fast food was my norm. I hit my heaviest at 210 lbs. My energy was tanking, and I felt sluggish by midday. I didn’t have time for long gym sessions or prepping meals. That’s when I looked into natural fat burners and discovered SlimJaro.” “The science behind the ‘Pink Salt Trick’ intrigued me — especially how it activates thermogenesis and supports hormone balance. I was skeptical but hopeful. I went for the 3-month bundle, and I’m glad I did.” “Week 1: I had more energy. No jitters, just clean focus.Week 2: I noticed my belly was less bloated.Week 4: I lost 11 lbs. I couldn’t believe it.” “The appetite control was a game-changer. I stopped snacking mindlessly. By the end of 2.5 months, I dropped 22 lbs. My wife was shocked.

I felt heavy and tired all the time. Most supplements available locally made me nauseous or bloated. I needed something gentle yet effective.” “Slim Jaro was trending in a health group I follow. The ingredient list caught my attention — it was natural, vegan, and backed by reviews. I ordered through their international shipping option. Delivery took 9 days.” “The changes were quick: “No crashes, no mood swings. Just steady progress. I even saw improvements in my skin and energy. My work productivity went up too.” Biggest Win: Balanced hormones and energy during her menstrual cycle.Advice to Others: “Be patient. Even a little walk + SlimJaro goes a long way.” 4.

Hormonal changes made it worse — I was tired, sluggish, and stuck in a body I didn’t recognize. I tried everything: Pilates, meal plans, even hired a personal trainer. But the progress was slow and draining.” “One day, I saw a before-and-after of a mom using Slim Jaro. I immediately researched it. The formulation impressed me, especially its focus on metabolism and hormone balance. I gave it a shot.” “First month: “Second month: “The best part? I did it without extreme dieting or intense exercise.

My doctor warned me my blood pressure and cholesterol were borderline high. I needed to act — fast. Dieting felt punishing, and I didn’t want stimulants that made my heart race.” “That’s when my daughter told me about SlimJaro. I liked that it was plant-based, didn’t have caffeine, and had a 180-day money-back guarantee.

Let’s explore how SlimJaro tailors’ benefits across genders: For Women: Supporting Hormonal Harmony and Fat Burn Women often face weight-related challenges due to hormonal fluctuations caused by pregnancy, PCOS, menopause, or thyroid issues. These hormonal changes can result in increased appetite, slow metabolism, and fat retention—especially around the hips, belly, and thighs. SlimJaro helps regulate female-specific hormones like oestrogen and leptin, supporting: Many women experience an increased sense of self-control around food, less bloating, and a leaner midsection within weeks of starting SlimJaro. For Men: Muscle Retention and Belly Fat Reduction Men typically store fat in the abdominal region and often experience reduced testosterone and slowed metabolism as they age. SlimJaro supports metabolic restoration and natural hormone production that helps men: Men often report noticeable waist reduction, improved athletic performance, and more energy to stay active after starting Slim Jaro. Unisex Performance: One Formula, Universal Results SlimJaro’s formula is not gender-biased. It is suitable for everyone aged 18+, regardless of gender identity, provided they are not pregnant or nursing. Its natural, inclusive formulation makes it ideal for couples trying to get healthier together. The Origin of SlimJaro: From Research to Real Results The story of Slim Jaro starts not in a marketing boardroom but in a clinical wellness research lab where scientists and nutritionists focused on the root causes of weight gain and metabolic dysfunction. Through years of trials and testing, they identified a critical issue shared by most overweight individuals: a sluggish metabolism and poor fat oxidation. What fascinated the creators of SlimJaro was a discovery based on mineral activation and hormonal stimulation using trace elements found in Himalayan pink salt. This finding was coined the “Pink Salt Trick” – a powerful method of supporting metabolic efficiency and controlling hunger through a natural mechanism. But rather than making people rely on pink salt alone, the team incorporated this trick into a holistic supplement that combines modern nutrition with ancient wisdom. Thus, Slim Jaro was born – a capsule-based product that’s easy to use, gentle on the system, and powerful enough to accelerate fat burn naturally. The product’s creators wanted SlimJaro to break boundaries – not just in terms of scientific innovation, but also in accessibility. That’s why Slim Jaro was formulated to suit people of all dietary backgrounds. It’s non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, and free from harsh chemicals or stimulants. Since its launch, SlimJaro has exploded in popularity due to word-of-mouth success stories. Users from diverse backgrounds began to see visible results within weeks, driving a surge in global demand. What began as a niche wellness innovation is now a multinational best-seller, with a loyal customer base in over 25 countries. In many ways, SlimJaro is more than just a product – it’s a movement, reshaping how people view weight loss. It doesn’t push starvation diets or endless hours at the gym. Instead, it offers real results through metabolic support, hormonal balance, and appetite control – all rooted in natural ingredients. How Slim Jaro Works: The Science Behind the Magic? At its core, SlimJaro addresses the three main barriers to weight loss: Each capsule of SlimJaro is infused with ingredients that trigger a chain reaction in the body, beginning with metabolic activation. The Pink Salt Trick acts as the ignition, helping to stimulate thermogenesis – the process by which your body burns calories to produce heat. Once thermogenesis is activated, the ingredients in Slim Jaro mobilize stored fat, converting it into usable energy. This not only reduces fat storage but also boosts vitality, so you feel more active, alert, and motivated throughout the day. SlimJaro also plays a role in balancing key weight-related hormones, particularly leptin and ghrelin. Leptin controls satiety (the feeling of fullness), while ghrelin triggers hunger. When these hormones are out of balance, it leads to overeating and emotional cravings. SlimJaro helps stabilize this hormonal interplay, which leads to better control over portion sizes and reduced emotional eating. In addition, the supplement contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents that improve digestion and reduce bloating. Many users report feeling lighter, less bloated, and more regular within days of starting Slim Jaro. Importantly, SlimJaro works with your body – not against it. There are no jittery side effects like those found in caffeine-heavy fat burners. Instead, it promotes steady, sustainable fat loss by enhancing your body’s natural ability to process fat and use it as fuel. SlimJaro Ingredients Breakdown: What’s Inside the Formula? Slim Jaro isn't just another trendy fat burner—it’s a scientifically crafted metabolic support formula based on natural, clinically reviewed ingredients that target fat burning, appetite control, hormonal balance, and energy enhancement. Let’s explore each key ingredient in Slim Jaro, understand its function, and how it contributes to healthy and sustainable weight loss.

Slim Jaro Benefits Explained: How It Transforms Your Body from the Inside Out Slim Jaro is more than a weight loss pill — it’s a holistic health enhancer designed to activate your body’s natural fat-burning systems, restore metabolic balance, suppress unhealthy cravings, and elevate daily energy levels. Let’s take a deep dive into the core benefits of SlimJaro, exploring how each one works, what makes it effective, and why it has become a global favorite for men and women seeking safe, natural transformation. 1. Accelerates Fat Burning Through Thermogenesis How It Works: Slim Jaro contains thermogenic agents like Green Tea Extract (EGCG), Cayenne Pepper (Capsaicin), and Black Pepper Extract (Piperine) that increase your core body temperature. This process, known as thermogenesis, forces your body to burn more calories—even when at rest. The Result: You experience faster calorie burning, even while sitting or doing light activities. Over time, this contributes to a significant reduction in stored body fat, particularly in the midsection. 2. Reduces Appetite and Controls Cravings How It Works: SlimJaro targets the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for hunger, using natural appetite-suppressing ingredients like Garcinia Cambogia, Apple Cider Vinegar, and African Mango Extract. The Result: You naturally eat less without feeling deprived. This leads to a calorie deficit, the key to consistent weight loss. 3. Balances Hormones That Influence Weight Gain How It Works: SlimJaro addresses hormonal imbalances that are often the hidden culprits behind stubborn fat—especially belly and hip fat. Ingredients like Ashwagandha and Pink Himalayan Salt support adrenal function and hormonal harmony. The Result: By correcting hormonal disruptions, Slim Jaro helps the body return to a fat-burning state, making it easier to lose weight even after plateaus or menopause. 4. Boosts Energy Without Caffeine or Jitters How It Works: Unlike stimulant-based fat burners that cause energy crashes, SlimJaro uses a clean energy formula derived from metabolic enhancers like Green Tea Extract, Cayenne Pepper, and Chromium Picolinate. The Result: You feel awake, focused, and ready to move, without the highs and crashes of sugar or coffee. This energy boost also encourages physical activity, further enhancing weight loss. [Trusted by Thousands Worldwide] - Read SlimJaro Reviews & Real Customer Complaints! 5. Supports Healthy Digestion and Reduces Bloating How It Works: A sluggish digestive system can slow metabolism and promote bloating. Slim Jaro includes ingredients like Apple Cider Vinegar, Pink Himalayan Salt, and Piperine to improve digestive enzyme function. The Result: Better digestion = less bloating, smoother metabolism, and faster nutrient absorption, all of which contribute to a flatter stomach and enhanced fat-burning. 6. Improves Sleep and Reduces Stress-Eating How It Works: Emotional and late-night eating are often driven by high cortisol and poor sleep. SlimJaro addresses both with Ashwagandha, an adaptogen known to calm the nervous system and regulate stress hormones. The Result: You wake up refreshed and less prone to stress-based snacking, which can make or break a fat-loss journey. 7. Supports Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health How It Works: SlimJaro supports healthy heart function and metabolic performance by improving lipid profiles, reducing inflammation, and enhancing blood flow through ingredients like Garcinia, ACV, and Green Tea. The Result: Not only do you look better, but your heart, arteries, and metabolic system function better too, supporting long-term wellness. 8. Increases Insulin Sensitivity and Blood Sugar Control How It Works: Fat loss becomes difficult when insulin resistance is high. SlimJaro fights this with Chromium Picolinate, ACV, and African Mango, all of which help stabilize blood sugar and improve insulin response. The Result: You experience fewer sugar crashes, more stable energy, and a reduction in fat storage, especially around the waist. 9. Enhances Nutrient Absorption for Better Results How It Works: Even the best supplement won’t work if your body can’t absorb it. SlimJaro includes Piperine, which amplifies the bioavailability of other ingredients by as much as 2000%. The Result: You get the full benefits of every capsule, making Slim Jaro more effective than standalone extracts. 10. Works for All Body Types and Lifestyles How It Works: SlimJaro was created with universal metabolic triggers that don’t rely on gender, specific diets, or age groups.

Users across the world—ages 18 to 70+—have reported significant benefits. 11. Safe, Natural, and Non-GMO How It Works: Every capsule of SlimJaro is made in GMP-certified, FDA-registered facilities with third-party testing to ensure safety and potency. The ingredients are free from synthetic binders, preservatives, or toxic fillers. The Result: A clean formula you can take daily without fear of long-term health risks or side effects. 12.

Title: As Stocks Tumble Again, Donald Lashes Out At 'Major Loser' Jerome Powell

The U.S. dollar has fallen to a three-year low, and stocks are tumbling again today. Meanwhile, Donald weighed in to blame his tariff tantrums Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, while casting a conspiracy theory involving "Sleepy Joe Biden" and Kamala Harris. '“Preemptive Cuts” in Interest Rates are being called for by many," Lumpy wrote on Truth Social. "With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden’s egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other “things” trending down, there is virtually No Inflation." Fact check: Excluding food and energy, prices rose 2.8% in March. According to a study from SmartAsset, "While prices of fruits, vegetables and dairy products either increased or decreased depending on the location, eggs, meat and poultry soared almost unanimously, reaching over 9% or higher than just a year before — tripling the general rate of inflation." "With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates," It added. "NOW. Europe has already “lowered” seven times. Powell has always been “To Late,” except when it came to the Election period when he lowered in order to help Sleepy Joe Biden, later Kamala, get elected. How did that work out?" To late, eh? The Stable Genius™ is referring to the European Central Bank (ECB) lowering interest rates for the seventh time since last June. However, the ECB took this action in response to concerns about trade tensions and their potential impact on the economic recovery. It's because of Donald's tariffs. Powell said last week that inflation is likely to go up as the cost of US tariffs makes its way to consumers. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC that he believes the U.S. economy has weakened to the point where growth may turn negative. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said. He's right. “The Street does not care anymore about words and ‘deal progress’ comments,” Wedbush analysts said on Sunday. “The economic damage done from this Trump back and forth tariff plan has likely pushed the economy towards a recession path already as cap ex [has been] halted across the board, hiring plans paused, price increase worries, and supply chain shock/chaos has sparked a level of uncertainty in the US not seen since Covid days.” We're going to have to hear his whining for over 3 1/2 years more. He will never stop. He's only been in office for a couple of months, and look what he's done to the global economy already.

Apple and Amazon have lost $1 trillion combined since the president’s “liberation day” tariff plan was announced earlier this month Wall Street is off to a brutal start to the week, with the Nasdaq dropping more than 3% a few hours into trading on Monday morning, as the markets continue to grapple with President Trump’s tariffs and his criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 3.29%, the S&P 500 was down 2.97%, and the Dow Jones had dropped 2.84% by 12:15 E.T. on Monday. Several major media and tech companies like Apple and Disney have taken hits to their share price as part of the downturn — more on that in a minute — and from a macro standpoint, all three major indexes are down 10% or more since the president announced his “liberation day” tariff plan on Apr. 2. Since then, the markets have been compared innumerable times to riding a rollercoaster, with wild daily swings becoming the norm the past few weeks. The Trump Administration on Friday signaled it was getting closer to working out a trade deal with China, although nothing concrete has been announced. The markets appear to have wanted a bit more clarity by the time trading started on Monday, especially as earnings season has kicked off. Last week, Netflix reported sales of $10.5 billion in the first quarter — up 12% year-over-year. Netflix’s stock is up 2.15% on Monday to $994 per share. A number of other big tech and media companies, including Meta, Spotify, Comcast and Disney, are set to report their first quarter earnings over the next few weeks. Something else that likely did not boost investor confidence on Monday was the president slamming Powell as a “major loser” who should cut interest rates. Apple, the world’s most valuable company, is down 3.05% on Monday. Since Apr. 2, the tech giant has seen $700 billion shaved from its market cap, as investors have worried about the tariff on Chinese imports hitting Apple devices. Amazon is down 3.49% on Monday and has had its valuation drop from $2.07 trillion to $177 trillion since the start of April. And Google, which was found to have an illegal monopoly for the second time in less than a year last week, was down 2.88% a few hours into trading. Meta, meanwhile, is down 3.68%; The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is currently facing its own antitrust lawsuit from the government. Here is how a number of other media and tech stocks are performing: Comcast: -1.82% Roku: -0.74% Amazon: -3.49% Disney: -1.52% WB Discovery: -3.80% Snap Inc.: -2.84% Paramount: -0.87% Spotify: -1.80% Live Nation: -2.80% As for earnings, check TheWrap on Thursday morning for a look at how Comcast’s Q1 went, then check back on Thursday afternoon for a look at how Alphabet, Google and YouTube’s parent company, performed.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. A general view of the Microsoft headquarters in Shanghai, China, on April 8, 2025, as rumors ... More circulate on social media about Microsoft ceasing operations in China and laying off tech workers in China. (Photo by Ying Tang/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The headlines are full of Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU madness, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) China risk, and Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) margin implosion - but while the rest of the Mag 7 dance on a tightrope, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is quietly setting up for what could be a 20–25% upside, putting a $500 price tag within reach. As an aside, do deficits matter? See: The U.S. Trade Deficit Math In Four Lines. You don’t need hype when you have compounding cash flows, irreplaceable products, and a balance sheet strong enough to fund a small country. This isn’t a meme trade - it’s a fortress stock. It’s hard not to have it in your portfolio. And if you do not want to undertake the painstaking and meticulous process of identifying the right portfolio mix, consider our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s break down why smart money could rotate into Microsoft - and fast. Let’s start with this: Microsoft generates $100 Bil+, in fact > $115 Bil , in operating profit annually. So you have a company that’s growing faster than Apple, is cheaper than Nvidia, has better margin than Amazon, and is less volatile than Tesla. Why won’t you have it in your portfolio? Unlike Apple or Nvidia, Microsoft doesn’t ship chips or assemble phones in China. And that matters. In a de-globalizing world, Microsoft’s geopolitical footprint is a superpower. Right now, Nvidia and Meta have stolen the spotlight. But valuations are stretched, and institutional funds know rotation is coming. This is what positioning before the crowd looks like. Microsoft is exciting, isn’t it? But investing in a single stock can be risky no matter what. We diversify away this risk while giving upside exposure in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The deal aligns with companies across Hollywood stepping back from DEI policies. Parent company Paramount Global is seeking regulatory approval of its proposed merger with Skydance. By Winston Cho CBS Studios has settled a lawsuit from a script coordinator for SEAL Team, who accused parent company Paramount of carrying illegal diversity quotas that discriminate against straight white men. Lawyers for both sides on Friday informed the court of a deal to settle the case. They noted that the “action and all claims and defenses asserted therein, be dismissed with prejudice,” meaning the lawsuit can’t be refiled, according to the filing. Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed. The settlement aligns with companies across Hollywood rethinking diversity, equity and inclusion policies amid a larger retreat from initiatives under that label in the private sector driven by the government. That includes Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount, which earlier this year eliminated staffing goals tied to race, ethnicity, sex and gender. The company also stopped collecting gender and diversity data for most U.S. job applicants and tying its employee incentive program to DEI goals, pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court striking down race-conscious admissions in universities and federal mandates that “require changes in the way our company approaches inclusion moving forward.” Related Stories Business Can '60 Minutes' Prized Independence Survive a Major Deal? TV 'Einstein' Procedural, 'DMV' Comedy Land Series Orders at CBS Some of those policies came under the spotlight last year when SEAL Team script coordinator Brian Beneker alleged in a lawsuit filed in California federal court that he was repeatedly denied a staff writer job after the implementation of an “illegal policy of race and sex balancing” that allegedly promoted the hiring of less qualified applicants from certain groups, namely those who identify as minorities, LGBTQ or women. He sought at least $500,000, as well as a court order making him a full-time producer on the series and barring the further use of discriminatory hiring practices. The court overseeing the case later rebuffed Paramount’s bid to dismiss the case. Paramount Global and CBS Studios have agreed to a settlement in a lawsuit America First Legal brought on behalf of our client Brian Beneker. America First Legal is pleased to see Paramount and CBS publicly back off their DEI requirements and return to merit-based considerations. Diversity quotas that discriminate on the basis of race are unlawful. Others in the entertainment industry should take note. The lawsuit was settled as Paramount Global continues to seek regulatory approval of its proposed merger with Skydance. FCC commissioner Brendan Carr, who sent a letter to Comcast in February saying that he was investigating DEI policies, has asserted his authority over the sale due to the transfer of broadcast licenses. The agency continues to investigate CBS News’ handling of a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Beneker was represented by America First Legal Foundation, a conservative group founded by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The firm, which was joined by JW Howard Attorneys, has brought federal complaints against major companies, including Starbucks, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock, arguing that corporate diversity and hiring practices run afoul of civil rights laws. It has targeted allegedly discriminatory hiring quotas at Disney, specifically a provision requiring that at least half of producer and writing staff come from underrepresented group that the company rolled back earlier this year. In a statement, Nick Barry, a lawyer for Beneker, said, America First Legal is pleased to see Paramount and CBS publicly back off their DEI requirements and return to merit-based considerations.” He added, “Diversity quotas that discriminate on the basis of race are unlawful. Others in the entertainment industry should take note.” The settlement was reached as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to campaign against DEI programs in the media and entertainment sector. Carr in March urged the agency’s enforcement arm to open an investigation into Disney and ABC over whether the companies maintains discriminatory policies through racial quotas, among other things. Paramount and CBS declined to comment. Lawyers for Beneker didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

As markets swirl amid tariffs and trade war concerns, one company is looking rather recession-proof: Netflix (NFLX+2.09%). The company was one of the rare bright spots in trading Monday, rising almost 2% after delivering a blockbuster first quarter that had experts comparing the company with Big Tech instead of Big Media. Netflix posted nearly $3 billion in profit and a 31.7% operating margin on $10.5 billion in revenue. Netflix is outperforming both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices as of midday Monday, which had declines of 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively.​ The company is up 12% year-to-date, while the S&P and Nasdaq are down 12.5% and 18%. An analyst report from William Blair said Netflix is “currently not experiencing economic headwinds with stable retention” after its strong quarter. The financial services firm maintained its “outperform” rating for Netflix’s stock. “Netflix is relatively more insulated from the recent market turmoil because it is not overly exposed to tariffs and will be relatively resilient in any potential future economic downturn,” analysts Ralph Schackart and Jack Brenczewski wrote in the report. “Overall, Netflix remains well positioned to remain a secular streaming winner, in our view, and we believe longer term it will continue to have pricing power.” The report’s key takeaways included that price hikes are performing in line with expectations and retention is strong and stable; that the advertising business is successfully scaling; and that Netflix’s large, monetizable audience should allow the company to maintain its edge over competitors. “Netflix disclosed its audience is larger than 700 million people, with more than two-thirds of the audience outside the United States,” analysts wrote. “Given its content diversification strategy of making original content for global countries, this should allow the company to maintain its scaled competitive advantage.” Netflix expects its second quarter revenue to be slightly above Wall Street’s expectation at roughly $11 billion. Its 2025 revenue is still expected to be between $43.5 and $44.5 billion. Netflix does have areas where it can improve, however, according to the William Blair analysts. Namely: its advertising product. Earlier this month, the company rolled out its ads suite in the U.S. and will start rolling its product out to other advertising markets. “In our view, this is important because the advertisers we have spoken with suggest Netflix needed to improve its advertising platform. The new platform will provide advertisers with better measurement and targeting, new ad formats, and advanced programmatic capabilities,” the analysts wrote. The company is looking at other ways to expand, too. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in an earnings call Thursday that video podcasts may be the next format to land on the platform, potentially pulling business from Spotify (SPOT+1.35%) and YouTube (GOOGL+1.23%). Other analysts shared William Blair’s optimism. JPMorgan Chase (JPM-0.63%) analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a client note published Sunday that “Netflix [is] playing offense, while stock remains defensive.” And Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein called the company “the cleanest story in internet” following its first quarter results.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM-0.63%) analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a client note published Sunday that “Netflix [is] playing offense, while stock remains defensive.” And Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein called the company “the cleanest story in internet” following its first quarter results.

Title: The Digital Asset Primer: On-Chain Tokenization for Payments Professionals

Time Published: 2025-04-21T15:22:04Z
Full Content:
Highlights On-chain tokenization is shifting from concept to reality, enabling real-world assets like fiat, real estate and securities to be represented as programmable digital tokens on the blockchain. Tokenization offers new capital and liquidity strategies through real-time, cross-border and programmable money movement. Despite regulatory fragmentation and digital identity concerns, adoption is growing due to tokenization’s potential for speed, cost efficiency, transparency and automation. The convenience, security and speed of digital innovation have reshaped the way businesses and individuals transact. Now, money and assets are undergoing their own fundamental transformation. It’s all happening by way of tokenization on the blockchain. On-chain tokenization is moving from concept to practice, with players like Visa, Mastercard, J.P. Morgan and other commercial banks exploring or piloting real-world tokenized payment and financial systems. For chief financial officers and corporate treasurers, tokenization isn’t just a tech issue; it could represent a capital strategy shift. As recently as Friday (April 18), Vera Capital announced a partnership with Blocksquare to tokenize “a substantial portfolio of commercial and multifamily real estate assets” across the United States, having already tokenized a $5.4 million commercial property in Fort Lauderdale. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also wants all assets to be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” At its most fundamental level, tokenization refers to representing real-world assets, such as fiat currency, deposits, securities and investment contracts, as digital tokens on a distributed ledger. These tokens can then be transferred, programmed or settled in ways traditional systems don’t allow. Tokenization isn’t a cryptocurrency play. Tokenization helps give businesses and financial services stakeholders a way to move value faster, cheaper and more securely across different networks. It’s about modernizing the movement of money and assets while democratizing investment access to institutional-grade products. See also: Stablecoin Sandwiches? Here’s What CFOs Need to Know About Crypto Jargon Unlike traditional digital assets, which are typically ledger entries in a private system (like a bank or card network), on-chain tokens are blockchain-native. They can be programmed, split, audited or transferred with a few lines of code, and often faster than traditional methods allow. These tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) can be anything: fiat currency (like dollars or euros), real estate, equities, loyalty points or invoices. Payments giants aren’t waiting on regulators to get started prototyping. Last year, Visa tested the settlement of stablecoins. J.P. Morgan’s JPM Coin is now facilitating billions of dollars in daily transactions, primarily for institutional clients. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS this month. “When we started the business in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens,” he said. “Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” As appetite grows from corporate treasurers for 24/7 programmable money, tokenization could provide tangible benefits to companies managing global supply chains, complex vendor networks or digital platforms. While tokenized payments are not a panacea, they can help to solve specific, persistent pain points in the global movement of money. Read also: 3 Things Payment Stakeholders Can All Agree on About Stablecoins Cross-border payments, treasury management and programmable contracts are among the emerging real-world use cases for on-chain RWA. Traditional correspondent banking networks are fragmented and slow. Tokenized fiat or deposits on a shared ledger allow for near-instant cross-border transfers, potentially collapsing multiday settlement windows into minutes or seconds. This is among the main benefits of stablecoins, an increasingly popular payment mechanism that involves the tokenization of fiat and other reserve backings. At the same time, multinational corporations can struggle with liquidity fragmentation across jurisdictions. Tokenized deposits can be moved 24/7 across entities or regions, enabling just-in-time funding and optimizing working capital. Blockchain-based smart contracts can also allow conditional or milestone-based payments to execute automatically, which could prove useful for trade finance, supply chains or royalty payments. Ultimately, tokenization’s benefits such as real-time liquidity, conditional payments and borderless value exchange can create competitive advantages. Two primary roadblocks to scalable utility across the enterprise are regulatory fragmentation and digital identity. Regulatory alignment remains patchy, especially across borders. Cybersecurity and smart contract auditing are still evolving. And adoption depends not just on technology, but on user trust and industry coordination. Sensitive financial data and transactions may be increasingly exposed to public scrutiny on-chain, so there’s a pressing need to address privacy and identity challenges within crypto. However, the marketplace isn’t standing still, and work is being done to overcome these challenges. For forward-thinking finance leaders, it could be worth entertaining that the next decade of payments may be built not just with APIs and rails, but with tokens, smart contracts and interoperable ledgers.

The Tysons, Virginia-based firm now owns 538,000 Bitcoin worth $47.2 billion following Bitcoin’s climb above $88,000 on Sunday, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The software firm said it scooped the asset up for an average price of $84,800 last week. Strategy said the acquisition was made using proceeds from two recent equity offerings: the firm received $548 million in proceeds by issuing Class A common shares, while Strategy also gained $8 million from the sale of its so-called perpetual “STRK” preferred stock. Uncertainty surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war has weighed on risk assets in recent weeks, as economists pencil in slower growth and higher costs for consumers in the U.S., yet Strategy has bought Bitcoin fairly consistently since mid-March. Over the past six Mondays, Strategy has said that it bought Bitcoin on five of them. The size of Strategy’s recent Bitcoin purchases has varied, however. After buying $11 million worth of Bitcoin in mid-March, it spent $1.9 billion on Bitcoin two weeks later, per Saylor Tracker. Strategy’s shares were recently trading at about $322, up 1.6% on the day, according to Nasdaq. The stock changed hands as high as $328 during pre-market trading on Monday but plunged as low as $317 after the opening bell. On Sunday, Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor noted on X, formerly Twitter, that the company isn’t a niche option for gaining exposure to Bitcoin’s price anymore. Based on public data, 13,000 institutions hold Strategy’s stock directly, along with 814,000 accounts tied to retail investors, he said. In addition, Saylor said 55 million investors have “indirect exposure through ETFs, mutual funds, pensions, and insurance portfolios. Strategy was added to the Nasdaq 100 in December, a milestone placing it within the coveted ranks of tech giants like Apple and Meta. The company may also join the S&P 500 one day, but Strategy’s lack of consistent profits is currently a barrier, based on inclusion criteria.

Title: Verizon’s consumer chief: Net neutrality ‘went literally nowhere’

Full Content:
Sowmyanarayan Sampath on the 5G race with China and the challenges of standing up to the Trump administration. by Nilay Patel Sowmyanarayan Sampath on the 5G race with China and the challenges of standing up to the Trump administration. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Verizon consumer CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath, who goes by “Sampath.” As CEO of Verizon’s consumer division, Sampath oversees the biggest part of the business: Verizon Wireless, which has more than 115 million wireless connections, and Fios, which adds another 10 million or so consumer broadband connections to the mix. That’s something like a solid third of the entire country in business with Sampath. As you’ll hear, Sampath is a longtime Verge reader, and in particular he’s been paying attention to my coverage of both 5G and the net neutrality debates for a long time. So we talked very directly about whether the huge 5G investment had actually paid off — whether the “race” we were supposedly in with China was actually worth it, and what kinds of new apps and services actually come to light. You’ll hear Sampath say that network capacity isn’t a small thing, and 5G really helped with the explosion of mobile data — although I was told we’d all be doing robot surgery in driverless cars by now. The mechanics of all that buildout are fascinating to me, regardless of the hype. Building network infrastructure takes years — everything from figuring out what spectrum to bid on to making deals for towers and running fiber to them is a huge process, and I wanted to ask Sampath how he balances all those very long-term, very tactical decisions against the decisions we all see and feel in very obvious ways, like consumer pricing. Sampath had one of the very clearest answers to the classic Decoder question about decision making here — like I said, you can tell he was very ready to be on this show. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! Sampath and I also spent a while talking about the push and pull of integrating content and applications directly into the network. That’s something that all the big wireless carriers flirted with in various ways, especially in and around the peak net neutrality debate. In 2018, AT&T bought HBO and CNN parent Time Warner, right after Verizon bought Yahoo and started something called go90. For one brief extremely weird moment there, Verizon even owned Tumblr. The goal of all these media plays was to differentiate the various networks from each other, and it basically didn’t work for anyone — even though Verizon in particular fought the various net neutrality regulations that would have prevented this sideshow in the first place. Sampath and I got pretty far into the weeds on that. You’ll hear him say he thinks no one cares about net neutrality, and, well — I disagreed with him. And while Verizon has always fought tooth and nail against the sort of “normal” regulations like net neutrality, the second Trump administration isn’t nearly as hands-off when it comes to things like holding up deals because of DEI policies — something that’s happening to Verizon right now. So I had to ask Sampath if he was going to push back on that kind of clear government overreach as hard as Verizon has pushed back in the past. This one is all kinds of wonky, because it’s two telecom nerds going at it, so some notes before we start. You’re going to hear me talk about local loop unbundling, which is when multiple internet providers can use the same fiber to reach consumers. We don’t really have it in the United States — there are not four different ISPs all competing to reach your house on the same mile of cable or fiber — but many other countries do, as a way to increase broadband competition. The other thing you’ll hear us get into is something called OpenRAN. That’s an initiative the US government committed some money to last year that’s supposed to open up competition in the broadband hardware space and get US providers off of Huawei components. It’s a little complicated, but it’s a big bet in the mobile industry, and I wanted to hear Sampath’s take on it. Okay: Verizon Consumer CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Sowmyanarayan Sampath, you’re the CEO of Verizon Consumer Group. Welcome to Decoder. Good to see you, Nilay. I am very excited to talk to you. It’s a topsy-turvy time in America, but telco stocks are doing great. Everyone needs internet service, and there’s a really interesting dynamic there that I want to explore with you. But first, we don’t get a lot of telecom CEOs on the show. It’s hard to understand how telecom companies are structured. I want to start with the Decoder question because all of these companies have been built by mergers, spinoffs, sales, and recombinations. You were the CEO of Verizon’s business unit. Now you’re the CEO of the consumer group. Explain how all of this is structured and what the Verizon consumer actually is. The way we think about it is, we are customer-facing. We have a Verizon Business group, which takes care of all businesses — small businesses, government, large enterprises, anything from Walmart down to Joe’s Pizza. We take care of that. Then everyone else is a consumer. It’s you and me in our private lives. The wireless service, the fiber service, the broadband to the home — all that’s in consumer. The consumer business is a little north of $105 billion in revenue. I’m responsible for sales, marketing, product offering, customer care, and digital. It’s an end-to-end unit getting things done. Most telcos, at least Verizon, have a common network that serves all of us. We call it the Intelligent Edge Network. It’s a single network that serves different types of underlying networks and businesses, so we don’t multiply costs in it. That’s it. It’s a pretty simple structure. Go to market for business, go to market for consumer, and a common network that is a shared service that serves all of us. I’ve spent a lot of time covering telecom companies, and in particular, wireless and mobile companies. One thing that always feels opaque to me is the differentiation that you can do to a business or a customer based on the network. This was a big fight in the net neutrality days, that you’d want to differentiate the actual network for different customers in different ways, and that has waned. When you say you go to market for the customer, are you in charge of things like pricing and promotion, or do you actually get to say, “Here’s what the network can and cannot do?” Here’s what the network can and cannot do. It’s the whole end-to-end offering, including the product. The way we think about it is that a product is a network. Look, there will always be a good operator and a non-good operator. It’s historically always been the same. For a country as large as America, you’ll always... Look at the end of the day, we and my peers use the same steel to make the towers. We use common tower companies to take care of our tower business. We use pretty similar vendors. We use Ericsson and Samsung. Some may use Nokia. There’s a commonality there. But the secret sauce is in the operations. When you’re running a network this big, how do you take care of outages? How do you plan for it? And even small things like how you design your tower or the specs you put on your tower? For example, almost all our sites have generator backup. Whenever a hurricane falls or there’s a natural disaster, our sites are up and running because we have backups on our sites. Second, we like resiliency on our sites. There will always be a better operator and not a good operator. We know it. We’ve got 25 years of experience or 30 years, depending on how you count it in the space. There will always be a gap. Now, is the gap narrowing between us and the second network? Probably yes. But there’ll always be a gap, and that’s why people always choose us for the network. If you go and ask people who’s the better network, they’ll always end up saying Verizon. We have to stay on top of it by using more AI in our operations. Self-healing networks. Spectrum is another thing. We have to keep buying a lot of spectrum to put it... There is always a case for a better operator and a better network. I think that’s the heart of my question. Verizon, as a company, in a very reductive way, has to go to the government, lease a bunch of spectrum capacity, and go to a bunch of tower operators. I always think it’s funny that the biggest one is called TowerCo. It’s just a very literal name that no one except you has to consider. You have to go to a bunch of tower companies and site operators, give them the spectrum so they can operate the towers, and lease the capacity back from them to run your network. Your competitors might be on the same infrastructure or the same sites in many cases because it’s so hard to build a cell tower in many places. Then, somehow, at the end of that, the consumer perceives Verizon’s network as the best one. That is as much a function of consumer marketing and experience… When I moved to New York in the early 2010s, everybody had a Blackberry and Verizon, and that impression has stuck with me for all this time. Maybe that’s still the case that Verizon is the best, but what happened was I moved to New York in the 2010s, and Cingular had the best network in Chicago at that time (where I moved from). Then Verizon was the best on the East Coast. I spend a lot of time thinking, “Where does that impression actually come from?” Because no customer holds two phones in their hands and says, “This one has better service.” There are two ways. One is, is it a better network, and then the other is, how do people perceive it? We talk about national networks. We are the largest network because more customers are on us, but the end of the network is a very local thing. The vast majority of our customers, I would say 60 or 70 percent of our customers, never go outside a five-cell cell site travel zone for the year. Think about it, you may have a great network in Alaska, but 70 percent of your customers are not traveling within five or six-cell sites outside their home or their workplace. It’s a very local conversation about how good you are. Of course, there are some people who travel a lot. People like me who are on the road 150 days per year. It’s a different equation. But for most people, how good is the network at home? How good is the network at work? How good is the network during their commute? And that’s what makes the experience. You cannot have national standards to do these things. A lot of it is a local game. Getting access to sites locally. Getting access to better network technology at the local level. Having people who know the network topology at the local level. It’s a very local game, this network thing. And that’s why you see Verizon tends to do well when local networks come into play. How much impact do you have on the capital expenditure of building the network itself? You have a number of customers, and the business side has a number of customers. Do you jointly show up in front of the core network team and say, “You need to build more capacity in Connecticut”? The consumer group has 85 to 90 percent of all the usage on the network. Maybe it’s a slightly stilted conversation there, but the way it works is… Network is a little bit like scotch. It takes a long time to really become good. Decisions we make today on the network tend to show up three, four, five, or seven years later down the line because there’s a huge lead time to it. You’ve got to procure the fiber, backhaul the sites, and the spectrum to do that. The way we start is by asking, “What is the network I need to deliver my customer’s needs?” And it’s at a local level. In Philadelphia, by markets, what do I know? How much share do I have? What am I going to grow? Then we take that back to the network team and say, “Based on what assets you have, what’s available? Can you deliver this?” And 9 out of 10 times, they can deliver it. The one out of 10 times they can’t, then we move our marketing plans... If they don’t have capacity, they’re not going to get capacity in this market in the next few years. The second thing is having objective metrics of network performance. For a common person, if a call drops or a network data session goes down, it’s bad. But we track it a million different ways by design. Having that common nomenclature... Back in the day, it was dropped calls. Thinking, “How many drop calls did you have?” We used to measure every single one of them, and then if a drop call happened, we used to go and do root cause analysis. Now it’s data sessions. How many data sessions do you have? When did it drop? What were the speeds? How did the signal flow? Having really good instrumentation at the local level is really important. We’ve created basically a digital twin for every single customer. Every customer has a digital twin in the network where we measure the network 24/7, and we give them a score. Nilay had a score, it’s out of 10. You can say Nilay had a 9.7 score this morning on his commute from A to B. It’s a good score. If he had a score of five, we would go and understand why the score of five happened. Every single customer is monitored 24/7, from a network performance perspective, and then we track them through the system. When you look at that kind of data at scale, you obviously have lots of customers who, I’m guessing, have lots of different scores across the board. Where’s the median? Where do you want people to be? You want people to be in the eights and nines for the vast part of their lives. Now, one of the things with the network is... A bigger issue we have to face, as an industry, is that when things work well, nobody thinks of us. When things don’t... It’s a little bit like parenting sometimes. When the kids are happy, they don’t think of us. Then, when they’re less than happy, they think of us. It’s a little bit like that, because 90-something percent of the time, the network works flawlessly. Whether we’re discussing the fiber in the home or the wireless network. And we are largely forgotten, which is good. But when it doesn’t work, all the emotions come out in front. We are trying to solve for that one percent where the network doesn’t work, or we’ve disappointed the customer. Most of our work is isolating where it doesn’t work. Because where it works, we know it, and we just have to let the machine run its course. We’ve talked a lot about the mobile network. You also have oversight of Fios, right? The fiber buildout. Verizon has been up and down with Fios over the 15 years that I have covered this company. There are huge investments, huge government-backed investments, disinvestment, and reinvestment. Where are you with Fios now? We love fiber. Some of it is personal. Look, I built my career on fiber. In every role I’ve had at Verizon, we ended up building more fiber. Verizon was the first. In 2004, we created the Fios network. It was the first, probably in the world, to have fiber. We slowed down a bit in the middle; it was mostly a capital allocation issue for us. We always liked the business. We committed to it at an OPEX level, but we had to invest in 4G. We had to buy the spectrum to invest in 4G. Then we had to buy the spectrum for 5G. Some of the capital that we would’ve put into fiber then, we ended up moving to the wireless side of the business. Now that the 5G is towards the back end of its build, we are back in the fiber business. We bought Frontier, and we are going to close before the year’s end, or maybe in the first quarter of 2026. That’ll give us another 10 million homes. Nilay, we’re going to have a path to get to 40 million homes of fiber. And fiber is so resilient. The churn is very low. The customer satisfaction is crazy high. Then, when you put the two together, mobile and home, the economics are fabulous. We are really committed to a converged strategy on fiber plus mobility, and that’s the business we are in. We are not distracted as a company. It’s very simple. People ask me, “What do you do?” I say, “I connect things, I connect people.” Full stop. There’s no other business we want to be in, and fiber is part of that story. Well, I’m on a Fios connection now. So if this drops, it’s on you. Just letting you know. Nilay, it ain’t dropping. I’m on a Fios connection too, and it ain’t dropping. Describe the structure of Verizon broadly. You’ve laid it out in a big way, right? There’s the network, there’s business, and there’s consumer. How many people do you have in consumer, and how is that actually structured inside Verizon? We work with partners, as well as... A lot of our call centers have partners. Some of our stores have partners. We have probably around 30,000-ish people in the consumer unit broadly. I probably end up managing, directly or indirectly, the 30,000 people between our call center partners and our agents to do the work that Verizon consumer is tasked with. The way we are structured internally in Consumer is that we have a gentleman, Frank Boulben, who runs revenue for us. He has all the product offerings. The go-to-market sits with him. Then we have Kevin [Zavaglia], who runs our field. We are the sixth-largest retailer in America. We have 8,000 exclusive stores between our brands. Kevin runs all of that, plus our relationships on the distribution side. Then we have Nancy Clark, who runs our prepaid business. It’s a fully integrated business. We’ve turned around that business really well. We should touch on that at some point. She runs that. Monica Hammond runs all our customer service, customer care, and customer success organization. And Brian Higgins runs customer experience and digital. A very typical structure that we have. I think most telcos end up doing something quite similar to this. Is there any innovation in that structure? We have a lot of startup founders come on the show that have big ideas about structure, and then maybe they land in one of two or three different ones. But then you see some companies show up and say, “Okay, there’s actually efficiency from rethinking the structure.” Telcos are big, regulated companies. Obviously, that shapes how you would run a company like Verizon. But do you see any efficiency there compared to your big competitors like AT&T or T-Mobile? I was a management consultant. I was with a Boston Consulting Group for a very, very long time before this. We had a strong thesis on organization and structure. Then I became a day-to-day operator. I think as long as your structure is not crazy stupid, it works. It all comes down to people and taking friction out of the process. Because any structure will have a seam in it, otherwise the president of the country should be running every single thing on a single day-to-day basis. It doesn’t work. When you break it up into a company, break it up into divisions, you’ll have a seam everywhere. The question is, how do you manage the seam? Because every time you ship a product out, you ship your org structure. We know it. Okay? The question is, where are the seams, and how do you take the friction of those seams out? For example, customer care and digital. One is the digital channel. One is a human being getting called. When you call up, does the lady in customer care know what you did in digital five minutes ago? There’s a seam in the organization. You have to go and manage those seams, not get too bent about who reports to whom and what structure it is. And I think people tend to change structures a lot, hoping they’re going to get magic out of it. But I think the magic is in friction, seam management, and never ever shipping your org structure on your product. Your product should not look like your org. The other big Decoder question I ask everybody is about decisions. You have a lot of decisions to make. Everything from going to try to buy spectrum, to customer-facing decisions. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? I have a framework for decision-making. It’s a two-by-two matrix. Of course, any recovering consultant has to tell you that. On the X axis, it’s what I call a one-way decision or a two-way decision. One-way decisions for me are really big and very difficult to unwind. It’s things like buying other companies. Even some big leadership decisions, long-term pricing decisions, and big product categories that you want to be in. These are one-way decisions. The cost to unwind is very high, very painful, and will take a toll on the company and its finances. That’s one. Then I have what I call two-way decisions. It’s a promotion. It’s moving a few people around in the markets. It’s trying different things with retailers, trying different compensation things. These are two-way decisions. They can be reversed. Damage can be limited. You could make a bad decision, but you can limit the damage. Then on the other axis, I have low dollars and high dollars. Low dollar, I have a certain threshold in my head. These are low-dollar decisions. And then you have high-dollar decisions. You never want to spend time with one-way, low-dollar decisions. They’re just bad. You should never even have one of those, but people spend time in companies on that. I work very hard not to make those decisions at all. Because if something is a one-way decision and big enough, it had better have a high impact. If it’s low impact, you shouldn’t do it because there’s risk in it, and it’s not worth it. Anything that is a two-way decision, that is also low-dollar, you should delegate it. Someone else can make the decision, you’ll be fine. And you have to trust the governance model, that there are checks and balances, so nothing bad happens. I try to spend 60 percent of my time on one-way decisions that are high-dollar value. Where to invest? What categories to do? Who are the big leadership positions I want to fill with talent? And I map every decision down to this framework, and I actively manage it. Just moving from a staff role into a large ops role, the best way to understand how a company runs is to follow the decision-making style. How do decisions get made? Who makes them? Who has the pocket vetoes? You can understand every single thing about a group you’ve inherited by just following decisions. Take five decisions, and track them end-to-end. That’s it. That’s all you need to know. You know about people. You know about pocket vetoes. You know who the naysayers are. You know who’s not ambitious, and you know about talent. For me, decision-making is a science and an art, and one that I practice really aggressively every time I can. That was the best answer to the decision-making question we’ve ever gotten, but that’s the thesis of the show, right? Inside the question about structure and decision-making, I can tell you about 80 percent of your company. I know it from the jump, and then we can go on to the actual specifics. But yours is an interesting answer because you’ve devalued the structure question, and you’ve raised the value of the decision question. Most folks do it the other way around. Why make the flip? Because I think organization is a people construct. When people like each other, when they feel like their work is well taken care of and appreciated, and they’re in a well-supported framework, they’ll give it their best. I think people use structure sometimes to pit people against each other and give conflicting priorities to different people, thinking they’re going to get the best answer. I do not believe in that. I strongly believe... I have extra time sometimes. Rare, but I do have extra time. This afternoon from 4PM to 6PM, I don’t have anything on my calendar. I will go back and say, “Where can I take the friction out of the organization?” Because when my role is... The best use of my time is when I take the friction out. For example, there may be friction between two groups. I go sit down with them, “Tell me, why is there friction? Oh, we have an issue with priorities. Let’s go sort it out.” The minute we take the friction out, people work well together. Organization gets devalued completely. Then it all comes back to decision-making. And second is… Organization is always a moment-in-time issue because priorities change, people change, and organizations change. You can’t use an org structure to drive performance in the field and priorities. I like decision-making as a more powerful tool to do that. And the second is, how much data is enough to make a decision? This is something, I think, a lot more material should be written about. I promise I will not write a book on this when I retire. People think there are some groups that think they need 100 percent of the data to make a decision. Some make it on a gut. I don’t think both are right or wrong, but we also need a good framework for that as well. Like, “When are you ready to pull the trigger on things?” It’s difficult in big companies, but it’s also very difficult in startups, and I think it’s a very different construct. Because in my business, I know the market, I know the customer. I have 100 years’ worth of customer experience and customer elasticity models to work with. It’s a very different thing. When in startup mode, you’re creating a category. TAM doesn’t exist. You’re stretching PowerPoint to make your TAM real. You have to rely more on the gut to make those calls. When it comes to people decisions, you can put them through evaluation, but you have to make decisions based on gut [feelings]. But when we’re making a pricing promotion, or product-fit decisions in my world, I think it’s a little more data-driven. That is another area where I think I’ll become a better manager if I practice more of that. Let’s put some of this into practice. Let’s just walk through an easy one here. Verizon just announced a three-year price lock for customers. This is right on top of the Trump tariffs. I always wonder how these decisions get made. A long, long time ago, I asked another network executive, “Why is this pricing like this?” And the answer — this is a real answer that I received from your other big competitor, but a decade ago — was, “Well, this is how the computer system works. To make it different, we would have to reprogram a bunch of billing systems, and that’s costly. This is how our pricing works.” It was a very honest answer. It was also somewhat disillusioning, in the moment, that the pricing of the network plan was more related to the structure of the computer system that ran the billing than anything customers could perceive. I’m assuming it’s been a decade. I’m assuming everyone has upgraded their billing systems. But you announced this three-year price lock right on top of the tariffs. The marketing is that you want to give customers predictability. Lots of people have lots of feelings about wireless pricing. I have lots of feelings about wireless pricing. But that decision, you’re going to lock rates for three years, that touches your marketing, revenue, and forecasting. How do you make that kind of decision? We are in the middle of a large turnaround in the consumer business. Verizon used to take the most share of the growth. We had the lowest churn in ‘21. In 2021 and ‘22, we lost our way a little bit. My chairman, Hans, spoke about it. We got sloppy. We know it. Since then, we have been back on the turnaround track to do that. It’s a three-step turnaround. Step one for me was to fix sales. Fix our stores, fix our compensation system. Become a local company. We came to national… Everything was decided in this building. It didn’t make sense for a company our size. Step two was to take care of a price premium. We had a 40 percent price premium to the market on our plans. I think that is unsustainable for us. Look, we had a better network, we knew it, but 40 percent was too much for us. So we tweaked it. We are now down to 10 percent, 10 to 15 percent, depending on how we look at it. I think it is sustainable. We are growing our non-connectivity business really well. The third journey for me was to get my churn back in shape. Churn is the number of customers who end up leaving us every single month. It’s still very low. It’s like 0.7 or 0.8. So think about it. Nine percent of our customers leave us every year, which means our average customer stays with us for 11 years, which is crazy, by the way. And in Fios, that number is close to 20 or 30 years, depending on how you look at it. It’s a loyal base, but you want churn to go down every single time because it’s expensive to acquire customers. We spend a lot of money upfront acquiring them. For me, it was how do you get churn in a much better place? We went and asked customers. For the last four quarters, we polled customers. Nilay, I’ll give you a great tool that we built with AI, where… It’s an internal tool we built. Every day, I get half a million calls coming into my customer care centers. Every single day, they come in. And we take every one of those calls, transcribe them, and put them in a generative AI machine. At 9AM, I get a sheet of paper that tells me the sentiments, key themes, and what happened with all of yesterday’s calls. It is mind-blowing because earlier [before this tool], I had to call people. We had analysts who used to listen to calls, transcribe them, and make notes. Now every single call is put in a machine, and I get a piece. We picked up two very clear themes when I did that. The first one for me was certainty. People are like, “Everything in my life is uncertain right now. There’s uncertainty about the economy. There’s uncertainty about my job. There’s uncertainty about work from home. There’s just a lot of tension. I want certainty with prices, especially with categories I cannot live without. And phone is one of those categories.” Certainty kept coming up again and again in our reads from the market. The second thing that came up was flexibility. I never want to pay for something I don’t use. That’s one of the reasons why we took out all those inclusions. You get this free, you get that free. And people are like, “I know Disney is good. My kids love Disney, but I don’t watch Disney. Why should I have to pay for it?” Those were the two really clear insights we got from customers. That’s one. Second, we’ve done a series of price increases over the last couple of years. We had a couple in January. We know elasticity. When we do a price up, we model it. I would say the last price up we did, the elasticity was a little more than what we had modeled. That, coupled with all the insights we got from the customer, we had to respond and tell the customers that we are going to lock prices for three years. Now, it gives customers certainty. It puts a little more pressure back on us because we have to drive revenue in other ways. We have clear ways to do that, but I think it’s an industry first, especially now. Look, we knew the tariffs were coming in the day before yesterday. It was announced... It’s on TV. We are very comfortable doing that because, at a time of uncertainty, we want to give our customers some certainty and some peace of mind. All right, I’m going to be pretty hard on you now. I have covered the telecom industry for a long time. I noticed yesterday [April 3] that every other stock in the world dropped, and telecoms went up. Because people have to have your service, right? It is a requirement of modernity to be connected to the internet and to have a phone. And it feels like one of the reasons fiber customers stick around for a long time is that there’s nowhere else to go, right? The switching costs are very high, or maybe infinite, because there’s literally no other competitor that can offer the service that Fios offers, in many places. That’s true for every residential broadband provider, as competition is generally low. In mobile, the competition is basically you and AT&T, and then T-Mobile is a very strong challenger that’s gotten bigger. But Verizon and AT&T are the biggest players still. There was supposed to be a fourth player, and the government created this Dish Network deal, which I will ask you about soon. That has gone nowhere, right? There’s not actually a fourth national carrier that competes with you. When you say customers stick around for a long time, what I see is, well, there’s nowhere else to go, right? How much does that come to your thinking that, actually, a Fios customer can’t leave? A Fios customer can leave tomorrow morning. Every single Fios customer today can move to cable broadband that afternoon. There are very few Fios customers who don’t have a cable competitor in play. I just think Fios is a better solution. It’s a significantly better solution than cable because of the pricing practices they’ve had and the quality of their network. But there is a full- I hear you, and I’m sorry to interrupt, but I’ve heard that line from many, many, many telco executives in the United States. I look at the United Kingdom, for example, where they’ve done local loop unbundling. And, actually, my colleagues who live in London have 15 fiber providers at much lower prices and much higher speeds because the presence of competition is so much higher, right? It’s not literally switching from fiber to cable, a different kind of network, it’s different providers within the same fiber network offering more competition. We’ve not done that here, but they’re always switching, and you can see the prices come down because of it. I think it’s a careful balance. Canada has moved to a local loop unbundling scenario as well. The UK has always had it. That’s why European telecom has one of the lowest investments in telecom ever, in any country, almost in any region of the world today, because they just don’t have enough of a profit pool and cash flow to reinvest back in their network. Think about 5G. We are going to get to 90 percent deployment in a country as large and diverse as us. Most European countries are not even at 40 to 50 percent deployment of 5G. I think one of the things, if America wants to be competitive, if America wants to compete with China, having high-quality broadband is super important for that. Whether it’s mobility or whether it’s that. And you want to create profit pools in the system to go back and reinvest. Think about it. I’m going to invest close to $18.5 billion in just capital. In the last seven years, we’ve invested $200 billion in the network. $200 billion between spectrum and fiber, and the mobility business. I don’t see any European carrier investing $200 billion in seven years. In fact, if they invest a 10th of that, they’re going to get an award. I think it’s super important for a country to be really at the cutting edge of technology, the cutting edge of fiber, the cutting edge of 5G. And look, when 6G comes, we will be the first. I’ll tell you that today. We were the first in 5G. We beat the Koreans by 12 hours. We will beat whoever else... And most likely it’s going to be China on 6G as well. I think it’s a national security issue. It’s a national competitive issue. We need to keep reinvesting in broadband every single time, and we are not going to stop. You’ll see us investing at the same rate for a very, very long time. And all our investment is in America, in LA. I’m not investing in other countries. I’m 100 percent invested in America, and I think the profit pool lets us do that. All right, we’re here at the end, right? 5G is done, it’s deployed. Everybody has the 5G phones. What were the stakes of losing the race to 5G? No one ever gave me an answer to this question. If China had somehow won the 5G race, what would they have gotten that we didn’t get? What does it mean to lose the race? I think the first thing is standards. You want a standard that... You don’t want a bifurcation of standards, and it may happen. It could happen in the chipset, it could happen in AI, or operating systems and handsets. You’re in an interesting phase where you could potentially see a bifurcation of standards between the Western world and China. On 5G, we aligned on a very similar standard, and I think it helped because you’re able to take the price of the technology down to do that. The second is to think of all the applications and the tech economy that you have today. The app ecosystem, the Amazons of the world, the Googles of the world, and the Metas. They rely on the mobility network more than anyone else. Think about Instagram, it is worth zero without the cell phone and the connectivity. In fact- No, but specifically 5G. Instagram was worth a lot on the LTE network, and most of the 5G networks we have today are not running on millimeter wave 5G or whatever. They’re running on LTE enhanced, right? We’re still running... The core of the network here in the United States is a hybrid of 4G and 5G. No, if we had stuck with just LTE, we would not be able to take care of the capacity that’s happened. Think about it, the pandemic happened, we all moved to working from home, people… We were able to take care of those networks immediately because we had 5G; we could scale up. So 5G adds capacity in a way 4G could never have added because it comes down to spectral efficiency to do that. And we also ended up adding... Look, at the end of the day, capacity is a very simple thing. You can either add more spectrum, which is expensive, but you can add it. We do it every X years, we do that. Or you can add more cell sites because you can reuse the spectrum, or you can get back to spectral efficiency. That’s the only three ways to add capacity. And 5G helps with one in three. It puts new spectrum bands into play, and it also helps with spectral efficiency. You got a lot more capacity out of 5G, and also took the cost of capacity down. Every incremental bit that abides, depending on how you put it up in the air, the cost goes down significantly. We saw a 30 to 40 percent reduction in cost per bit when you move from 4G to 5G. Without 5G, we could not have done that. The second is that we created a whole business around fixed wireless access, providing broadband by using wireless. It’s all on 5G. It ain’t on 4G, I’ll tell you that. It’s a multi-billion-dollar business for us. In a few years... Right now, probably 50 to 60 million homes could potentially get that. It’s another competitor to broadband. And what has happened is that cable has not been able to raise prices, and so it’s a lot more beneficial to customers because they have another competitor in the space to do that. The third thing, which I think has been a little underwhelming for me, personally, is new products and services using some of the 5G capabilities. And you never get this right because you have to get the network, the handset, and the apps all perfectly aligned. I don’t think that happened very well on 5G. I think the third leg of the stool still has more work to do. I think a lot of the AR/VR type new form factors that we are seeing are going to require really low latency, and that will require 5G. You definitely can’t do it on 4G. Sitting where I am, I’m so happy we did 5G. I wish we had done it two years earlier, but that’s always the scenario. And look, we’ll keep building our network, adding more capacity till 6G is up. I sat in all the demos of all the hyped 5G applications. I went on so many self-driving car rides at CES, powered by 5G, with the data center somewhere that was driving the car for me because the latency was low. I heard a lot about robot surgery — an infinite amount about robot surgery. Those were the applications that were promised. That was the vision of the war: that if we lose the war, China will own this set of industries that is built on the new network. It was not about network capacity in COVID, right? No one foresaw that what we would need is a more efficiently run network. It was not really about bringing prices down in any substantial way, because the only thing that ever happens is prices go up. That’s the spread, right? I’m just wondering, do you see the gap in how much hype there was for 5G and how oversold it was? And also the consumer reality of it, which is, yeah, everyone’s phones might have a little more network capacity. Yes, it’s great at the concert or the football game to have millimeter wave serving everyone really fast. I agree that that’s a great use case. But it actually didn’t pan out that the big set of applications we were promised, to justify this enormous cost and all of this literal war hype. It never came to pass. Yeah, I think wireless is one of the categories that has had negative inflation over the last 15 years. Think about it. When you had 300 minutes on your phone, you were allowed... Evenings and nights were free. You remember the time when you got maybe 300 texts. You were paying more for that than you’re paying today when you get a 5G phone with unlimited data, unlimited text, and satellite messaging included. There are very few categories... In fact, the only other category I can think of that has had negative inflation over the last 15 years is TVs. Flat-screen TVs have really crashed in price. TVs and us are probably the two biggest categories that have gone up. Everything else, prices have gone up significantly. All the way from eggs to others, everything has gone up. Our prices have actually come down for what we provide there. I think the industry is probably one of the most unique industries where we tend to give you a lot more for the same amount or a little less than we did 2, 3, 5, or 10 years ago to do that. The second thing is I do... Technology is interesting. For decades, nothing happens, and then in months, decades happen. You saw that with AI, right? You and I have been listening to AI ever since we were in college, and then suddenly, two years or a year and a half ago, the whole thing exploded. I think a lot of these special cases, new applications that we are working on, tend to be like that as well. It takes a while to work it. Look, I don’t think autonomous cars or robotic surgery are going to be the ones that are going to break the bank or are going to be the breakthrough services. But I see new form factors emerging. We may be in the last generation of phone form factor as we know it right now. I think you’re going to see a lot more control of the phones using LLM models. I think it’ll have huge implications for the operating system and huge implications on the app store. But I think this may be the last generation of smartphones that we see. And to power all of the other things, we just need a better network. The second thing is that we are doing a lot more work on 5G in the industrial space. It’s not something you and I end up using a lot, but in my old job, we used to do a lot of private networks, low-latency networks, running robotics, and factory automation based on a wireless network. There’s a lot more happening in that space. When you roll out such transformational technologies, you’ve got to play the long game. Look, Verizon is a company. We are committed to America. Look, we don’t do business in other parts of the world except for small business. We are committed to America, and we want Americans to have the best network, and we’ll keep deploying capital to make that happen. I think most consumers saw 5G as something that just sort of happened to them, right? They upgraded the phone, the network is there, and then I hear you on negative inflation and value over time, but the main thing that happened is you upgraded your iPhone. Now it’s 5G capable. You need a 5G plan, and that costs more than the plan you had yesterday. That is not true. But that was true for a vast majority of people across the vast majority of the industry. The plans did get more expensive. Actually, it didn’t. If you see phone ARPU, average revenue per user, which every carrier reports in some form or the other. ARPU has moved very little on a per-phone-line basis in the last 20 years that I’ve been in the space. And you’re getting a lot more now than you got many years ago. I think people have this notion that the phone bill is going up, but the phone bill is going up because they’re signing up for new services. For example, in my case, we are going to have a $2 billion business selling streaming services and entertainment services. Now, we give great savings. We give you a 40 percent discount when you buy Disney or Netflix, Max, and all the cool services from us. But the core phone service, as you know it, has really not gone up in price. And we’ve delivered more than pretty much any other industry for the price point that we do. And I’m very, very comfortable with that equation. It’s my job as the CEO of the business to ensure that we give more to our customers. Satellite messaging is one. It’s something… We found a way, we made it work, and we included it in our plans. You pay zero for it. I think we are adding significant value to customers, which is why our churn is so low. People can move wireless easily, but because of the value we bring to them every single day, they like us and they stay with us. One of the things that’s interesting there is the comparison to televisions, which you made. The reason televisions got so cheap is that the industry realized that putting a computer in the TV let them develop huge new revenue models, right? A $500 TCL TV is actually a revenue generator because there’s advertising baked into every layer of that TV now, or effectively a free Roku box. Roku owns the entire ad stack. That’s how they make all their revenue. It’s easy for them to subsidize the TVs in that way. That’s not really the case with mobile handsets, right? It might be the case on maybe the low end of Android phones. There’s some subsidy happening there. With the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple’s not going to let you monetize that device as directly as anybody wants to. The push has always been to go up the stack, right? To go into the application layer. A decade ago, we had a fight about net neutrality where the carriers really wanted to be in the application layer and modify the network to prefer some applications over others. That has petered out. I think it burbles up every now and again, but it’s mostly petered out. Now you’re saying the opportunity is to bundle Disney+, right? To bundle other applications. Is that settled now that that is the strategy? Or is the push into developing custom applications for your network, or the push to prefer bandwidth for some applications? Is that incentive still there? I think what does Verizon bring to the table? We bring distribution. We bring billing and customer care. We know how to manage subscriptions. We bring a brand that has got unaided awareness of close to 100 percent. Those are the big things we bring. And I think what we’ve decided is that we want to build our non-connectivity. My non-connectivity business is almost $15 billion. It’s the size of Hilton Hotels. My non-connectivity business is a standalone company. And we partner with the best in the world to do that. I partner with Netflix. I partner with Disney. We have an insurance protection product inside that. We partner with other folks to do that piece. I think we want to use our distribution, our ability to scale subscriptions, our ability to lower the cost of acquisition, and partner with the best. But second, the more people use my network, the more excited I get. We are working very, very closely with the likes of Amazon, Meta, Google, and Apple to ensure that they use our network more to develop more services because we will monetize it at the network layer really well. Then, on top of the network, we’ll find adjacencies to sell in. But if people don’t use my network more, all the cool services I build ain’t going to matter much. I think we’ve pivoted to a strategy, which is single network, scaled network, put as much traffic on it as people can, and we’ll find ways to monetize it in a pricing construct if we do that. On top of that, we have adjacencies. We have six categories we sell into, and there we use our scale distribution, and some integration back with our network to make it real to do that. I think, in a way, we are probably the largest incubator in the world today because we work closely with companies for them to go and innovate services. It’s a pretty cool position to be in. And as we finish deploying 5G, we’ll start seeing more and more of those cool services come out. One of the things that I think about is that there was just an explosion of big carriers buying media, right? Because you have the distribution, you have the billing. It made sense to vertically integrate all the way up to the top. At one point, Verizon owned Yahoo, which was very confusing. You started what was like a prototype of TikTok called Go90, which failed almost immediately. It’s a long-running joke in our other show, The Vergecast. You owned HuffPost. You had Tumblr for a second. On the business side, you bought BlueJeans, which is a video conferencing solution. That notion that you need to actually own the icon that the user is pushing on or the media they’re consuming on the phone. AT&T bought Time Warner, another obvious disaster that collapsed almost immediately. Where did those incentives come from to do that? And do you think that they’ve gone away? Has everyone learned their lesson? Yeah, and look, it happens in every industry. Look, at the end of the day, you can either grow horizontally or you can go vertically. There are only two ways to grow. We went through a phase... Look, I was on the leadership team of Yahoo and AOL. I was sent from Verizon to help run those assets and eventually sell them. And part of the thesis was that we create data in the telco world, whether it’s clickstream data, location data, or other network data, that, if matched with online data, could create a better targeting engine for advertisers. That was a thesis going in all the way. But then we realized that customers trust us because we don’t share data. And it was a deep, insightful conversation we had within ourselves, and we realized that we should not be in a business sphere, so we sold that business. But, again, for a company our size, if you look at our enterprise value, it was still a rounding error for us. Fine, it was something we should not have done, but it was still a rounding error for us. At the end of the day, we are focused on our core. Our core tends to be mobility. Our core is fiber, and our core is cloud/AI, enabling those things. That’s it. Those are the only three businesses we are in right now. Carriers around the world have sort of come to a similar place, but we are probably, I would say, the most focused of carriers anywhere in the world right now. Verizon fights the hardest against any net neutrality rules that appear at the state level and at the federal level. We can set a watch on the Verizon lawsuit against those rules. It happens every time. You’re saying you don’t need those rules, right? If I’m listening to you correctly, you’re saying, “We’ve learned our lesson. We’re not going to monkey with the network. We’re not going to prioritize our own services or someone else’s services. We just want volume,” right? Pure volume is what will drive your growth. Why fight against the rules if you’ve already come to the same conclusion? I don’t know what net neutrality does. I’ve been in this business for a little north of 20 years. Before that, I was in college, having fun. And I still don’t know what problem we are trying to solve with net neutrality. I actually don’t understand that, because at the end of the day, if there are 300 people using a congested road, and if a firefighter needs to go through, people are going to move aside and let him go through. That’s all we are saying. For traffic management purposes, we need to have some controls in the network. Otherwise, when in New York City, when the traffic core or the emergency services want access and it’s congested, I’m going to have to move people off so they get priority service. That’s all it is. And we need traffic management tools. Or you have one person in your town who’s sucking up all the bandwidth, and we have places like that where they use 100 or 200 times the average bandwidth. And because of that, 99 percent of the people are getting a shitty experience. We’ve got to manage the traffic. That’s all we are saying about it. I think this was a little bit of drama about nothing. And at the end of the day, we want to build networks and we want people to use them. We just want the ability to manage network management in a way that’s good for the broad set of people. I don’t think we really care about making one group better versus one group worse, which is why I think it got no traction, because I don’t know what problem it was trying to solve. To be clear, it did get traction. It passed through the FCC under Title II in one administration. It was undone by another administration. I have never encountered a net neutrality rule at the federal or state level that hasn’t allowed for reasonable network management practices, right? That’s always the heart of the rule. It’s really: can you prefer some content and services over others, right? No blocking, no throttling. It’s the heart of the rules, and Verizon has fought against those. I have seen your competitors do things like sponsor data, right? I’ll let you off the hook for one second. AT&T, when they owned Max, exempted Max from their own data caps, which was just openly unfair, right? It’s just straightforwardly unfair that using Netflix would cost a customer money, and using AT&T’s owned and operated service would not. And that was an advantage that AT&T wanted to give to Max at that time. And that is the sort of thing that isn’t a firefighter on the road, that isn’t one person using all the bandwidth. That is a distortion in the market. That’s what the rule is supposed to correct. What good did it do for AT&T or for any customer in that scenario? Look, I don’t know what AT&T did, but I think at the end of the day... I don’t think a lot of these folks understand how networks work. Because at the core of these networks is a very complex set of technologies. You have the access network, you have the core, you have peering points, and you have the backbone of the network. Congestion can happen anywhere in the network. For example, if someone doesn’t come and peer with me, they’re going to get congested, but it has nothing to do with me. They’re congested because they chose not to peer with me, and they chose not to peer with me because they didn’t want to pay the $3 or three cents it needed to go and get a port in a particular porting hotel that was needed. I think the network is a very complex thing. It’s not a single pipe that starts at one end and ends at the other. There are a lot of different interfaces and other things. I think this whole concept that you’re going to unfairly manage someone’s network or give someone an unfair advantage, I don’t think it works that way. The second is an economic incentive piece. Look, in the case of AT&T, again, I’m being an academic here, which is that they bought Max, or whatever it was called back then, and they were willing to give up their dollars because network costs something. They’re able to give that up to drive sales of content. That’s a decision they made. In the end, it didn’t work out that well because it didn’t matter. I think there are economic incentives in place to manage all of this. That’s why I think net neutrality has gone literally nowhere because it doesn’t solve any problem that I think is a problem. Again, I want to be clear that it’s the law in New York. It’s the law in California. It was the law at the federal level, and it was rolled back. So, it did go somewhere at one point. And the most instructive thing I ever heard about net neutrality was that it was just the arc that Netflix went on. Netflix was once the loudest proponent of these rules. And then several years later, I saw Reed Hastings at the Code conference, he said, I believe it was to Peter Kafka, “Oh, we don’t need to have this fight anymore because we’re so big it doesn’t matter.” All that indicated to me was they needed the rule and they needed the fight when they were small, to preserve the access. And then they got so big that they didn’t need the rule to give them access because they were so big that taking access away wouldn’t be a problem. That’s the competitive playing field that I think you want at the application layer as well. It’s really hard for people to perceive. I think they didn’t realize it was a problem because it was not a problem. I think it had nothing to do with size. Well, that’s what Reed Hastings said. He said, “I am so big it doesn’t matter.” I know, but I think he probably said that to cover up something where he made a big to-do about nothing. In the end, it didn’t change anything. If customers want Netflix, they’ll get Netflix. We make shitty content, no one’s going to watch it. I think it’s the core of that issue. He very soon realized... I remember that conference. He realized this was a fight about nothing. At the end of the day, if you make good content, customers want it, they’ll appear, and you’ll get access to it. If you make poor content that nobody wants to watch, nobody’s going to watch it. Irrespective of all the so-called net neutrality rules you have. I think that was the perfect example of how it had nothing to do with size. It just had to do with the fact that they were chasing something that made no sense at that point, and he was the first to admit it, so he could focus his efforts on putting on new shows. By the way, I like their new show, The Residence. It’s a good show. You live in a different regulatory environment now. You have Brendan Carr, who’s the chair of the FCC. I’m not a fan of Brendan Carr. I think he’s wielding his power irresponsibly, and he knows that I think that. You mentioned earlier your deal with Frontier, that’s going to go through, and Brendan has been very clear that he will not allow these deals to go through unless you get rid of all your diversity initiatives. And he says there’s an investigation against Verizon on these initiatives. That feels like straight coercion. If Verizon wants to go body up and file lawsuits against the FCC imposing regulatory requirements, this would be where you do it. Are you going to fight that fight, or are you going to roll over? For Verizon, there are a couple of things. Internally, as a company, certain things are non-negotiable for us. How we treat human beings, human dignity, and ensure that we have the best talent pool when we build and operate the largest consumer telco company in the world. We ain’t walking away from that. I think that’s there. At the end of the day, we have to follow the rules and regulations of the land, and we will work constructively. We have a constructive dialogue with the FCC to ensure that we follow the rules and regulations of the land. That’s exactly the piece we are in right now with them. We got the letter from them. We are working closely with the staffers out there. Whatever the regulations or rules of the land are, we’ll follow them. Do you think that you’ll fight that as vociferously as you fought net neutrality? It goes down to the rule of law. Whatever the rule is. Do you think the FCC commissioner has the authority to tell you how to hire and fire inside your company? It goes back to the rules and regulations that the administration puts in place. They have certain rules, they work through it, and we have to follow the rules of the way it lays itself out. That’s all we are going to work towards: a constructive dialogue with Chairman Carr on that piece, and we’ll continue to deliver that. But at the end of the day, I want the best talent pool for my company. I will do anything that is needed to get the best operators, the best marketers, and the best network operators in the world for Verizon to do that piece. I’m walking away from that. I’m going to follow that. In the process, I have to follow rules and regulations — we’ll do that. And if there are some changes that have to be made, we will make those changes. But let’s not forget, this is about getting the best talent from us, and we are not walking away one minute from that mission. Literally, just a few days before we’re talking, I think T-Mobile closed the deal to do a JV on some fiber initiative. But to get there, they had to delete the word diversity from a bunch of its web pages. Is that the level of meddling that you’re willing to accept? We are still working with the FCC on what the rules are. How we develop the rules. How we execute the rules on that. It’s a work in progress right now. We are still working through that. But look, at the end of the day, we’re going to have to follow the rules of the land. We did that before, we’ve done that. We’re going to do that after that. This is just one of those pieces, we’re going to have to follow the rules that are there. I want to be very clear, I’m being very explicit about this. When the government passed net neutrality rules, it wasn’t, “We have to follow the rules of the land.” It was, “We are going to file lawsuits for a decade to get out of these rules because we think they’re dumb.” And in this case, you’re saying Brendan Carr, who has been openly censorious, openly chilling of speech, openly hostile to companies because they have diversity initiatives — you’re saying you just have to follow his rules? We have to follow the rules of the land. I don’t think those are his rules. They are the rules of the land and administration — Are you going to file a decade’s worth of lawsuits about these rules? We don’t know. We’re going to work constructively with them to follow the rules that are needed. But at the end of the day... Look, our role is to the stakeholders that we have. My stakeholders are my shareholders, my customers, my employees, and society at large. We have to manage, and we are going to deliver to those stakeholders what’s needed for us, and we will do whatever is needed with the administration to deliver to all the stakeholders. When you run a large company our size, you have to balance the different stakeholders, and we will balance those stakeholders. We’ve done it extremely well in the last 25 years that we’ve been Verizon, and we’ll continue to do that going forward. Can you put this in your decision matrix? When you look at an administration that shows up and says, “We’re going to start meddling with your deals.” From an agency that traditionally has not done this specific kind of meddling in how you hire and fire, how do you think about that decision in your two-by-two matrix? This is not the first deal we’ve taken through administrations. We worked with Democrats, we worked with Republicans, we worked with both sets of the administration. We’ve had good success working with both of them on that piece. Every time we take a deal through, there are trade-offs that have to be made. When we bought TracFone, we had trade-offs we had to make with California that were probably not perfect for us as well. I do think there are trade-offs that need to be made in any large transaction. But at the end of the day, you have to follow the rules of the land. I think that’s the most important thing, and we’ve got to manage the stakeholders. And that’s pretty much all we are going to do here. All right. I want to wrap up by asking you about a very silly thing from the first Trump administration. In the first Trump administration, T-Mobile bought Sprint. And at the time, that set of players in Trump one concocted a deal where Sprint would sell some assets to Dish Network, and we would invest in a thing called Open RAN to get away from Huawei and have more competition at the tower level. These are all good ideas in theory. Have you spent one minute thinking about the competition posed by Dish Network? Look, we have three large wireless carriers in a very, very competitive market. We have Dish with its Boost network, which is competitive in the prepaid space. They’re a pretty large player in the prepaid space. They’re starting to build postpaid. Then you have the cable companies today, Comcast, Charter, and Cox, all offer wireless services at very competitive prices. In fact, in many cases, the first line is free, and their average ARPU is significantly lower than ours. It is one of the most competitive telco markets in the world today. Three full players, a fourth facility player who is building up, and then a cable company that has 100 percent coverage of the country, which is able to offer wireless. It’s a pretty competitive market that we have in this space right now. No, but I’m asking you specifically about Dish, right? That was five years ago. I think June or July of 2020. That deal was completed. They had access to T-Mobile’s network for seven years. We’re coming to the end of that. They are supposed to have a next-generation 5G Open RAN that is a national competitor to you by now. Do you think they have a national, competitive Open RAN that causes you to lose any sleep? They’re a competitor to us. They have, I think, a little less than... The Boost network creates millions and tens of millions of customers — But that’s just what they bought from Sprint. That was the existing asset they bought from Sprint. That’s not the thing they were meant to build. They’ve built local networks. And do we compete with them? We compete with them in the space. But think about it, we have three full networks that are building up, and then we have competition. This is one of the most competitive markets. Look, Open RAN is a completely different animal. We should definitely talk about that. Look, over a period of time, Open RAN is a good thing, because it deconstructs the network a little bit. You can have multiple players in a stack. And for folks who are not close to this, today, when we buy equipment from a partner, we end up buying almost the whole stack. The head end that goes on to the tower, all the equipment at the bottom of the tower, is from a single provider. And Open RAN says, “Make those interfaces more standardized so that you can mix and match operators more easily.” I think philosophically, Open RAN is a good concept. I think more work is needed to get to the performance that makes us comfortable using it at scale. But what we’ve done is we’ve virtualized our networks more than any other carrier in the world. What does that mean? We’ve put generic hardware in our sites, and then the equipment providers have to load their software on it. We think that’s actually a more powerful tool in mix and match, scaling, and loading cost than sometimes de-standardizing or standardizing these interfaces. But over a period of time, it’s important to have more diversity of vendors and have more people play in this space. It’s good for us, it’s good for the economy. I think we are very supportive of O-RAN. We are part of the Alliance. We spend a lot of time, energy, and money on R&D and making those interfaces stable. But I feel it has a little more to go before they’re standardized, and they give you the performance that I get to put on my network. Well, Sampath, you’ve given us a lot of time. I feel like you should come back and we should talk about Open RAN for a full hour, because I can. I think it is fascinating. We’ll have to have you back soon. Thank you so much for being on Decoder.

Title: What’s So Special About Nancy Pelosi’s Stock Trading Activities?

Time Published: 2025-04-21T14:46:30Z

One of the most interesting investors over the past few years isn’t some hedge fund manager or Wall St veteran, it’s congressional representative Nancy Pelosi. Her investing disclosures include early bets on Nvidia and Tempus AI before both companies had a massive run-up in valuation, along with many other profitable trades. While insider trading is illegal for everyone, including members of congress, many people believe that she could be using confidential information from her insights into laws before they’re made public. That doesn’t mean that people can’t also benefit from her trades, however. How are people taking advantage? While the obvious best-case-scenario would be for this kind of political trading to be banned, one company decided that regular people should be able to get similar exposure to her trades. That’s where Dub, and their affiliate Dub Advisors comes in. They’ve built an app that has access to a model portfolio that tracks her trading strategies and automatically rebalances whenever her moves are publicly announced. Since their $PELOSI portfolio launched on September 27, 2023, it’s returned 77.34% as of April 1, 2025. Why follow politician trades? Politicians may have access to information or insights that are not readily available to the public. For example, they may have insights into how upcoming legislation or regulations will impact specific industries and companies. In some cases, they might even anticipate global events through sensitive briefings or influence a company’s prospects through their legislative power. Dub Advisors’ $PELOSI portfolio aims to capitalize on these potential information advantages by purchasing stocks that Pelosi has bought. How is the $PELOSI portfolio constructed? Dub Advisors built the $PELOSI portfolio using public financial disclosures required by the STOCK Act. These disclosures provide information about securities transactions made by members of Congress and other senior government officials. While the portfolio is constructed from these disclosures, it isn’t an exact replica of Pelosi’s investments. Due to reporting and technical limitations, that’s not feasible. Instead, they apply proprietary techniques used by hedge funds to design a portfolio with the most potential to outperform the market. Their strategy for creating politician portfolios focuses on two key factors: While their exact methods are proprietary, some concrete ways that Dub Advisors find stocks with high conviction and information asymmetry are: While past performance does not guarantee future results, PELOSI’s excellent performance thus far has boosted their confidence in this methodology. Doesn’t the 45-day reporting delay hurt returns? Politicians have 45 days to report their stock transactions, meaning that we find out about their trades well after they happen. While it would be ideal to know about trades instantly, the 45-day reporting lag does not render their strategy ineffective. Most politicians buy and hold for long periods of time. For example, Dub Advisors’ $PELOSI portfolio has continuously held a position in NVDA since inception in September 2023, so a 45 day delay doesn’t affect overall performance much. Moreover, politicians often report trades well before the 45-day limit since there is no benefit to delaying. For example, Pelosi’s most recent buy of NVDA occurred on July 25, 2024, and was reported on July 31, 2024. How to invest in the $PELOSI portfolio Want to invest?

Title: Nvidia stock slips as U.S. curbs backfire, boosting China’s chip ambitions

Time Published: 2025-04-21T13:48:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) stock fell more than 6% Monday as investors digested growing fallout from the Biden and Trump administrations’ efforts to curb the company’s chip sales to China. The latest restrictions — announced last week by the White House — tighten the noose on Nvidia’s ability to sell its advanced AI chips abroad. Now Chinese competitors appear ready to fill the gap. A sharp blow came Monday from reports that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its own advanced AI chip — the 910C — as early as next month. The move underscores China’s accelerating effort to sidestep U.S. technology restrictions, and positions Huawei, one of China’s largest tech companies, as a potential beneficiary of the crackdown on Nvidia. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF+2.36%) told CNBC (CMCSA+1.99%) the new export rules may ultimately “do more to help Chinese chip companies than hurt them,” by forcing domestic buyers to pivot away from U.S. suppliers. Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang traveled to China last week for damage control, attempting to reassure partners and regulators that the company still wants to do business there. The White House’s tighter restrictions — part of a tech containment strategy and one more front in the administration’s trade war — specifically target Nvidia’s H20 chip, a product originally designed to comply with earlier export rules. The decision marks a strategic shift: a U.S. willingness to inflict damage on its own most valuable semiconductor company to prevent China from gaining access to leading-edge AI tools. Beijing, for its part, has slammed the U.S. approach and President Donald Trump’s attempts to pressure other countries to cut their own trade with China. On Monday, China’s foreign ministry said it firmly opposes any trade agreements between the U.S. and third-party countries “at the expense of China,” framing the moves as aggressive rather than defensive. Shares of Nvidia are down about 19% in the last month. The Nasdaq has fallen 12% over the same period, while the S&P 500 is down almost 10%. Nvidia’s global significance helps explain the U.S. market’s swift reaction. With a market cap approaching $2.5 trillion, it’s not only the world’s most valuable chipmaker, but the foundational force in AI infrastructure — powering data centers, large language models, and emerging technologies across sectors. Analysts estimate Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI training chip market, making it a linchpin in the global tech arms race. Its dominance also means Nvidia’s stock movements can sway the entire U.S. market. The company now makes up more than 6% of the Nasdaq 100 and about 5.5% of the S&P 500. As a result, Washington’s deepening trade war with China isn’t just geopolitical theater — it’s triggering real volatility and wiping out investor value across indexes, with Nvidia squarely in the middle of the storm.

Title: Cybersecurity’s Red Alert Moment: Hyperscalers Are Consolidating Power
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2025/04/21/cybersecuritys-red-alert-moment-hyperscalers-are-consolidating-power/

ByEmil Sayegh ByEmil Sayegh, Contributor. Hyperscalers are absorbing cybersecurity into their platforms — just as they did with storage, ... More compute and databases. Cybersecurity is no longer a standalone industry — it is becoming a native function of cloud infrastructure as evidenced by Google’s recent purchase of Wiz for a staggering $32B. As hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud embed AI-powered security features into their platforms, the $30 billion Managed Detection and Response market faces an existential threat. This isn’t just vendor jostling — it has deep implications for enterprise IT budgets, private equity-backed investments and even national security. For years, hyperscalers operated as neutral enablers — providing compute and storage while security vendors built the intelligence layer. But history tells us what happens next. First it was storage, then compute, then databases. Now it is security. The same pattern is unfolding again — and this time, they are not just partners. They are poised to be predators. History is the roadmap — and it shows exactly how they plan to attack and absorb this vulnerable, fragmented security services market. What was once outsourced — threat detection, endpoint protection, identity access management and data loss prevention — is now being baked directly into the core of their platforms. Embedded, automated and bundled — not sold as a product, but delivered as a feature. The original relationship was symbiotic. Security vendors brought innovation, the clouds brought scale. But now that balance has collapsed. The hyperscalers are no longer just competing — they are outpacing. They are building security into every layer of their platforms — from AI-powered identity controls to default encryption and automated threat intelligence. And because they control the infrastructure, they control the data. They have access to platform-native telemetry, logs and behaviors that no third party can match. The use of artificial intelligence gives them yet another advantage — one measured not in features but in speed, integration and insight. While independent providers race to keep up, the clouds are already embedding adaptive security into the very foundation of modern IT. MDR vendors like eSentire, Arctic Wolf, Expel, ReliaQuest and Rapid7 have grown fast by investing in automation and extended detection capabilities. But they are running uphill. These firms must build, market and sell their platforms to survive — all while hyperscalers quietly integrate competing capabilities into enterprise agreements. Look at Rapid7 — one of the only publicly traded players in this space. In 2024, it reported $844 million in revenue, up 9 percent year over year, with a 19 percent operating margin. But its stock fell 41 percent. Activist investor Jana Partners, holding a 5.8 percent stake, forced board changes and is now demanding a sale or strategic overhaul. Why? Because markets can smell what’s coming — margin compression and disruption from the inside out. Consider Microsoft Defender, Amazon GuardDuty, Google Chronicle and Microsoft Sentinel. These tools are not sold — they are embedded. They are often activated by default and subsidized through broader infrastructure contracts. They do not need to generate standalone profit — they exist to increase stickiness, lower churn and lock in the customer. In 2024 alone, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta spent over $250 billion in capital expenditures — much of it directed at embedding AI and security across their platforms. That figure is larger than the entire combined valuation of independent cybersecurity vendors. This is not competition. It is gravitational collapse, and it is exactly what happened in the last decade to smaller infrastructure providers. Artificial intelligence is the core disruptor. Hyperscalers are not merely building smarter tools — they are reinventing the security stack from the inside. AI is being trained on massive datasets, with full access to platform behaviors, identity systems and telemetry that no outsider can replicate. The result is security that is real-time, adaptive and invisible — not bolted on, but built in. That is not incremental innovation. That is systemic displacement. Regulators are waking up, but the question is whether it too late before the damage is done. In April 2025, Google lost its second antitrust case in less than a year. Meta is under scrutiny for monopolistic bundling. The hypercalers strategy is familiar — extend the platform, entrench the offering, exclude the competition. Cybersecurity is next. When hyperscalers start bundling endpoint detection and response, policy enforcement and threat management into their infrastructure deals — while underpricing or disabling competitive solutions — regulators will ask whether these behaviors mirror the extend-and-entrench tactics already flagged in other sectors. The questions now on the table in Washington and Brussels: This is not just a shift in architecture — it is a realignment of power. As cybersecurity collapses inward into the cloud platform itself, the ripple effects are being felt across the entire ecosystem. Every stakeholder — from service providers to financial sponsors to national defense agencies — must now reassess assumptions, business models and risk profiles. Managed Service Providers and Managed Security Service Providers built their business models on integrating best-of-breed, third-party cybersecurity tools — layering value through orchestration, visibility and incident response. But that stack is being flattened. Hyperscalers are disintermediating this layer by offering native tools that are cheaper, easier to deploy and pre-integrated with the infrastructure itself. Margins are under pressure. Many MSSPs rely on licensing arbitrage and volume-based resale models that are collapsing as cloud-native security offerings become bundled and commoditized. According to Canalys, spending on MSSPs is growing at just 8 percent annually — a slowdown from prior years — even as demand for cybersecurity services remains strong. That delta reflects erosion in value capture. Differentiation is also eroding. When every enterprise workload sits on a platform that already includes threat detection, identity and log correlation, MSSPs must go deeper — into vertical-specific advisory, regulatory mapping, zero-trust strategy and response playbooks. Those that cannot evolve beyond tool management will become expendable. The next-generation MSSP must pivot away from being a product stack integrator and toward being a trusted advisor. That means investing in proprietary frameworks, industry depth and human-led services that the hyperscalers — by design — cannot replicate. The private equity community has invested tens of billions into roll-ups, platform plays and specialty MSSPs under a common thesis: scale drives efficiency, and efficiency drives margins. But when hyperscalers remove the very foundation of third-party tool layers, that thesis begins to unravel. Multiples are already under pressure. Valuations that assumed sustainable 20 to 30 percent EBITDA on recurring security services may no longer hold. As bundled features reduce the need for outsourced detection or SIEM management, customer stickiness weakens — and churn risk increases. In several recent transactions, we’ve seen diligence processes stall or valuations renegotiated after cloud-native roadmap reviews showed major overlap with portfolio offerings. Even public market signals are clear — Rapid7’s steep stock price decline, despite revenue growth, reflects investor skepticism on long-term margin durability in this segment. Sponsors must now re-underwrite portfolios and exit timelines. The path forward lies in pushing platform companies into verticals or service layers that maintain pricing power — compliance-as-a-service, specialized forensics, incident response retainers — rather than assuming the old playbook of bundling tools will survive. There is no margin for error when it comes to national defense. Yet the same hyperscaler platforms that now power enterprise productivity are also hosting some of the most sensitive workloads in the world — from defense contractors and intelligence agencies to critical infrastructure providers. As cybersecurity becomes a native feature of these platforms, we are not just consolidating capabilities — we are consolidating control and amplifying systemic risk. This introduces a dangerous paradox: the cloud has become both the fortress and the attack surface. A single breach. A single rogue insider. A single software update gone wrong. That’s all it takes. The consequences could cascade across military logistics, energy grids, transportation systems and real-time battlefield surveillance. This is not a hypothetical scenario. The 2020 SolarWinds breach exposed how deeply embedded vulnerabilities can compromise trusted environments. In 2024, we saw how a single botched CrowdStrike update grounded flights, froze retailers and disabled hospital systems. The next time, it could be a compromised core service — not just a patch — and the damage could be exponential. Even more concerning is the opacity of the platforms themselves. When detection, prevention and response functions are all owned, operated and monitored by the same cloud provider, transparency disappears. Federal agencies are left with limited visibility and reduced oversight — unable to independently validate the integrity of the systems they now depend on. At the very moment when national cybersecurity defense should be distributed and resilient, we are centralizing it into a small number of hyperscaler environments. That may be efficient — but it is not safe. And it is certainly not sustainable. The same fate that befell private cloud hosting companies — disintermediated by the public cloud — now threatens MDR and MSSP vendors. This is not theoretical. This is déjà vu. And it is already underway. The industry has five years — maybe less — to adapt. That means redefining value, moving up the stack and delivering what the hyperscalers cannot: trust, objectivity, service and independence. If not, the industry will consolidate further — and this time, the collapse will be silent. This is not just a technology trend. It is a restructuring of the cybersecurity marketplace. And it is happening in real time. The only question is — will vendors, investors and regulators respond before it is too late?

U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Monday as Wall Street braces for a high-stakes week of earnings and mounting geopolitical uncertainty. The S&P 500 was down 1.3%, the Nasdaq fell 1.5%, and the Dow was off more than 400 points. The VIX surged nearly 10%, while gold spiked 2.65% to $3,416.70 — its highest level ever. Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) shares were down about 4% premarket following reports that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of a new AI chip to Chinese customers as early as next month. The move signals China’s accelerating push to replace U.S. technology in sensitive sectors and adds pressure on Nvidia, already under fire from new White House restrictions on chip sales. Analysts warn that Nvidia’s role as a strategic asset in the U.S.-China trade standoff could make it especially vulnerable — with powerful knock-on effects for overall U.S. markets, given Nvidia’s position as one of the largest American companies by market cap. Netflix (NFLX+2.09%) is one of the rare bright spots in early trading, rising roughly 2% after delivering a blockbuster Q1. The company posted nearly $3 billion in profit and a 31.7% operating margin on $10.54 billion in revenue. Its $7.99 ad-supported tier is seen as more resilient in a tightening economy. UnitedHealth Group (UNH-1.96%) remains in focus after last week’s rout, when the stock lost more than 20% on a forecast cut and earnings miss. Shares were slightly lower again Monday morning. This week also brings earnings from Tesla (TSLA+1.13%), Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), IBM (IBM+1.52%), Boeing (BA+2.21%), and Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%), setting the tone for Q2 amid rising fears of a “self-inflicted” recession. In a Sunday memo, analysts at Wedbush said: “The markets and tech world needs to find a path forward quickly and know what the rules of the game are looking ahead. The White House needs trade deals done quick with a negotiation path established with China.” The alternative was grim: “Otherwise the markets, 10-year yield, USD, gold, and the economy will head down their own divergent paths over the coming weeks and months ahead. We view this as a key week ahead to get some trade deals on the board as the Street does not care anymore about words and ‘deal progress’ comments.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

April 21, 2025 08:42 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: The Dow drops 400 points and the Nasdaq reels as earnings season meets tariff chaos

U.S. stocks dropped sharply Monday, continuing a volatile stretch for Wall Street as geopolitical tensions, earnings anxiety, and Federal Reserve uncertainty continue to collide. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the losses, down 2.6% at the closing bell, with the S&P 500 off 2.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 972 points, or 2.5%. The VIX jumped more than 12% as gold surged to a record $3,432 per ounce. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell to a three-year low, and stocks fell further after President Donald Trump again fiercely criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, escalating his pressure campaign on the central bank to cut interest rates. “‘Preemptive Cuts’ in Interest Rates are being called for by many,” Trump said on his social media site Truth Social. “With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden’s egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other ‘things’ trending down, there is virtually No Inflation. With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” Trump’s latest salvo against Powell came days after he said the central bank chief’s “termination cannot come fast enough.” The attacks have deepened investor fears over the Fed’s independence and added to the broader sense of policy unpredictability driving market volatility. It’s no mystery: Long-term investors and operators alike know that trust and stability are core to functioning markets. When leadership injects chaos or undermines institutional credibility, the costs show up everywhere — from higher borrowing rates to delayed investment decisions. Nvidia stock dropped 4.5% after new White House export restrictions on its AI chips appeared to hand a competitive edge to Chinese rivals such as Huawei, which reportedly plans to ship its own advanced chip to local customers as soon as next month. Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) stock fell 6% ahead of Tuesday’s earnings as investors brace for lackluster results and look for any sign of stabilization in demand or margins. With more than 100 companies reporting earnings this week — including Tesla, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), IBM (IBM+1.52%), Boeing (BA+2.21%), and Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%) — traders are looking for any signs of resilience, or at least clarity, as a chaotic second quarter kicks into gear. Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) stock was down after reports that Huawei will begin mass shipments of a new AI chip to Chinese customers as soon as next month. The move highlights Beijing’s push to reduce reliance on U.S. technology — and deepens investor anxiety around Nvidia’s access to the massive Chinese market after the White House imposed additional rules on the company’s chip sales. It’s been a whiplash month for equities, with intraday swings as large as 5% and every major index well off its pre-“Liberation Day” levels. The coming week may determine whether that trend deepens... or finally breaks. Earnings from tech giants, including Tesla and Google, will be scrutinized not just for growth but for signs of stability in a market that’s grown more erratic by the day. With so many companies reporting this week, the next few days could set the tone for the rest of the second quarter. “The Street does not care anymore about words and ‘deal progress’ comments,” Wedbush analysts said in a Sunday note. “The economic damage done from this Trump back and forth tariff plan has likely pushed the economy towards a recession path already as cap ex [has been] halted across the board, hiring plans paused, price increase worries, and supply chain shock/chaos has sparked a level of uncertainty in the US not seen since Covid days.” The difference, Wedbush noted, is that this time the damage is “self-inflicted,” concluding bluntly: “We are heading into a tech earnings season that we expect minimal/no guidance as C-level executives are playing darts blindfolded with gauging the growth and spending plans of their customers.” One bright spot? Netflix (NFLX+2.09%). In the first quarter of 2025, the company posted an almost-$3-billion profit on $10.54 billion in revenue — with an eye-popping 31.7% operating margin. Wall Street seems especially approving of Netflix’s ad-supported $7.99 monthly membership, which appears less vulnerable to recession-driven household savings measures. Netflix stock rose 1.6% on Monday. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Should You Buy The Current Dip In Novo Nordisk Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BAGSVæRD, DENMARK - 2025/03/27: A view of the logo of Novo Nordisk A/S at the headquarters in ... More Bagsværd. Novo Nordisk A/S is a Danish multinational pharmaceutical company headquartered in Bagsværd. (Photo by Kristian Tuxen Ladegaard Berg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) stock has experienced a significant decline, dropping 35% from over $90 in early March to around $58 currently. Several factors have contributed to this downward trend. The most recent impact stems from Eli Lilly meeting the primary goals in a late-stage trial for its daily diabetes pill. If approved, this pill's convenience could pose a competitive threat to Novo Nordisk's Ozempic injection, potentially leading to market share shifts. Additionally, concerns about Novo Nordisk's pipeline, which is perceived as less diversified than some competitors, alongside rising market competition, have also weighed on the stock. However, we believe that these concerns are now largely reflected in the current stock price. In fact, we consider NVO stock at around $58 to be extremely attractive, making it a compelling buying opportunity. Our view is that there is minimal fundamental cause for concern with Novo Nordisk; its current valuation appears exceptionally low, contributing significantly to its attractiveness. This conclusion is based on a thorough analysis comparing NVO’s current valuation with its operating performance over recent years, as well as its present and historical financial condition. Our assessment of Novo Nordisk across key parameters including Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company maintains very strong operating performance and financial health, as will be detailed further. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, NVO stock’s valuation looks moderate compared to the broader market. Novo Nordisk’s Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Novo Nordisk’s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Novo Nordisk's balance sheet looks strong. NVO stock has been much more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Novo Nordisk's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Based on Novo Nordisk’s exceptionally strong performance across key metrics and its current moderate valuation, we believe the stock is highly attractive at its current price of $58. While past performance is strong, future prospects are also compelling. Novo Nordisk’s sales are forecast to achieve high-teen average growth over the next three years. Coupled with its robust profit margin exceeding 40%, a significant portion of this top-line growth is expected to translate directly into shareholder value. Although challenges such as increasing competition and the potential impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on drug pricing exist, we believe these risks are adequately reflected in the stock’s current moderate valuation. Therefore, we believe that NVO represents a very good buying opportunity at this level. While NVO stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Congress’s Biggest Financial Priority Is “Stablecoin.” What the Hell Is That?

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Instead of tackling crashing markets, Congress is pushing a crypto sector that the Trump family is financially involved in. The Trump administration’s trade war with the world has roiled the stock market and threatens to plunge the country into a recession while jacking up the price of basic supplies. But instead of taking on the financial issues dominating the headlines, the House and Senate are racing to bring stablecoins — a cryptocurrency sector few Americans have even heard of — out from the shadows. The $230 billion stablecoin industry could be the first to benefit from Donald Trump’s promise to make the U.S. the world’s “crypto capital of the planet.” “Passing legislation gives them a first-mover advantage to profits that are to be gained.” Industry advocates say the legislation will clear up uncertainty around the regulation of their cryptocurrencies, unleashing a new era of financial innovation. Critics of the bipartisan push warn that the legislation risks another financial crash while enriching Trump, whose family is launching a stablecoin of their own. “Passing legislation gives them a first-mover advantage to profits that are to be gained. We saw that with the Trump meme coin, where a lot of people lost out but it didn’t matter because Trump’s platform was making fees,” said Mark Hays, of the group Americans for Financial Reform. “It just seems like a witches’ brew of problematic things that could lead to another crash.” To their proponents, stablecoins offer all the benefits of crypto without the downsides. They are pegged to real-world currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. The idea is that one dollar-denominated stablecoin can always be redeemed for one dollar. Stablecoin issuers use real-world assets, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, to back their offerings. Stablecoins live on blockchains — cryptographically protected digital ledgers — just like more famous tokens like bitcoin or Ether. Unlike bitcoins, they are supposed to be insulated from wild price swings by their currency pegs. That hasn’t stopped some stablecoins from collapsing. Boosters say that stablecoins can make payments faster, cheaper, and more efficient. They argue that stablecoins will make it easier to send money across international borders and create opportunities for the unbanked by cutting out traditional financial institutions. So far, however, they’re mostly used to buy other cryptocurrencies. Crypto traders use them to cash in and cash out of more speculative tokens without paying repeated fees. Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has likened them to “poker chips at the casino.” Critics say that even though the biggest stablecoin was launched in 2014, the high-minded talk of improving the payment system has yet to produce results, and the only major users so far have been crypto traders, criminals seeking to evade money laundering laws, and people in the developing world whose own currencies face runaway inflation. “They have been around for a decade. There is no doubt people have been trying to turn them into a general-purpose payment instrument,” said Arthur Wilmarth, a professor emeritus at the George Washington University law school. “And it really hasn’t worked out.” That’s what their promoters would have you believe. In reality, stablecoins have “depegged” from the dollar dozens of times. As Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange collapsed in late 2022, leading stablecoin issuer Tether saw its titular offering drop from the dollar by more than 2 cents. The second-biggest stablecoin, Circle’s USD Coin, dropped more than 13 cents amid revelations that many of its cash assets were jeopardized by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Then there was the notorious TerraUSD coin, an “algorithmic” stablecoin that was not backed by real-world assets. Its collapse took the token’s supposed value of $40 billion down to zero. Despite the promise of more concrete assets backing today’s leading stablecoins, even crypto boosters have questions about Tether. The El Salvador-based stablecoin keeps only 82 percent of its reserves in cash or cash-like instruments, dividing up the rest in more volatile investments such as bitcoin. Moreover, it has never subjected its reserve to a full financial audit. Tether is closely aligned with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose former firm Cantor Fitzgerald holds much of the Tether’s U.S. Treasury bonds. The very promise of stability can lead to runs on stablecoins, experts say. “If people think that even a few pennies of their dollar are at risk, they are going to run,” Wilmarth said. “They are not thinking, ‘I’ve put this money in the S&P 500, and I’ll ride it up and down.’” Trump has said he wants to sign a stablecoin bill by August. If it does, the legislation would be one of a handful of signature initiatives he approves this year — raising the question of why this niche topic is so important to Congress and the White House. Even supporters of the idea of passing stablecoin legislation say the urgency seems to be motivated in large part by the industry’s torrent of campaign spending. “That has had an effect,” said Tim Massad, the director of the Digital Assets Policy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, who served as the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under Barack Obama. “There’s a valid substantive reason to prioritize it, in that stablecoins exist and we have been talking about it for a while, and I think there’s also some political reason why it’s being prioritized.” Two bills pending in Congress, the STABLE Act in the House and the GENIUS Act in the Senate, would largely accomplish the same industry-friendly goals if passed. Both bills would carve stablecoins out from securities law and the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. And both would allow some stablecoin issuers to opt for state-level regulation instead of federal, potentially letting them to shop for friendlier jurisdictions. The bills would also create reserve requirements limiting what stablecoins can use as collateral, prohibiting them from investing in riskier assets such as bitcoins. That is also where critics start to see problems: The Senate bill would allow stablecoins to use money market funds, which had to be bailed out by the federal government in 2008 and 2020, as collateral. Meanwhile, both bills would ban regulators from imposing tighter reserve requirements designed to protect against market crashes. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

By signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Neither bill goes far enough to outlaw foreign issuers of dollar-denominated stablecoins, potentially creating an incentive for issuers to move offshore and outside of U.S. regulation, according to Massad. And neither provides the Treasury Department with broad-enough authority to crack down on illicit finance, he said. Moreover, both bills would allow non-banks to enter the stablecoin market, Wilmarth said, opening the door for Big Tech companies such as Meta or Amazon to get in on the action. “Not only Big Tech but Big Finance,” he said. “They would have every piece of information about you if they could run all your basic financial transactions through their systems. I think that creates enormous concerns and problems.” If Big Tech does enter the stablecoin market, critics warn, a run on their coins could lead to a larger financial contagion. “You’re linking the commercial sector of our economy to our financial sector,” Wilmarth said. “Mark Twain supposedly said, ‘You can put all your eggs in one basket, but you better watch that basket.’” Last month, members of the Trump family announced that they were getting in on the stablecoin game themselves through their World Liberty Financial venture. The firm is helmed by the sons of Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Like other stablecoins, it promises to be backed by assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds, with regular audits of its reserves. Massad said he could think of no similar move by other presidents. “Jimmy Carter put his peanut farm in a trust, but peanut farm regulation wasn’t exactly a big issue back then,” Massad said. “I think it’s totally inappropriate for the president or members of his family to be launching a stablecoin or otherwise engaging in crypto businesses.” The announcement of the Trump stablecoin didn’t just add another potential conflict of interest to the mountain of existing ones. It also alarmed crypto industry figures, who had been counting on stablecoin legislation as a surefire win this Congress after spending hundreds of millions of dollars on politicians in both major parties during last year’s election cycle. Both bills seemed destined to attract widespread, bipartisan support until the Trumps entered the picture. Instead, at a House Financial Services Committee meeting earlier this month, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the ranking member of the committee, denounced the Trumps and said she could not be involved in passing a bill that would further enrich them. The House bill still passed out of committee with support from six Democrats, giving it a bipartisan sheen. The Senate’s stablecoin bill is co-sponsored by Republican Sens. Bill Hagerty, Cynthia Lummis, and Tim Scott, along with Democratic Sens. Angela Alsobrooks and Kirsten Gillibrand. WAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn’t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren’t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don’t have ads, so we depend on our members to help us hold the powerful to account.

Title: Tesla’s caught in a trade war trap. Blame Elon Musk

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Like many American manufacturers, Tesla is caught in a bind thanks to President Donald Trump’s trade war. Unlike most of those other companies, though, Tesla has an added wrinkle – its CEO, Elon Musk, sometimes called the First Buddy for the close relationship he’s cultivated with the president. On Tuesday, Tesla reports earnings; that afternoon, Musk will take questions from investors. But there is a catch-22: If Musk continues his close ties to Trump, the company could alienate potential customers, both at home and overseas, who dislike Trump’s policies. If he distances himself from Trump, though, he risks the ire of the White House. It’s a lose-lose situation, and it’s a trap of Musk’s own making. The first quarter saw the company’s largest drop in sales after virtually nonstop double-digit sales growth. But the automaker’s finances are only part of what investors will want to know. Reassuring responses on any these topics could help reverse the slide that has wiped out about half of Tesla’s share value (TSLA) since mid-December — and perhaps restore some faith in the company. Dan Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities and longtime Tesla bull who nonetheless recently slashed his price target for Tesla shares, said Musk is facing a “code red situation” if he continues his high profile role in the Trump administration. Blaming brand damage for falling sales, Ives said in a note to clients on Sunday that “Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time.” Beyond the Musk backlash, Tesla is also facing growing competition from other EV automakers, especially in China. Bad news on any of these fronts could cause a new downward spiral for the shares. “It’s turned into a nightmare for Tesla and for investors,” Ives told CNN. “The tariffs, the DOGE controversies, the brand damage — it’s been a perfect storm.” In some ways, Tesla is less exposed than other automakers to Trump’s auto tariffs. It does not import cars from its two overseas factories, and it uses fewer foreign parts in its US-built vehicles than other automakers. All other major automakers also have at least some imported vehicles in their American dealerships. It has stopped taking new orders in China for its higher-priced Model S and Model X cars, which are built in California, due to China’s 125% retaliatory tariffs, but those models are only a small fraction of its overall sales. But Musk has said that the cost to Tesla will be “not trivial.” “Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,” he said on his social media platform, X, the day after Trump’s auto tariff plans were announced. But too much criticism of tariffs during Tuesday’s call could harm his bromance with Trump. Musk became Trump’s largest financial donor last year and has been among his closest advisors since the inauguration. Tesla shares nearly doubled in value in the two months after the election as some investors and analysts hoped Musk would influence Trump to implement Tesla-friendly policies, most notably on self-driving vehicles. Conversely, strong support for Trump’s tariff policies could anger Chinese authorities and EV buyers. China is the world’s largest auto market and EV market, but its consumers are increasingly turning to rivals such as China’s own BYD. Tesla booked $20.9 billion in sales in 2024 in China, about 21% of its revenue, its second-largest market after the United States. Ives called China “the linchpin to the future success of Tesla.” He warned that “the backlash from Trump tariff policies in China and Musk’s association will be hard to understate.” Protests outside Tesla showrooms and vandalism at its facilities underscore the backlash the company and its CEO are facing. Some of the most popular investor questions on Tesla’s site touch on that issue. “Did Tesla experience any meaningful changes in order inflow rate in Q1 relating to all of the rumors of ‘brand damage’?” read one question endorsed by more than 1,000 investors. “How is the company planning to deal with the impact of Elon’s partnership with the current administration?” asked another popular investor question. Another asked: “Boycotts, protests, vandalism, negative headlines, and a stock slide have been sparked by Elon Musk’s participation in changes to U.S. gov’t services & employment. Is the Tesla board discussing whether their CEO should focus fully on Tesla and leave gov’t to elected politicians?” When Musk held an all-hands meeting for Tesla employees last month, it sparked a one-week rally in its battered shares. But the rally proved short-lived. On April 2, when Tesla reported its biggest-ever year-over-year drop in quarterly sales, shares fell sharply — until Politico ran a story later that morning that Musk would soon give up his role in the government. The news lifted shares. However, Musk and other members of the administration said the story wasn’t accurate. “Tesla’s first quarter sales and production report causes us to think that — if anything — we may have underestimated the degree of consumer reaction,” JPMorgan Chase analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about its sales or the impact that Musk’s role in the administration had on those sales. Musk has made ambitious promises for a fleet of self-driving robotaxis and humanoid robots, claiming that they will make the company the most valuable in the world. He had touted plans for a driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, due to start in June. But there have been no updates. Meanwhile, Uber and Google’s own driverless car unit, Waymo, has beaten Tesla to the punch with the start of its own joint driverless taxi service in that city. “It would be a huge negative for the stock if he pushed back (the robotaxi plans),” Ives said. “We need to hear good news there, because there’s not going to be good news in terms of earnings or what the rest of the year will look like financially.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: CE 100 Index Slips 0.2% as United Healthcare Plunges After Earnings

The CE 100 Index barely budged in a holiday-shortened trading week, down 0.2%. Earnings continued to dominate the headlines, and six pillars were lower, while five gained marginal ground. United Healthcare Declines on Medicare Advantage Outlook Leading to the downside in the “Be Well” segment of the CE 100 Index, which lost 3.7%, United Healthcare shares plunged 24%. The company reported earnings that CEO Andrew Witty said, showed “overall performance that was frankly unusual and unacceptable,” according to remarks on the conference call with analysts. The company lowered its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to $26-$26.50 per share, down from $29.50-$30. Revised guidance was lower than the Street expected, and the outlook was driven in part by “heightened care activity indications within [its] Medicare Advantage businesses, which became visible as the quarter closed, far above the planned 2025 increase, which was consistent with the elevated levels in 2024,” the release said. “This activity was most notable within physician and outpatient services.” Nvidia shares lost more than 8%, taking the Enablers segment of the CE 100 Index 2.3% lower. Nvidia said Monday (April 14) that its artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers will be built in the U.S. for the first time, starting in the next 12 to 15 months. The company is working with manufacturing partners to build two manufacturing plants in Texas — one in Houston with Foxconn and one in Dallas with Wistron — and expects to begin mass production within that timeframe. Also within the Enablers group, and as reported this week, the antitrust case against Meta Platforms in federal district court began with FTC attorney Daniel Matheson telling the judge Meta “decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,” according to reports from inside the courtroom. The FTC is seeking to force Meta to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the commission originally had approved in 2012 and 2014, respectively. The tech giant has countered that the case is “weak” and that the case engages in “revisionist history.” Payments-related names countered some of these losses. BNPL stalwart Sezzle was 16% higher. FIS shares were 3.1%. Global Payments sold its issuer solutions business to FIS for $13.5 billion and bought Worldpay for a net price of $22.7 billion. Worldpay is co-owned by FIS and private equity firm GTCR. PayPal shares lost 2.5%. The company announced that it and TerraPay are teaming to promote cross-border payments in the Middle East and Africa. The partnership is designed to speed cross-border money movement, while making payments more accessible by connecting banks, mobile wallets and financial institutions. TerraPay — via secure PayPal account linking — will act as an enabler, allowing mobile wallet and bank users across the MENA region to transfer funds to their PayPal accounts. American Express shares were up a slight 0.1%. PYMNTS’ coverage of first quarter earnings indicated that FX-adjusted basis, revenue rose 8% year over year — or 9% when factoring out the leap year impact — to $17 billion. Total Card Member spending also grew at 7% excluding the extra day. The full-year forecast for 8% to 10% revenue growth and earnings per share between $15 and $15.50, the ranges first set in January. “Our millennial and Gen Zs are performing significantly better both from a FICO perspective and from a delinquency perspective than the industry,” CEO Stephen Squeri said on the conference call with analysts.

Title: POLL: 81% of Americans fear job loss amid surging layoffs and economic uncertainty

A survey reveals 81 percent of U.S. workers fear unemployment in 2025, with 20 percent feeling "much more worried" than in 2024, as layoffs rise and economic instability grows. The survey reveals that employees are having a pessimistic labor market outlook, with 76 percent predicting increased layoffs, 92 percent preparing for a recession, 63 percent expecting more business closures and 52 percent anticipating worsening burnout due to workload and job insecurity. With "The Great Stay" trend, employees hesitate to switch jobs due to uncertainty â only four percent feel completely secure, while 61 percent plan to upskill to stay competitive. There are also several key burnout drivers, including job insecurity (43 percent), increased workloads (29 percent) and poor work-life balance (23 percent). Analysts attribute worker anxiety to unpredictable layoffs, economic shifts and eroded trust in once-stable institutions, calling it a rational response to systemic instability.

Analysts attribute worker anxiety to unpredictable layoffs, economic shifts and eroded trust in once-stable institutions, calling it a rational response to systemic instability. A new survey has revealed that theÂ vast majority of U.S. workers are deeply concerned about losing their jobs in 2025, as layoffs continue to rise and economic instability looms. According to a report by My Perfect Resume,Â titled "The Great Stay: 2025 State of the Labor Market," 81 percent of workers fear job loss this year, with 20 percent feeling "much more worried" about unemployment than they did in 2024. The survey, conducted among 1,115 employees on December 2024, reveals staggering levels of anxiety, with 76 percent of respondents predicting an increase in layoffs this year, 92 percent preparing for a possible recession, 63 percent believing more business will shut down in 2025 compared to 2024 and 52 percent anticipating worsening burnout rates due to increased workloads and job insecurity. (Related: Layoff saga continues as 12 more companies announce mass employment terminations.) In line with this, the new trend of the "Great Stay" has emerged â a reluctance among employees to leave their current positions amid economic uncertainty. For instance, only four percent of workers reported feeling completely secure in their jobs, while 20 percent are "much more worried" about job loss than in 2024. Additionally, 61 percent of the respondents plan to upskill this year to remain competitive, while 31 percent are considering it. Moreover, the survey reveals that economic instability is fueling workplace stress, with 43 percent of respondents citing job insecurity as the top driver of burnout. Other contributing factors include increased workloads (29 percent), lack of work-life balance (23 percent) and poor management or workplace culture (three percent). Experts: Employees are not overreacting Experts who commented on the results claimed that employees are not overreacting; they're simply responding to an unpredictable job market that offers little reassurance. CEO Patrice Williams Lindo of Career Nomad stated that layoffs have been occurring "in an unpredictably regular fashion since the start of the year," leaving employees feeling uneasy. "The economy feels unpredictable. Tariffs are shifting. The news cycle is nonstop. Workers are tired of being caught off guard and the anxiety is palpable," Lindo said. "It's not just fear of job loss â it's fear of being forgotten, left behind or forced to start over without a safety-net income, financial security or health insurance, just to name a few. Even high performers are staying put in jobs they've outgrown, not because they want to, but because it feels safer than stepping into the unknown right now." Meanwhile, Adriana L. Cowdin, an entrepreneur and executive coach at Be Bold Executive Coaching, said the current turbulence does not compare to past crises but has still created a "uniquely destabilizing" atmosphere. Institutions once considered stable, including government jobs, are now signaling that "nothing is guaranteed." "I've seen how political and economic shifts shape job security perceptions â whether it was the dot-com crash in 2000, the ripple effects of 9/11, the 2008 financial collapse or the COVID disruptions," she said. "When that sense of predictability vanishes, people naturally start to wonder: If I can't count on the market, the government or long-tenured companies to stay steady, what can I count on? It's a logical emotional response. We're hardwired to spot patterns and protect ourselves from risk."

Sources include: YourNews.com MyPerfectResume.com Newsweek.com Brighteon.com The survey, conducted among 1,115 employees on December 2024, reveals staggering levels of anxiety, with 76 percent of respondents predicting an increase in layoffs this year, 92 percent preparing for a possible recession, 63 percent believing more business will shut down in 2025 compared to 2024 and 52 percent anticipating worsening burnout rates due to increased workloads and job insecurity. (Related: Layoff saga continues as 12 more companies announce mass employment terminations.) In line with this, the new trend of the "Great Stay" has emerged â a reluctance among employees to leave their current positions amid economic uncertainty. For instance, only four percent of workers reported feeling completely secure in their jobs, while 20 percent are "much more worried" about job loss than in 2024. Additionally, 61 percent of the respondents plan to upskill this year to remain competitive, while 31 percent are considering it. Moreover, the survey reveals that economic instability is fueling workplace stress, with 43 percent of respondents citing job insecurity as the top driver of burnout. Other contributing factors include increased workloads (29 percent), lack of work-life balance (23 percent) and poor management or workplace culture (three percent). Experts: Employees are not overreacting Experts who commented on the results claimed that employees are not overreacting; they're simply responding to an unpredictable job market that offers little reassurance. CEO Patrice Williams Lindo of Career Nomad stated that layoffs have been occurring "in an unpredictably regular fashion since the start of the year," leaving employees feeling uneasy. "The economy feels unpredictable. Tariffs are shifting. The news cycle is nonstop. Workers are tired of being caught off guard and the anxiety is palpable," Lindo said. "It's not just fear of job loss â it's fear of being forgotten, left behind or forced to start over without a safety-net income, financial security or health insurance, just to name a few. Even high performers are staying put in jobs they've outgrown, not because they want to, but because it feels safer than stepping into the unknown right now." Meanwhile, Adriana L. Cowdin, an entrepreneur and executive coach at Be Bold Executive Coaching, said the current turbulence does not compare to past crises but has still created a "uniquely destabilizing" atmosphere. Institutions once considered stable, including government jobs, are now signaling that "nothing is guaranteed." "I've seen how political and economic shifts shape job security perceptions â whether it was the dot-com crash in 2000, the ripple effects of 9/11, the 2008 financial collapse or the COVID disruptions," she said. "When that sense of predictability vanishes, people naturally start to wonder: If I can't count on the market, the government or long-tenured companies to stay steady, what can I count on? It's a logical emotional response. We're hardwired to spot patterns and protect ourselves from risk."

All the sales were in January and February when Meta’s stock was still trading above $US600, hitting a peak of more than $US736 on Valentine’s Day. The social-media company’s share price has since slid 32 per cent amid the broader market sell-off. Another top seller was Safra Catz, Oracle’s chief executive officer, who unloaded 3.8 million shares worth $US705 million before the tech giant’s stock fell more than 30 per cent. Those proceeds, combined with her remaining stake and investment portfolio, give her a fortune of $US2.4 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is valuing her net worth for the first time. Dimon, CEO of the largest US bank, sold about $US234 million of stock during the quarter. He has a net worth of $US3 billion, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index.

While technology stocks surged early in Trump’s presidency, the uncertainty over tariffs in the lead-up to April 2 – his so-called “Liberation Day” – helped prompt a sell-off that chopped trillions of dollars off global markets. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, has seen his wealth tumble $US129 billion so far this year as uncertainty over tariffs, which could affect everything from phones to semiconductors, have hit tech industry stocks hard. Already, some billionaire insiders are using the opportunity to buy shares at depressed prices and increase their stakes. Insider selling overall was down compared with the first quarter of 2024, when 4702 insiders unloaded shares worth a total of $US28.1 billion, compared with $US15.5 billion from 3867 sellers this year, according to Washington Service.

Title: Weekly news roundup: Huawei accelerates, Nvidia reels, and TSMC anchors next wave of US chip reshoring

Credit: AFP These are the most-read DIGITIMES Asia stories from the week of April 14 – April 20. Huawei unveils new AI chip just one day after US bans Nvidia's H20 exports Just one day after the US banned exports of Nvidia's H20 AI chip to China, Huawei launched its Ascend 920 on April 10. Slated for mass production in late 2025, the chip delivers over 900 TFLOPS, 4,000 GB/s bandwidth, and supports HBM3—offering a domestic alternative as China accelerates efforts to localize its AI compute infrastructure. Tariff maze deepens: US duties on Chinese goods up to 245% amid policy whiplash The Trump administration has issued nine tariff updates since January 2025—nearly equaling the previous two years combined—creating chaos for Chinese exporters. While devices like smartphones and laptops received temporary relief at 20%, tariffs on key tech exports now reach 245% for EVs, 195% for silicon wafers, and 70% for semiconductors. The layered tariffs, drawn from both Biden-era and Trump's ongoing retaliatory measures, create a convoluted regime with rates ranging from 20% to 245%, not including extra global duties on EVs, steel, and aluminum. TSMC hikes 4nm pricing; US clients scramble under tariff pressure Trump's tariff push has driven Apple, Nvidia, and AMD to increase orders at TSMC's Arizona fab, despite a 30% price hike tied to limited 4nm capacity. TSMC is now producing Nvidia's Blackwell chips and AMD's fifth-generation EPYC processors, with a 2nm "Venice" chip also taped out. Output is capped at 20,000–30,000 wafers per month, intensifying competition. Nvidia's US-based production, backed by Foxconn, Wistron, and Amkor, could total US$500 billion over four years. Analysts expect second-quarter revenue at TSMC to climb nearly 10%. Nvidia's China strategy set back by new US ban on H20 chip The US has imposed an indefinite export ban on Nvidia's H20 AI chip, citing risks of its use in Chinese supercomputers. Nvidia responded with a US$5.5 billion charge tied to inventory and commitments, sending its stock down 5% in after-hours trading. The restrictions also apply to AMD's MI308 chip and threaten key Chinese deals, including orders from Alibaba, delivering a major blow to Nvidia's China strategy. TSMC, Foxconn, and Wistron join Nvidia's US$500B push to manufacture AI chips and servers in the US Nvidia plans to produce up to US$500 billion in AI infrastructure in the US over four years, aligning with Trump's push for domestic manufacturing. Production of Blackwell chips has begun at TSMC's 4nm fab in Arizona, while Foxconn and Wistron prepare to build AI servers in Texas. Amkor and SPIL will manage packaging, establishing the first end-to-end US-based AI chip supply chain. Nvidia is targeting cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, set to spend US$371 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, with its US-based gigawatt-scale chip buildout. Trump hailed the initiative as a flagship success of his "America First" industrial policy. AMD advances US chip strategy with TSMC, joining Nvidia in massive domestic shift During her April 15 visit to Taiwan, AMD CEO Lisa Su confirmed that wafer production has started at TSMC's Arizona fab, with mass production of fifth-generation EPYC chips underway. AMD also unveiled its MI350 AI chip, built on TSMC's 3nm node with CDNA 4 and HBM3E, claiming 1.2x efficiency over Nvidia's B200. As tariffs reshape the tech supply chain, AMD joins Nvidia and Apple in expanding US-based production. TSMC projects second-quarter revenue growth of 5–9%, though demand may soften later due to frontloaded orders. Micron reportedly secures Nvidia certification for fifth-gen 12-layer HBM3E supply Micron has reportedly secured Nvidia's certification for its fifth-generation 12-layer HBM3E and will supply it for the Blackwell Ultra (GB300) AI chip. With mass production underway, Micron aims to lead HBM3E shipments by late 2025. Currently holding 5% of the HBM market—compared to SK Hynix's 53% and Samsung's 42%—Micron's entry into Nvidia's supply chain could reshape the competitive landscape. Article edited by Jack Wu

Title: Tesla's biggest fan on Wall Street says Elon Musk faces a 'Code Red Situation'

One of the biggest Tesla (TSLA) bulls on Wall Street says it’s time for Elon Musk to change the narrative about his EV maker. With Tesla set to report earnings on Tuesday after the ball amid slumping sales and a cratering stock, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Musk’s latest “turnaround vision” must begin with Musk’s earnings call. Ticking off the slew of setbacks Tesla has faced this year — from becoming “a political symbol” and brand damage to “protests and violence against Tesla dealerships” and new tariffs — Ives said “we are now at a major crossroads for the Tesla story.” “So why stay bullish? It’s a great question,” Ives wrote in a Sunday note. “We believe Tesla along with Nvidia (NVDA) are two of the most disruptive technology companies on the globe over the coming years. The unparalleled innovation, engineering scale, autonomous roadmap, and robotics future will unleash massive valuation upside over the coming years in our view. From earlier this year: Elon Musk is distracted. Tesla stock is cratering. Some investors want a change But Ives also said it’s time for Musk to leave his position in the Trump administration leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Wedbush said Musk faces a “Code Red Situation” if he stays at DOGE. “Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,” Ives said. “Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla... and anyone that thinks the brand damage Musk has inflicted is not a real thing... spend some time speaking to car buyers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. You will think differently after those discussions.” “We view this as a fork in the road time,” Ives wrote. “If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage... but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO to drive the vision and the long term story will not be altered. If Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow. Wedbush still maintained its Outperform rating on Tesla stock. The shares were down more than 5% in Monday morning trading, and have fallen almost 40% so far this year. Tesla is no longer selling the majority of electric cars registered in America’s biggest electric vehicle market. The automaker has lost significant ground in California, which accounts for almost a third of all zero-emission purchases in the country According to a publication sponsored by the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA), Tesla’s share of the state’s EV market fell to 43.9% in the first quarter of this year from 55.5% a year ago. Tesla registrations in the first quarter of 2025 fell over 15% from a year earlier — while registrations for all other EVs increased by 35%. Musk was a major supporter of Trump during his presidential campaign and transitioned into becoming a senior White House adviser after Trump’s inauguration. He now leads DOGE, which pushes federal agencies to issue mass layoffs and enact other spending cuts, and has frequently weighed in on foreign politics. Protests have been organized at Tesla showrooms and facilities across the country since Trump was inaugurated in January. Many peaceful demonstrations have taken place, including a slew of protests held on Sunday, such as a 300-person rally held at a Tesla showroom in Boston and another at a showroom in Vancouver, Washington. But more than a dozen violent or destructive acts have been directed at the company’s facilities since the inauguration, according to The Washington Post, including one instance where an individual planted a Molotov cocktail near a vehicle. There have also been several reports of individual vehicles or Superchargers being vandalized. —Shannon Carroll and William Gavin contributed to this article.

April 20, 2025 20:47 ET | Source: Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses Exceeding $100,000 In Rocket Lab To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you suffered losses exceeding $100,000 in Rocket Lab between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). [You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

New Delhi: Bhavish Aggarwal is looking to raise up to $300 million for his artificial intelligence venture Ola Krutrim, curtailing his ambitions to snag about $500 million, after seeing poor investor appetite, three people aware of the development said. While there are no concrete investment offers on the table yet for the next round, Krutrim, led by its founder Bhavish Aggarwal, is “confident of bringing multiple big-ticket investors to the cap-table" in the coming months, these people said on the condition of anonymity. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and SBI Capital Markets are the bankers involved in the funding round, one of the persons cited earlier said, adding that Krutrim will raise funds in a mix of debt and equity. The three banks did not respond to Mint’s emailed requests for comment. An Ola spokesperson said the company “does not comment on speculations." Mint could not independently ascertain the valuation being sought by Aggarwal for the latest funding round from investors. Read more: NRAI contests exclusion from CCI confidentiality ring in Zomato antitrust probe Matrix Partners, which initially led Krutrim's first $50-million funding round, is said to be contributing $25 million more in the upcoming round, the second person said. “The company is speaking with a number of top venture capital funds outside of India for additional capital—basing their pitch upon developing indigenous infrastructure and artificial intelligence models. No deal has matured yet," they said. The third person added that the company’s $500-million funding push “was a part of Aggarwal’s effort to complete the $1 billion fundraise before his deadline. That didn’t exactly work out." Aggarwal announced in February that Krutrim will attract investments amounting to over $1 billion by 2026. Krutrim, unveiled on 15 December 2023, is Aggarwal’s moonshot AI project that has claimed it will build foundational models for Indic languages, as well as India’s own graphic processing unit (GPU) chip, to make its own data centres and AI ecosystem. Krutrim is sanskrit for the word 'artificial'. On the 42nd day after the announcement, Aggarwal claimed to have raised $50 million for Krutrim at a valuation of $1 billion. On 4 February this year, Aggarwal claimed to have invested $230 million in Krutrim. This came after Aggarwal pledged about 8% of his shareholding in publicly-listed Ola Electric to raise debt to finance Krutrim's expansion. The funding round could be a key part of Ola’s claim to “make India independent of depending on Western companies for AI," as per Aggarwal’s statement on 15 August 2024. However, the company is yet to showcase the efficacy and veracity of its work at scale—something that investors and sectoral consultants said could be difficult. Read more: For the first time, India to make most of a laptop in-house “Ola is yet to release any peer-reviewed journal on its AI development, or showcase any product implementation at scale to build any kind of investor confidence. There are also major concerns that AI ventures do not necessarily need large funds as the cost of computing reduces, and India focuses on AI applications. Venture capitalists are also cautious as AI continues to change in terms of its fundamental nature, every few weeks. None of this would favour Ola’s push for a massive funding round," said Jayanth Kolla, partner at technology consulting firm Convergence Catalyst. Brain drain at KrutrimMeanwhile, Krutrim continues to lose senior engineers from its AI development. A senior industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter said that Krutrim “is yet to show why it needs sweeping funds to build any AI patent close to being comparable with OpenAI, Meta or Google." “In fact, at this moment, multiple executives including senior ones have left the core Krutrim engineering team that is led by Sambit Sahu," the industry executive said. When contacted directly, Sahu did not respond to Mint’s request for an interview. To make matters worse, India’s investors are not convinced about signing on large cheques to the scale of Aggarwal’s demand. “The investors that can offer such large amounts in funding are all based outside of India. But, the large VCs are focused on personalities who stand out with a world-leading pedigree of AI storytelling and product development. For Aggarwal, this is more difficult to pull off since his core competencies are not in AI," said Kashyap Kompella, AI consultant and chief executive of RPA2AI. Kolla said that relying on SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son—who has backed Ola before—may be out of the question “since Son is focused on pooling in his funds for the US’ Stargate AI initiative." Read more: SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son is making big bets, leaning heavily on borrowing Such a move could hurt Ola’s efforts to achieve its funding goal. Kompella added that the current macroeconomic environment “is not going to help either." “At this moment, Donald Trump’s trade tariffs are causing widespread uncertainties—with the markets fluctuating wildly. When there is business uncertainty, the first thing that is hit is dealmaking. Large funding efforts will thus be only concentrated around a few executives such as Mira Murati (of the OpenAI founding team), who stand out as veterans in the global AI industry, and smaller ventures without a clear-cut sector expertise may struggle to raise massive funding rounds," Kompella emphasized. The fundraising attempt from external investors comes at a time when Ola Electric is facing concerns over profitability and regulatory practices. Currently, it is facing questions from the Union ministry of road transport and highways and Ministry of Heavy Industries over the gap in its sales and registration numbers in the month of February. The government is also questioning the company's servicing capacity after thousands of consumer complaints emerged against its flagship electric scooters. Since debuting at the public markets in August last year at ₹76, its stock has lost more than 30%. From its peak, the share price has lost over 65% value in the past 9 months. On Thursday, Ola Electric's stock closed little changed at ₹50.24 on the BSE. (With Inputs from Sneha Shah) Meanwhile, Krutrim continues to lose senior engineers from its AI development.

70% third-party goods are sourced from China … Key Points Detailed Analysis Stock Performance Amazon’s stock has declined significantly in 2025, with a year-to-date loss of nearly 20% and a 27.03% drop from its all-time high of $242.52 on February 4, 2025, closing at $172.63 on April 17, 2025 [MacroTrends]. Posts on X highlight a 5% dip linked to tariff concerns, with analysts slashing price targets due to uncertainty []. The tariffs exacerbate existing pressures like underperforming segments and slower AWS growth. Tariff Policy and Impact President Trump’s tariffs, escalated to 145% on Chinese imports (125% announced April 2025 + 20% fentanyl-related), target goods critical to Amazon’s e-commerce platform [][].

Profit and Stock Outlook Despite e-commerce challenges, Amazon’s high-margin segments—AWS (13% YoY growth) and advertising ($17.3B in Q4 2024)—provide resilience.

This supports a bullish stock outlook, though short-term volatility persists due to tariff uncertainty. Table: Tariff Impact Summary Conclusion The 145% China tariffs significantly pressure Amazon’s e-commerce business, contributing to its 2025 stock decline through higher costs and supply chain disruptions. While Amazon mitigates impacts via strategic actions, price hikes or reduced sales loom.

Title: Why is Amazon stock down so much

Key Points Stock Performance Overview Amazon’s stock has faced a notable downturn in 2025, with a year-to-date loss of nearly 20% and a significant drop of 27.03% from its peak on February 4, 2025. This decline reflects broader challenges in the tech and consumer discretionary sectors, not unique to Amazon, but the company has seen recent gains evaporate. Analyst and Market Reactions Analyst actions, such as Jefferies lowering its price target from $275 to $250 in early April 2025 while maintaining a “Buy” rating, may have contributed to the stock’s decline. This adjustment aligns with Wall Street’s “Strong Buy” consensus, but it suggests a cautious outlook that could affect investor sentiment. Business Segment Performance Certain business segments, particularly smart home devices, are lagging, potentially dragging down overall performance. While advertising revenue surged to $17.3 billion in Q4 2024, showing 18% quarter-over-quarter growth, this high-margin area hasn’t offset declines in other areas. Competitive Pressures Amazon Web Services (AWS) is growing at 13% year-over-year, slower than competitors like Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet’s Google Cloud, risking market share loss before 2030. Additionally, increased competition in e-commerce post-COVID, with online sales only accounting for 15% of retail, makes it harder for Amazon to achieve the high growth rates it once did, adding pressure on stock performance. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Amazon Stock Decline in 2025 Amazon’s stock has experienced a significant decline in 2025, with multiple factors contributing to its performance as of April 19, 2025. This analysis delves into the detailed reasons behind the downturn, drawing from recent financial reports and market analyses to provide a comprehensive overview. Stock Performance Metrics The stock has seen a year-to-date loss of nearly 20%, a stark contrast to its performance earlier in the year. From its all-time high of $242.52 on February 4, 2025, it has dropped by 27.03%, closing at $172.63 on April 17, 2025, according to historical data from MacroTrends Amazon – 28 Year Stock Price History | AMZN | MacroTrends.

Analyst Sentiment and Price Target Adjustments Analyst sentiment has played a role, with Jefferies lowering its price target from $275 to $250 in early April 2025, as noted in a report from 24/7 Wall St. Amazon Stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 for April 16. Despite maintaining a “Buy” rating, this adjustment reflects a cautious outlook, potentially impacting investor confidence and contributing to the stock’s decline. Business Segment Performance Specific business segments have underperformed, notably smart home devices, which are lagging behind expectations. This segment’s struggles are highlighted in the 24/7 Wall St. report, suggesting it drags on overall company performance. Conversely, advertising revenue showed strength, reaching $17.3 billion in Q4 2024 with 18% quarter-over-quarter growth, but this hasn’t been sufficient to offset declines in other areas Amazon Stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 for April 16. Competitive Landscape and Growth Challenges Amazon Web Services (AWS), a key revenue driver, is growing at 13% year-over-year, which is slower compared to competitors like Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet’s Google Cloud. This slower growth rate poses a risk of market share loss before 2030, as detailed in the 24/7 Wall St. analysis Amazon Stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 for April 16. In e-commerce, increased competition post-COVID has made growth more challenging, with online sales only accounting for 15% of retail sales, making it harder to achieve the high growth rates seen a decade ago, further pressuring the stock. Market Context and Broader Trends The decline isn’t isolated to Amazon; it’s part of a broader tumult affecting tech and consumer discretionary stocks in 2025, as noted in the 24/7 Wall St. report. This context suggests macroeconomic factors and sector-wide challenges are also at play, though Amazon’s specific business issues amplify the impact.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.

Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time.

The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Title: Hertz Stock Up 131% On Ackman’s Iffy Bet Tariffs To Boost Car Value

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Powered by Adelaide, Forbes AI American actor Peter Falk at John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, 1982. (Photo by ... More Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images) Many investors have bet against car rental company Hertz Global. But activist investor Bill Ackman has built a 19.8% stake in the company, according to an April 16 Pershing Square Capital regulatory filing, the Globe and Mail reported. Since April 15, Hertz stock – about 40% of the company’s shares are sold short, according to the Wall Street Journal – have surged 131%. Is now a great time to buy Hertz stock? Here are four reasons to steer clear of these shares: Hertz is pleased with Ackman’s investment. “I am humbled, and we should all feel encouraged by Bill Ackman’s comments and energized by the strong support shown by him,” Hertz CEO Gil West said in a letter to employees, seen by Reuters. Ackman warned investors to be wary of the stock even as he argued Hertz – which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 and now has two business lines: renting vehicles and borrowing heavily to own vehicles -- is undervalued, noted the Globe And Mail. I requested a comment from Hertz and will update this post if I receive a response. On social media, Ackman – who has a large following among individual investors and owns a big stake in Uber – gave three reasons why shares of Hertz could be worth $30 per share by 2029, the Globe And Mail reported. These include the following: While Ackman is right about the industry structure being concentrated, his numbers appear high. Rather than 95% of the market, their combined market share is 83% – Enterprise (39%), Hertz (22%), and Avis/Budget (22%), according to Market.us. Also, I question how successful Hertz’s turnaround is and whether tariffs and the Uber/Hertz partnership will boost Hertz’s value. After hosting a revolving door of CEOs, Hertz has recently contracted unprofitably. Hertz entered bankruptcy in May 2020 and emerged on July 1, 2021, under Paul Stone’s leadership – "returning about $8 a share to stockholders in its exit from chapter 11," noted the Journal. Mark Fields, who served as interim CEO from October 5, 2021, made the decision for Hertz to order 100,000 Teslas. Despite TV ads from Tom Brady promoting the Tesla fleet, consumers did not take the bait, the Journal reported. Hertz’s operating costs rose and in February 2022 Fields was replaced by Goldman Sachs veteran Stephen Scherr who built up the EV fleet. In December 2022, Hertz took a "$168 million charge to settle 364 claims related to the company falsely reporting rental cars as stolen," according to CNN. On April 1, 2024, West – who was previously Delta Airlines chief operating officer -- replaced Scherr as CEO. West cut operating costs by selling a large portion of Hertz’s EV fleet and the associated remote charging network – taking a $200 million writedown, the Journal wrote. The EV blunder reduced Hertz’s earnings, and the company has reported net losses for the last couple of years – including quarterly losses for the most recent five quarters ending December 2024. Moreover, during that time the rental car company’s debt load has increased 6% to $18.3 billion, its equity has plunged 95% to $153 million, and its revenue fell 6% to about $2 billion in the final quarter of 2024, noted the Journal. Ackman sees tariffs boosting the value of Hertz’s fleet of used late-model vehicles. He als0 expects a partnership with Uber to increase the companies’ fleet utilization and profitability. He forecasts President Donald Trump’s 25% levy on imported automobiles will boost the value of Hertz’s 500,000 vehicles by 10% – increasing their value to $13.2 billion. Moreover, the “$1.2 billion gain on its auto assets is equivalent to approximately half of the company’s current market capitalization,” Ackman said in an X post featured by Bloomberg. Ackman’s 10% is at the high end of a range of used car price increase estimates. For example, one analyst expects used car prices to rise between a 5% and 10% in the near future, according to iSeeCars. Of course if that happens, I doubt Ackman expects Hertz to sell all 500,000 of those vehicles. So, as the company replaces older vehicles with new ones subject to tariffs, it is unclear how much of that $1.2 billion value increase the company will capture. Ackman is counting on West to boost Hertz’s stock price. Getting there would require the company to reach the CEO’s operating targets which include $1,500 in revenue per unit, around $30-per-vehicle operating expense, about $300 in depreciation per unit, and an increase in fleet utilization from 80% to 85%, Ackman noted on X. Ackman also floated the idea of Hertz managing a fleet of self-driving vehicles – in its 11,200 global locations – for Uber which is “excited to brainstorm on how we can expand on our relationship,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi posted on X. I question the realism of West’s operating targets. Many economists see tariffs causing an economic slowdown. If that happens, consumers and businesses could cut back on travel – thus lowering Hertz’s revenue per unit. Moreover, with tariffs raising the price of auto parts, vehicle operating expenses could go up rather than fall. Hertz faces other threats – notably a $272 million legal judgment from bondholders who claim the company should have paid them interest during its time in chapter 11. Hertz is appealing the judgment to the Supreme Court. “While the decline of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resumption of global travel rendered Hertz solvent despite the high stakes of this dispute, the nearly $272 million at issue here could make the difference between solvency and insolvency in many cases,” Hertz lawyers wrote in an April 4 petition to the high court featured in a Bloomberg report. Bondholders remain wary of Hertz’s junior bonds. They still trade “around 50 or 60 cents on the dollar,” the Journal reported. Hertz shares are way overvalued in the view of Wall Street. Four analysts who cover the stock set a price target of $2.93 – suggesting the rental car company stock is 181% over-valued. Short sellers may have contributed to this overvaluation by scrambling to repay the shares they borrowed – assuming some of them purchased the stock in a rising market following Ackman’s announcement of his 19.8% stake. I agree with Ackman’s concluding thoughts. “Investing is risky,” he wrote on X. “There are no guarantees of a successful outcome. Caveat emptor.” Consider avoiding Hertz stock.

Title: All-Ireland League: Clontarf and Cork Constitution to meet in heavyweight decider

Pedigree counts. Clontarf and Cork Constitution set up a heavyweight Energia All-Ireland League final next Sunday in the second leg of an Aviva Stadium double with the women’s final after taut, tight, hard-earned semi-final wins over Lansdowne and St Mary’s respectively. Clontarf, the 2022 champions, will thus meet the reigning champions Con in a Leinster-Munster affair. It was always unlikely that the Clontarf-Lansdowne semi-final would scale the heights of the former’s astonishing 49-46 win between the sides at Castle Avenue, which had been played on the club’s all-weather pitch. Aside from the heightened stakes, the heavy rain of the previous 24 hours or so had left the pitch gluey. That said, it was a lively start. The Lansdowne backs had the better individual flair and strike plays, as evidenced by the move from deep which eventually led to outhalf Stephen Madigan cross-kicking perfectly for lock Ruairí Clarke to score. Clontarf began to find more traction and Ben Griffin burst through the Lansdowne defence from Conor Kelly’s pass for scrumhalf Sam Owens to finish. Kelly converted, but his pass was then picked off by Charlie Tector who scored from halfway and added the conversion. But Kelly and ‘Tarf are tough competitors, and after he exchanged penalties with Tector, Clontarf opted for the corner with the last play of the first half for a trademark power play and a try by Griffin which Kelly converted for a 15-13 interval lead. Though scoreless, the second period ebbed consistently. The margins remained tiny and the noise levels ratcheted up before Aaron Coleman won the game’s final penalty to huge home celebrations. Con will be seeking to become the first club to win back-to-back AIL titles since Shannon in 2006 after a 16-8 arm wrestle over newly promoted St Mary’s on an even heavier pitch at Templeville Road. The home side went ahead through a blindside try off a maul by flanker Ethan Baxter but Con availed of successive yellow cards for the influential St Mary’s duo of captain Ronan Waters and fullback Conor Hayes either side of the interval. First James Taylor landed a penalty and then scrumhalf Adam Maher set up captain David Hyland for a try, which Taylor converted. Taylor extended the lead before Hayes trimmed it again. But after Mary’s went to the corner with one penalty to be repelled, Hayes then missed another before Taylor sealed the deal. The promotion/relegation semi-finals featured four wins by just one or two points. Nenagh have moved to within one match of becoming the first Tipperary club in the top flight after a 25-17 win over Blackrock to set up a promotion decider next Saturday at New Ormond Park against UCC, for whom first-half tries by centres by Daniel Squires and Irish Under-20 midfielder Gene O’Leary Kareem helped earn the day’s only other away win to relegate City of Armagh. Trinity earned themselves a Division 1B lifeline with a nerve-jangling 20-18 win over Greystones to earn a promotion/relegation decider against Cashel, relatively comfortable 26-14 winners over Barnhall. Similarly, Navan will seek to avoid relegation in their centenary year after their 29-19 win over Galwegians earned a decider at home to Dungannon, for whom Ben McCaughey’s penalty with the last kick earned a 23-22 win over local rivals Clogher Valley. In the 2B promotion playoff, Skerries’ 27-18 semi-final win over Ballyclare has earned them a decider against Midleton, who beat Dolphin 18-17 in their all-Cork semi-final. Division 1A semi-finals: St Mary’s Col 8 Cork Con 16; Clontarf 17 Lansdowne 15. Division 1A promotion playoff semi-finals: City of Armagh 10 UCC 17; Nenagh Ormond 25 Blackrock College 17. Division 1B promotion playoff semi-finals: Cashel RFC 26 MU Barnhall 14; Dublin University 20 Greystones 18. Division 2A promotion playoff semi-finals: Dungannon 23 Clogher Valley 22; Navan 29 Galwegians 19. Division 2B promotion playoff semi-finals: Midleton 18 Dolphin 17; Skerries 27 Ballyclare 10.

Title: 5 Must-Haves In Your Morning Routine Guarantee Career Success

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. No matter how you start your early morning routines, if you want to be productive and successful, ... More career experts say you should include these five things. A recent TikTok video by @ashtonhallofficial went viral amassing a staggering 109.2 million views. The video showed the creator’s time-stamped morning routine, starting as early as three a.m. The video gained traction as viewers wonder how realistic the routine is for success. After seeing the video, career experts at resume.io decided to offer tips on how five must-haves in your morning routine guarantee career success and boost productivity throughout your workday. On some days, given the daily obstacles many of us face in our jobs, it can feel more productive to hit the alarm, roll over and go back to sleep--especially with threats of inflation, AI competition and massive layoffs. But then reality hits, reminding you that you have to future-proof your job so you don’t end up another statistic. But have you ever been curious about how the rich and famous, with less to lose, start their early mornings? The career experts at resume.io compiled the morning routines of successful CEO billionaires Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook to show they start their morning routines for continued successful workdays. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and worth $202 billion, awakens around 6:30 a.m., according to resume.io and enjoys a screen-free start to his workday. The career experts describe his mornings as slow with family breakfasts and journaling before bracing the workday. They conclude that Bezos’ slow and balanced morning routine proves that productivity doesn’t always require rushing. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, is worth $188.1 billion. Career experts tell us that he starts his day at eight a.m., checking numerous social media platforms like Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp. “Zuckerberg is known for his minimalistic morning routine, including wearing the same style of outfit daily to avoid decision fatigue,” they note. “This habit is also synonymous with other successful people like Steve Jobs and Barack Obama.” Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, worth $2.4 billion, is one of the earliest risers in the business world, according to the career experts. He starts his day between 3:45 a.m. “This may be what inspired TikTok creator @ashtonhallofficial to do the same,” the experts speculate. “Cook uses the early hours to get ahead on emails and current affairs. He also often completes a workout before 6 a.m. Cook credits his structured early starts with helping him stay focused throughout the workday.” You may have already realized that the difference in you and the billionaires is that they have the freedom of going to bed and getting up when they choose. Many of us in the workforce don’t have the luxury of when to hit the hay or awaken in the morning. But research informs us that routines and rituals help with self-regulation and job stress, contributing to productivity and career success. So, it’s important to consider a structured morning to get your workday off on the right foot. Amanda Augustine, career expert for resume.io, explains that you don’t need to wake up at 3 a.m. to be successful. She advises that the key to having a productive morning depends on three factors: consistency, balance and starting the day off on your own terms. Here are Augustine’s habits that can be integrated into a morning routine that guarantees career success. 1. Aim to wake up at a consistent time. “Try waking up around the same time each day to help regulate your body’s natural rhythm,” Augustine suggests. “Over time, your body will learn when it’s time to be alert, helping you avoid grogginess and feel more energized in the morning.” 2. Limit phone use for the first 30-60 minutes. “Resist the urge to jump into emails or scroll through social media—even if it’s what some famous CEOs swear by,” she advises. “Giving yourself some screen-free time in the morning can lower stress levels and help you start your day calmly and with intention, rather than reacting to the noise around you.” 3. Soak in some natural light. Augustine recommends exposing yourself to natural light within the first hour of waking up. “Whether it’s stepping outside or opening the blinds, this simple habit helps reset your internal clock, lifts your mood and supports better sleep at night.” 4. Move your body. “Incorporating movement into your morning—whether it’s stretching, walking or a quick workout—can get your blood flowing, improve your focus, and boost your mood for the rest of the day,” she points out. 5. Set your intentions for the day. “Take a few minutes each morning to jot down your top one-to-three priorities for the day.” According to Augustine, this helps bring clarity to your morning and ensures you’re starting with purpose instead of just jumping into the next thing. "Remember, the key is to build a morning routine that suits your lifestyle. This will make it easier to maintain and more effective in setting you up for long-term success,” she concludes. These five must-haves in your morning routine corroborate studies that show morning contemplation broadens your perspective and reverses negative thoughts such as self-doubt and uncertainty about the future. Whatever you plant in your mind in the early morning will continue to live and breathe within as you face the challenges in the workdays ahead.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Shaken by geopolitical shocks, the S&P 500 was flat last week and the Nasdaq nosed just into the red — but the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished significantly lower, weighed down by a double blow from UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) and Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%). UnitedHealth slashed its full-year forecast after a rough quarter, sending shares tumbling over 20% and dragging the larger index lower. Nvidia also stumbled, dropping nearly 7% after reports of a new U.S. clampdown on AI chip exports to China. Thursday’s further drop pushed Nvidia’s market cap below $2.5 trillion, bringing its total loss to more than $250 billion since the tighter trade restrictions were first disclosed. It wasn’t all red arrows. Hertz (HTZ+3.21%) soared after Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman revealed a sizable stake in the rental car firm — a bullish bet on a company still recovering from post-pandemic headwinds. Eli Lilly (LLY+3.00%) jumped after announcing that its experimental weight-loss pill cleared a key late-stage trial, strengthening its position in the lucrative obesity drug market. Investors now look ahead to a packed week of earnings and economic data, with Tesla (TSLA+1.13%), Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), Lockheed Martin (LMT+0.09%), Boeing (BA+2.21%), AbbVie (ABBV+2.71%), and Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%) all set to report — alongside key releases on PMI, jobless claims, and the Fed’s closely watched Beige Book. Tesla’s results are set to kick things off Tuesday, and the company’s earnings will be one of the most closely watched reports of the week, with signs pointing to a potential tough quarter. Vehicle registrations in California — Tesla’s largest U.S. market — fell more than 15% year-over-year, marking a sixth straight quarterly decline. The company’s share of the state’s EV market also dropped sharply amid growing competition, an aging product lineup, and the controversial public image of CEO Elon Musk. Also on deck: SAP (SAP+0.45%) and Novartis (NVS+1.90%), two European heavyweights that will test investor confidence in multinationals navigating weak demand and shifting interest rate policy. GE Aerospace (GE+2.38%) offers a read on global defense and aviation spending, while Verizon’s (VZ+1.98%) results could reveal whether telecom providers are holding the line on customer growth and capital costs. Other names to watch include Intuitive Surgical (ISRG-0.70%) and Danaher (DHR+2.50%), which will offer clues on whether momentum in medical technology is holding up. Chubb (CB+2.17%) and Lockheed Martin round out the day, with updates from the insurance and defense sectors — both of which tend to attract investors during periods of economic uncertainty. IBM (IBM+1.52%) and AT&T (T+1.94%) will be in focus as bellwethers for enterprise tech and telecom — sectors that have promised stability but face rising pressure to cut costs and defend margins. Boeing also reports, with investors watching for updates on aircraft deliveries and production pace. The company now faces a fresh geopolitical headwind: reports that China has asked its airlines to halt Boeing orders, thrusting the U.S. aerospace giant into the center of escalating trade tensions. While the move won’t impact this quarter’s results, it raises new questions about the strength of Boeing’s international order book and the outlook for global demand. Markets will also be parsing April’s flash PMI data on Wednesday — key readings on both the services and manufacturing sectors, which may reveal whether the economy is cooling fast enough for the Fed’s comfort. Later that day, the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book lands. Published eight times a year, the Beige Book compiles anecdotal reports from businesses across the country, offering a ground-level look at wage pressures, hiring, and consumer demand. It’s less about hard numbers and more about vibes. Alphabet will report earnings under the shadow of a major legal setback. A U.S. federal judge just ruled that the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against Google’s ad tech business can proceed, rejecting the company’s effort to have it thrown out. The lawsuit, which could ultimately force a breakup of Google’s advertising operations, adds a layer of uncertainty to a business already under pressure. While investors are hoping to see continued AI progress and cost control, shares remain down about 20% this year. Procter & Gamble, Merck (MRK+0.18%), T-Mobile (TMUS+2.22%), and PepsiCo (PEP+1.84%) all report Thursday, too, offering a cross-sector pulse check on consumer spending, pricing power, and healthcare demand. Also reporting: Union Pacific (UNP+1.88%), Gilead (GILD+2.77%), and Comcast (CMCSA+1.99%), bringing updates on freight volumes, drug pipelines, and broadband subscriber trends. You can also expect fresh signals on the health of the labor market and business spending, with jobless claims and durable goods orders both hitting at 8:30 a.m. ET. The numbers could either bolster hopes for rate cuts or cement the Fed’s cautious stance. It’s a fitting end to a high-stakes week: earnings from Charter (CHTR+2.18%), Aon (AON+2.74%), and HCA (HCA+2.17%) will spotlight momentum in media, insurance, and healthcare, while AbbVie, Colgate (CL+1.22%), and a cross-section of energy and services firms round out the picture. Together, they’ll offer a final read on how Q1 really landed — and set the tone for what’s next. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR.

Captioned Bray v. Rocket Lab USA, Inc., No. 25-cv-01733 (C.D.

The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” that alleged, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” On this news, the price of Rocket Lab stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint.

Title: The Nasdaq 100 Big Caps’ Big Price Drops: Apple, Meta, Nvidia Tesla

ByJohn Navin ByJohn Navin, Contributor. Nasdaq 100 These Nasdaq 100 Big Caps peaked months ago and have dropped in price steadily since then. Each stock has a separate, individual story but the Trump administration’s tariffs and their effects on prices play a big part on all of them. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week said that the resulting inflation may affect interest rate policy. It’s not a good mix, according to investors who have shown their dislike by selling the shares of these well-known names. What had been hot stocks are now in the cold as ice territory as the price charts show serious downtrends for each. Wall Street is having second thoughts. Apple daily price chart, 4 19 25 The early April slide below the August 2024 low near 195 is quite dramatic. The gap down from about $220 to just above $205 demonstrates the emotional quality to the selling. That buyers did not show up again until stock reached just below $170 does not instill confidence despite the short bounce that followed. That bounce failed to fill the gap down and the price remains below the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. The tiny red circle shows the spot in early April where the former crossed below the latter, indicating the extent of trend weakness. The iPhone maker has been wounded by the Trump tariffs. Meta Platforms daily price chart, 4 19 25. Meta Platforms Chair, Chief Executive Officer and Controlling Shareholder Mark Zuckerberg cannot be too happy with the recent stock performance of the company. From the February peak of $740 to the current $501 is a two-month drop of 32%. The 50-day moving average is down trending as of late March/early April. The red-dotted line connects the February top with the April high and shows the serious downward slant of the price. Are we about to witness a re-test of the August 2024 low just below the $460 level? Nvidia daily price chart, 4 19 25. The semiconductor giant peaked in January at $152.50 and now goes for $101.49. For those who bought then and continue to hold, that’s a 33% loss. Note that since from that top to early April, the price has shown a series of lower highs and lower lows, the definition of a down trend. The 50-day moving average in mid-March crossed below the 200-day moving average, a further indication of the downward direction of trend. Although the price bounced upward for a few days, it failed to cross above the moving averages. It’s a negative as well that the April low dropped below the August 2024 low. Tesla daily price chart, 4 19 25. The November/December 2024 upward movement bears a certain resemblance to the Seig Heil hand gesture made in public in January by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Since the mid-December peak of $480 the stock has dropped to its present $241. That’s a 41% loss for those who purchased then and held on. The red circle shows where the 50-day moving average recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, an indication of trend weakness. Tesla has managed to stay above the August 2024 low, better than some of the other Nasdaq 100 big caps. A close below that level would not be pleasing to remaining investors.

Despite being mired in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 as a group are expected to grow earning at double the pace of the overall market. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Within the S&P 500, 32 companies reported earnings last week, heavily emphasizing bank earnings. Seventy-one percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the first-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 121 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report, marking the second-busiest week of the reporting season. S&P 500 Earnings Season The financial sector contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement, while downward revisions to the technology sector offset the improvement. According to FactSet data, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 6.1% from 4.5%. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 7.2% year-over-year, equal to the expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings and sales growth rates have faded as concerns about earnings and sales have increased due to the increased tariffs. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Tariff worries weighed on stocks with a 1.5% decline last week. After this week’s pullback, the S&P 500 sits 14% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed last week. The group remains in bear market territory at 26.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Returns Much was made of the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rising instead of falling during the tariff-related stock weakness in the previous week. The typical doomsayers came out in force to predict some new apocalypse, but several less frightening factors seemed to be at play. Last week, the 10-year Treasury yield was back to behaving more typically, with yields falling during the stock market weakness. Most of the decline in yields was from a decrease in the real, after-inflation yield demanded by investors, which reversed some of the increase from the previous week. This means investors are demanding less compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Usually, this happens when expectations for economic growth decrease and investors are more interested in safety versus risk assets like stocks during these periods. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Recently, there has also been some gnashing of teeth about the U.S. dollar’s depreciation against other currencies. This caused the alarmists to spread worries about the U.S. dollar falling out of favor as the global reserve currency. Indeed, the tariffs or falling U.S. yields could result in some rebalancing within currency reserves, but any dethroning of the king dollar remains a minuscule probability. The fact is that there is currently no suitable replacement for the U.S. dollar. This does not mean the U.S. should abuse its status, but overwrought concerns are not yet warranted. A longer-term history of the dollar shows that it has been weaker than its current level most of the time since 1999. US Dollar Woes? Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth, a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, and are currently in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow 14.8% year-over-year versus 7.2% for the rest of the S&P 500. The blended earnings growth rate of the S&P 500 excluding the Magnificent 7 is 5.1%. Two of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Tesla (TSLA) on Tuesday and Alphabet (GOOGL) on Thursday. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Beyond the Magnificent 7, the second busiest week of reporting season has a plethora of notable companies scheduled, including 3M (MMM), Boeing (BA), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Procter & Gamble (PG), and PepsiCo (PEP). According to FactSet data, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 6.1% from 4.5%. The healthcare sector is benefiting from easy comparisons for Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which are both expected to swing from losses in the same quarter last year to profits this quarter. The previous losses were due to the accounting treatment of pharma company acquisitions. If these two companies are excluded, the earnings growth rate for healthcare would be 3.6%, according to FactSet. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal gross domestic product growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.3% has slightly undershot expectations. Consistent with the earnings picture, once the distortions from the healthcare sector’s accounting are removed, the technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Sales Growth By Sector With relatively few top-tier economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. Markets remain very attuned to newsflow around the tariffs, since the size and duration of the tariffs should be positively correlated with the extent of economic growth headwind. Actual economic data has remained relatively resilient despite the tariff storm. On the other hand, soft data from surveys shows the reasons for the consternation about the economic outlook. For example, consumer sentiment readings have plunged. While this plunge does not guarantee an impending recession, it points to at least some economic softness if the 2022 period is a proper corollary. Consumer Sentiment Consumer sentiment remains very dependent on the political party of those surveyed. Just as the opposite was the case under President Joe Biden in 2022, Democratic sentiment has plunged relative to Republicans under President Donald Trump. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party This week’s earnings reports should provide insight into additional sectors and two of the Magnificent 7. With the tariff overhang and growing concerns about the resilience of the artificial intelligence wave, forward earnings guidance from management will be watched even more closely. Consensus earnings growth estimates for the calendar year 2025 earnings have been reduced, even though the first quarter's earnings have arrived as expected thus far. Generally, at 14% off their highs, stocks expect these tariffs to be temporary and a passing headwind for earnings. This expectation could be valid, but there could be more downside if elevated tariffs are viewed as more permanent and likely to send the global economy into recession. Upside could come from significant trade deals that lessen the headwinds or a pivot from the administration away from tariffs. The short-term forecast for stocks seems even more impossible to predict than ever, but the long-term outlook is almost certainly not at risk. Stocks have outperformed cash, bonds, and inflation by a wide margin over the long term despite many setbacks, many much scarier than tariffs or recession.

Investing your money in the stock market is a great way to grow your wealth in the long term, and the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to compound. While that sounds straightforward, current market conditions might give aspiring investors reason for pause. The S&P 500 is down almost 10% year-to-date as stocks continue to sell off from trade war concerns. Kristen Jauregui made it her goal to start investing this year, but she's been discouraged by the market volatility and has decided to wait until things calm down before buying in. The possibility of investing money into the market and immediately seeing it shrink after another tariff negotiation triggers a sell-off is unappealing to her. "It's something that I had been trying to get involved in because it's time to diversify my assets, it's time to grow my money so I have a better future later on, but with the way that everything is shifting right now, I get anxiety reading the news," Jauregui, a 35-year-old payroll specialist, told Business Insider. Harry Woodland started investing in stocks during the week of April 7, just as tariff news was swinging the market wildly. He began by buying ETFs tracking the global stock market and individual companies like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA), he said. "I'm actually investing a little bit after the tariffs came out, so I'm sort of catching up," the 27-year-old, who runs a landscaping business, told BI. "I definitely have concerns about the whole geopolitical situation. It's a very, very volatile market right now." If you're in a similar boat to Jauregui and Woodland, fear not. Katie Klingensmith, the chief investment strategist at Edelman Financial Engines, has the following advice for those who are looking to dip their toes into investing but aren't sure how to start. The most important thing is having a regular plan, according to Klingensmith. It could be as simple as putting $50 into your portfolio every paycheck, as long as you're following a consistent buying schedule — a practice known as dollar cost averaging where you buy when the market is both up and down. This will create healthy financial habits and help you build up your portfolio at a steady pace, she said. "Even if they're relatively small amounts, over the long term those compound dramatically, so investing a little bit early can make a huge difference over the long run," Klingensmith said. You might be tempted to save up your cash and wait until you have a larger sum to invest, but that's not necessary and might actually be suboptimal. It's hard to time the market correctly and enter at the right point. "If you're systematically buying every paycheck, then sometimes you're going to be buying at the absolute cheapest point, sometimes at a medium point, and sometimes at a more expensive point," Klingensmith said. It's OK to not buy in at the low all the time — dollar cost averaging helps investors smooth out the cost of investing. If it's your first foray into the stock market, stick with the basics, like index funds, ETFs, and blue-chip stocks, Klingensmith said. For those with a longer investing horizon, it makes sense to have a higher risk tolerance as there's more time to weather the ups and downs of the market. Younger investors can often put up to 100% of their portfolio into equities and gradually dial down the risk as they age. Woodland's applying this mindset to his investing strategy and taking some risks on individual stocks while he's young. "The Big Tech stuff in my portfolio does worry me a bit, but it's offset by my recovery period. I've got a long time to invest," Woodland told Business Insider. Steer clear of the more complicated investment vehicles though, Klingensmith warns. "Lots of people are talking about private credit, private debt, or real estate," Klingensmith said. "It doesn't tend to be for the smaller investor because at least at this point, those investments are hard to get into and out of." Examples of index funds that provide broad exposure to the market include the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VT), and the iShares MSCI World ETF (URTH). Staying diversified sounds deceptively simple, but it's often hard to heed this tip when the stock market is doing well. For example, if you started investing last year, you might have been tempted to allocate a large portion of your portfolio to Magnificent Seven stocks due to their stellar performance. Now, you might be wishing that you had more exposure to the utilities sector. While it's exciting to invest thematically, such as betting big on the AI trend, that's not the best foundation to base your portfolio on, according to Klingensmith. "The winners within the stock market change. Five years ago nobody would have dreamed that AI would have been this much of a leader in 2024," Klingensmith said. "If you are purchasing a broad basket of securities, you're much more likely to have some winners." Both institutional and retail investors had been betting on US exceptionalism fueling stocks in the last couple of years, but the trade war has proven that the strategy isn't watertight. "Honestly, prior to the tariffs, I would have invested my money into an S&P 500 fund, but I've actually decided to go for the Invesco FTSE All World fund, mainly because I don't really feel comfortable in investing wholly in US stocks," Woodland said. "Now, I understand that the All World fund is around 60% US stocks. However, I do feel like I can sleep better at night knowing that there is the insurance of having international exposure as well." Before you start investing, you should be aware of your risk tolerance, financial goals, and emotions. Whether you like it or not, investing is an inherently emotional experience, Klingensmith cautions. "I can't say enough that all of us, myself absolutely included, are emotional at times like this, and it's hard not to want to sell investments because they've gone down," she said. Her advice? Don't go for more risky investments if you know you can't handle the stress. Define your financial goals and time horizon, and keep a long-term mindset by avoiding checking on your portfolio daily. Klingensmith added that it's not a bad idea to derisk your portfolio and hold more cash at times. Especially during an economic downturn, keeping cash on hand for easy access can be more valuable than investing in the stock market. "It's OK to focus on that cash cushion in the short term, just given the amount of uncertainty that's everywhere, not just in financial markets," Klingensmith said. Jump to

More hot/cold feedback about how close to the mark one is and players may after time be able to generalise this to learn about likely hiding spots for eggs like in trees, under pot-plants in bushes for example. A quiet revolution is reshaping artificial intelligence, and it’s not the flashy one grabbing headlines. While chatbots and image generators dazzle, reinforcement learning, a method refined in academia over the past two decades, is powering the next generation of AI breakthroughs. Imagine a child learning to ride a bike: no manual, just trial, error, and the joy of balance. That’s reinforcement learning, which is an algorithm that explores, adjusts, and learns from feedback, akin to an Easter egg hunt guided by “warmer” or “colder” hints. This approach isn’t just changing how machines learn; it’s redefining what intelligence means. Illustrating the Three Types of Machine Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement ... More Learning To grasp Reinforcement Learning’s s ascent, let’s first look at the two pillars of traditional machine learning: Both methods shine in their domains, and are used in combination yet they falter where data is scarce or goals are vague. That’s where Reinforcement Learning can help. Global interest in Reinforcement Learning has exploded since nature published two Google papers that ... More used to show how it could be used to train an AI to play Atari games (2015) and then that defeated the worlds Go champion (2016) Reinforcement learning learns by doing, guided only by rewards or penalties from its environment. It’s less about following a script and more about figuring things out. In 2015, Nature published a paper where Google researchers demonstrated how a reinforcement learning trained “agent” mastered Atari games using just screen pixels and the scoreboard. Through countless trials, it learned to win at Space Invaders, Q*bert, Crazy Climber and dozens of other games often with moves that stunned human players. A year later, research also published in Nature, Google used similar techniques to topple the world’s Go champion, which was a milestone once thought to be decades away. Reinforcement Learning thrives where explicit instructions don’t exist. It doesn’t need a mountain of labeled data but instead just a goal and a way to measure success. Reinforcement Learning edge lies in its efficiency and ingenuity: While OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, remains a private company, NVIDIA has become the public face of the generative AI boom. This chipmaker’s value surged from $200 billion to over $2 trillion in just two years. Many believed its advanced hardware, like that produced by NVIDIA, was essential for the massive data centers powering AI solutions from giants like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Microsoft. NVIDIA’s relationship with ChatGPT has been compared to the iconic "Wintel" partnership between Intel and Microsoft during the rise of Windows. NVIDIAGPT Synergy: NVIDIA Share Price (Blue) Surges Alongside ChatGPT Global Search Interest (Green) ... More After Its 2022 Launch However in January 2025, DeepSeek, unveiled a new Large Language Model trained using Reinforcement Learning . This model rivals ChatGPT’s performance while requiring significantly less computational power. The announcement impacted NVIDIA heavily, causing its stock to drop more than 10% and temporarily erasing over $500 billion in value. Investors began to see that advanced AI might not always depend on such resource-intensive hardware. DeepSeek’s research quickly gained traction. Their paper, “DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning,” has been cited over 500 times, making it the most referenced reinforcement learning study of 2025. The work highlights how reinforcement learning can achieve high performance without relying on excessive computing resources.

Its trial-and-error mimics human learning, prompting big questions. If machines can replicate this, what defines intelligence? If they spot patterns we can’t, what might we learn about our world?

Andrew Ng, an AI luminary and educator, touched on this in a chat with Toby Walsh at UNSW Sydney. Reflecting on his 2002 PhD thesis, Ng said, “My PhD thesis was on reinforcement learning… and my team worked on a robot.” His early bets are paying off today. Reinforcement Learning’s potential is vast: think more efficient energy grids, tailored education, or smarter robotics. But its autonomy demands caution and careful thought about the incentives used to train the models. An agent tasked with easing traffic might reroute cars through quiet streets, trade efficiency for disruption. Transparency and ethics will be key. Done right, though, Reinforcement Learning could usher in an era where machines don’t just mimic us but they illuminate new paths forward. Reinforcement Learning isn’t a footnote in AI’s story, it's a pivot. The hunt for smarter, leaner intelligence is on, and reinforcement learning is leading the charge.
