A new Chinese advancement in artificial intelligence, DeepSeek, has left US markets feeling unsettled, triggering corrections in equities and crypto assets. DeepSeek, a startup based in Hangzhou, China, released its open-source large language model (LLM) app for free on Monday morning after reportedly spending only $5.58 million to develop and train it – a small fraction of the cost of ChatGPT, which hasn’t been publicly acknowledged by OpenAI but was estimated to be at least over $100 million. OpenAI is valued at $157 billion and recently pledged to raise $500 billion for AI infrastructure in the United States, but some say such numbers may be called into question given DeepSeek’s apparent cost-efficiency. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, told BBC, “This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn’t necessarily been forefront, so it’s taken the market a little bit by surprise… So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that’s going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they’ve already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure.” US tech billionaire and general partner of Andreessen Horowitz, said that the release of DeepSeek R1 was China’s “Sputnik Moment,” referring to the Soviet Union beating the Americans to space with the first artificial Earth satellite. At time of writing, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) – a member of the “Magnificent 7” – plummeted on Monday and is now down 22% from its January high after losing over $400 billion from its market cap. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices are also down 1.75% and 3.19% respectively on the day. Bitcoin and digital assets followed a similar path. According to crypto data aggregator Coinglass, there have been over $975 million in liquidations in just 24 hours, mostly traders attempting to long Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins with leverage. BTC is trading at $99,789 at time of writing, and virtually all other digital assets are in the red on the day.

By Rita Nazareth, Bloomberg NewsWall Street had a rough start to the week on concern that a cheap artificial intelligence-model from Chinese startup DeepSeek could make valuations of the technology that has powered the bull market tough to justify.From New York to London and Tokyo, equities got hammered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.9% and the Nasdaq 100 slipped 3.7%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers plunged 10% — the most since March 2020. Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the AI frenzy, sank 18% in the biggest market-cap loss for a single stock in market history. With big tech getting crushed, U.S. stocks were set for their worst day since the last Federal Reserve decision that roiled trading.In a rush for safety, defensive industries like consumer staples and health care were bid. Treasuries rallied, driving yields to the lowest levels this year. Haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc climbed. The crypto world got hit, with Bitcoin below $100,000.“What was shaping up to be a big week in the markets got even bigger with the disruption in the AI space,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “That could make this week’s megacap tech earnings even more critical to market sentiment.”Monday’s plunge drove new fissures into a market narrative that prevailed since the re-election of Donald Trump in November, the America-first, tech-fueled uber bullishness that saw a clear upward path for risky assets spurred by deregulation, tax cuts and even government sponsorship of AI investment. Treasury yields slid sharply as haven-seeking investors laid aside concern – for today, anyway – that the new president’s policies will stoke inflation.The severity of the selloff in U.S. assets was proportionate to the weightings of AI-enabled firms in the biggest stock indexes. Even after a recent paring to curb their influence the cohort of Nvidia, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. account for 45% of the Nasdaq 100. It’s more than 30% in the S&P 500, leaving both gauges significantly exposed to concerted drops in those names.“The sudden, adverse market reaction to DeepSeek indicates that some of the key assumptions that have been driving the AI trade, and hence major indices, are getting reassessed today,” said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. “I believe that part of the today’s sudden adverse market reaction was a direct result of a wave of complacency that overtook the equity market The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps slid 3.7%. The Russell 2000 slipped 1.4%. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the VIX — soared the most since mid-December to almost 20.The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%. Bitcoin sank 4.9% to $99,401.98.“I’m hoping this moment encourages everyone to look beyond tech stocks,” said Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “Not because the AI story is doomed, but because there are so many opportunities in unloved sectors that have been ignored for so long. The guts of the market’s foundation are still good, so it’s likely that the dip will be bought here.”At G Squared Private Wealth, Victoria Greene says that while she’s “not convinced the bubble has burst,” one would be “silly” not to evaluate the potential risks.“We are looking carefully at how the market progresses from here and if action needs to be taken to protect and shift portfolio allocations,” she noted. “We are not panickers, so tend to be buyers of big dislocations that are happening in tech, energy, and infrastructure today.”Paul Marino at Themes ETFs, says he likes the fact that people are skeptical.“Anything that goes straight up to the sky parabolic, that’s when I get worried as a long-term investor,” he said.The next leg lower for the biggest U.S. tech stocks may come from the retail crowd, according to Tony Pasquariello at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.“Tactically speaking, I suspect the next few days bring a hurried reduction of length by the retail community,” Pasquariello wrote in a note to clients Monday, adding that hedge funds have been aggressively reducing exposure for months, so this is really about the response of households.However, he’s a true believer in the structural supremacy of U.S. tech companies, which “arguably have only more incentive to spend.”“We don’t know whether this is the ‘Sputnik Moment’ for stocks, but this is certainly a wake up call that we are not the only game in town,” said Paul Nolte at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. “To put these very high valuations in the stocks thinking they have cornered the market is a huge mistake and that is being re-rated.”To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., the idea that DeepSeek’s latest AI model is much more cost effective, and runs on much less-advanced chips, is raising some serious questions about what kind of earnings can be drawn from the AI phenomenon.“If these companies look like they’re going to have a tough time maintaining their earnings growth (chip stocks) or a tough time reaching their earnings growth goals (the “picks and shovels” companies), it’s going to create some serious headwinds for today’s expensive stock market, he noted.In fact, the slide in tech came at a time when the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 times estimated forward earnings, which is significantly above its 10-year average of 22. Nvidia, which has led the way on AI technology, has a valuation multiple of 32.All focus will be on earnings announcements from the likes of Microsoft and Apple this week to restore confidence in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies.Investors are heading into yet another pivotal Big Tech earnings cycle with the companies’ shares near record highs and valuations stretched. A key distinction this time: The group’s profit growth is projected to come in at the slowest pace in almost two years.“This should be a fairly good earnings season, but the bar has been raised and they may not be able to live up to high expectations,” said Dan Taylor, chief investment officer at Man Numeric. “It will be very difficult for the group to perform the way it did last year, especially as valuations have increased.”“We think big tech can keep delivering on earnings, but misses could revive concerns that big capital spending on AI won’t pay off – one of three triggers to dial down our pro-risk view,” BlackRock Investment Institute strategists including Jean Boivin and Wei Li.Metrics like capex-to-sales ratios and free cash flows suggest that, for now, megacap tech firms are not overextended, they said. Overinvestment should be assessed in aggregate, in our view, given AI’s potential to unlock new revenue streams across the economy, they concluded.What exactly is DeepSeek?DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer.

From New York to London and Tokyo, equities got hammered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.9% and the Nasdaq 100 slipped 3.7%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers plunged 10% — the most since March 2020. Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the AI frenzy, sank 18% in the biggest market-cap loss for a single stock in market history. With big tech getting crushed, U.S. stocks were set for their worst day since the last Federal Reserve decision that roiled trading. In a rush for safety, defensive industries like consumer staples and health care were bid. Treasuries rallied, driving yields to the lowest levels this year. Haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc climbed. The crypto world got hit, with Bitcoin below $100,000. “What was shaping up to be a big week in the markets got even bigger with the disruption in the AI space,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “That could make this week’s megacap tech earnings even more critical to market sentiment.” Monday’s plunge drove new fissures into a market narrative that prevailed since the re-election of Donald Trump in November, the America-first, tech-fueled uber bullishness that saw a clear upward path for risky assets spurred by deregulation, tax cuts and even government sponsorship of AI investment. Treasury yields slid sharply as haven-seeking investors laid aside concern – for today, anyway – that the new president’s policies will stoke inflation. The severity of the selloff in U.S. assets was proportionate to the weightings of AI-enabled firms in the biggest stock indexes. Even after a recent paring to curb their influence the cohort of Nvidia, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. account for 45% of the Nasdaq 100. It’s more than 30% in the S&P 500, leaving both gauges significantly exposed to concerted drops in those names. “The sudden, adverse market reaction to DeepSeek indicates that some of the key assumptions that have been driving the AI trade, and hence major indices, are getting reassessed today,” said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. “I believe that part of the today’s sudden adverse market reaction was a direct result of a wave of complacency that overtook the equity market The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps slid 3.7%. The Russell 2000 slipped 1.4%. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the VIX — soared the most since mid-December to almost 20. The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%. Bitcoin sank 4.9% to $99,401.98. “I’m hoping this moment encourages everyone to look beyond tech stocks,” said Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “Not because the AI story is doomed, but because there are so many opportunities in unloved sectors that have been ignored for so long. The guts of the market’s foundation are still good, so it’s likely that the dip will be bought here.” At G Squared Private Wealth, Victoria Greene says that while she’s “not convinced the bubble has burst,” one would be “silly” not to evaluate the potential risks. “We are looking carefully at how the market progresses from here and if action needs to be taken to protect and shift portfolio allocations,” she noted. “We are not panickers, so tend to be buyers of big dislocations that are happening in tech, energy, and infrastructure today.” Paul Marino at Themes ETFs, says he likes the fact that people are skeptical. “Anything that goes straight up to the sky parabolic, that’s when I get worried as a long-term investor,” he said. The next leg lower for the biggest U.S. tech stocks may come from the retail crowd, according to Tony Pasquariello at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “Tactically speaking, I suspect the next few days bring a hurried reduction of length by the retail community,” Pasquariello wrote in a note to clients Monday, adding that hedge funds have been aggressively reducing exposure for months, so this is really about the response of households. However, he’s a true believer in the structural supremacy of U.S. tech companies, which “arguably have only more incentive to spend.” “We don’t know whether this is the ‘Sputnik Moment’ for stocks, but this is certainly a wake up call that we are not the only game in town,” said Paul Nolte at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. “To put these very high valuations in the stocks thinking they have cornered the market is a huge mistake and that is being re-rated.” To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., the idea that DeepSeek’s latest AI model is much more cost effective, and runs on much less-advanced chips, is raising some serious questions about what kind of earnings can be drawn from the AI phenomenon. “If these companies look like they’re going to have a tough time maintaining their earnings growth (chip stocks) or a tough time reaching their earnings growth goals (the “picks and shovels” companies), it’s going to create some serious headwinds for today’s expensive stock market, he noted. In fact, the slide in tech came at a time when the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 times estimated forward earnings, which is significantly above its 10-year average of 22. Nvidia, which has led the way on AI technology, has a valuation multiple of 32. All focus will be on earnings announcements from the likes of Microsoft and Apple this week to restore confidence in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies. Investors are heading into yet another pivotal Big Tech earnings cycle with the companies’ shares near record highs and valuations stretched. A key distinction this time: The group’s profit growth is projected to come in at the slowest pace in almost two years. “This should be a fairly good earnings season, but the bar has been raised and they may not be able to live up to high expectations,” said Dan Taylor, chief investment officer at Man Numeric. “It will be very difficult for the group to perform the way it did last year, especially as valuations have increased.” “We think big tech can keep delivering on earnings, but misses could revive concerns that big capital spending on AI won’t pay off – one of three triggers to dial down our pro-risk view,” BlackRock Investment Institute strategists including Jean Boivin and Wei Li. Metrics like capex-to-sales ratios and free cash flows suggest that, for now, megacap tech firms are not overextended, they said. Overinvestment should be assessed in aggregate, in our view, given AI’s potential to unlock new revenue streams across the economy, they concluded. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops AI models that are open-source, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of the iPhone download charts in the U.S. after its release in early January. The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its R1 release offers performance on par with OpenAI’s latest and has granted license for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it. —UBS Group AG has begun a wave of job cuts in its home market Switzerland, with hundreds of employees receiving notice in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. —AT&T Inc. posted fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street projections, including better-than expected increases in mobile-phone customers and fiber-based internet subscribers, driven by seasonal promotions and bundled product offerings. —Activist investor Ancora Holdings Group has nominated nine candidates for United States Steel Corp.’s board and is pushing for the company to abandon a takeover by Nippon Steel Corp. —SoFi Technologies Inc. published a forecast for profit that missed analysts’ estimates. —MicroStrategy Inc. bought $1.1 billion of Bitcoin, after announcing plans for the early redemption of convertible notes and approving an increase to amount of authorized common shares. —U.S. consumer confidence, durable goods, Tuesday —Fed rate decision followed by news conference by Chair Jerome Powell, Wednesday —Canada rate decision, Wednesday —Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, ASML earnings, Wednesday —Eurozone ECB rate decision, consumer confidence, unemployment, GDP, Thursday —U.S. GDP, jobless claims, Thursday —Apple, Deutsche Bank, Thursday —ECB rate decision followed by news conference by President Christine Lagarde, Thursday —U.S. personal income & spending, PCE inflation, employment cost index, Friday Stocks —The S&P 500 fell 1.9% as of 2:51 p.m. New York time —The Nasdaq 100 fell 3.7% —The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% —The MSCI World Index fell 1.5% —Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index fell 3.7% —Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index fell 10% —The Russell 2000 Index fell 1.4% Currencies —The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1% —The euro was little changed at $1.0492 —The British pound was little changed at $1.2487 —The Japanese yen rose 1% to 154.47 per dollar Cryptocurrencies —Bitcoin fell 4.9% to $99,401.98 —Ether fell 6.7% to $3,075.6 Bonds —The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53% —Germany’s 10-year yield declined four basis points to 2.53% —Britain’s 10-year yield declined four basis points to 4.59% Commodities —West Texas Intermediate crude fell 2.2% to $73.04 a barrel —Spot gold fell 1.2% to $2,738.57 an ounce This story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.

Title: 2:00PM Water Cooler 1/27/2025

Full Content:
Bird Song of the Day Brown Thrasher, Elkinsville Rd. and Kirk’s Ford Rd., Brown, Indiana, United States. Grab a cup of coffee for nineteen minutes of thrashing! * * * In Case You Might Miss… * * * Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * * Trump Administration “Scoop: How Trump’s ‘black box’ limits outside influences” [Axios]. “President Trump is surprising — even frustrating — some longtime friends in his second administration’s early days with fewer leaks, a lack of exploitable rivalries, and tighter restrictions on access to him. Why it matters: No modern president has done more — across more areas of American policy, culture and life — than Trump in the past six days. This new operating style and system enabled a strategy of flooding the nation with so many huge moves that it’s hard for critics to attack specific ones.” And: “It’s stunning to veterans of Trump’s first West Wing. But at least in Week 1, the new government has mirrored the discipline of his 2024 campaign operation — another sharp contrast with his previous teams…. There’s a ‘strong silo system’ that has kept advocates and special interests from forum-shopping and end-running administration officials, the lobbyist added.” Interestingly: “The biggest change of all, Axios has learned, is that White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and other aides have clamped down on the ability of random friends and reporters to call Trump directly. Until now, if you had his phone number and called, Trump would answer and talk to you — and maybe even act on whatever you suggested. Now, Trump wants to focus more on work and has less time for bull sessions so he’s less prone to answer his phone.” • Of course, some might suggest that we want Trump to “work” as little possible. “Confident, organised, still freewheeling: Trump 2.0 has learned from past” [BBC]. “The stacks of leather-bound executive orders piled high on the Resolute Desk illustrate how the Trump 2.0 era is set against a different political landscape from four years ago – one which has produced a more emboldened commander-in-chief…. ‘It’s been much more disciplined, on-point and issue-focused,’ said Lawrence Muir, a former official in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Mr Muir, who was tasked with hiring administration personnel as part of the 2016 Trump transition team, told the BBC his work was ‘essentially discarded’ by the incoming White House at the time. ‘They did not have a great idea about what they were supposed to be producing, or how to produce it,’ he said. ‘[Trump’s] doing much better this time in terms of what he’s getting out, getting it out efficiently, and knowing how it has to be enforced down through the agencies.'” * * * “Trump’s agenda is about to hit a make-or-break moment” [Politico]. “House Republicans are heading to President Donald Trump’s Miami-area resort for their annual policy retreat…. The biggest task for the gathering at Trump National Doral: Finalize a budget blueprint plan for the massive, party-line bill they’re planning, touching energy, border security and tax policy. But to do that, Republicans need to decide what will go in that package — with the price tag of Trump’s priorities reaching $10 trillion over 10 years — versus what might be included in a separate, bipartisan government funding bill that will be negotiated with Democrats over the next seven weeks. The fate of a necessary debt ceiling increase is top of mind…. The planned retreat discussions have been tailored to show attending members the possibilities for the way forward and to take their temperatures on potential spending cuts, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the planning. Leaders will have to carefully balance sometimes competing interests from various GOP factions.” And: “Centrists are also relaying their concerns to GOP leaders about some committees’ plans to target pieces of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that provides food aid benefits for more than 40 million low-income Americans…. Those proposals are relatively more palatable for GOP lawmakers in competitive districts than the massive cuts to current benefits some conservatives would prefer. But they’re still politically divisive and could provide Democrats major campaign fodder in blue and purple districts ahead of the 2026 midterms.” • But cutting Medicaid, though easy and fun, won’t get those trillions. It never does. * * * “Trump actions could wreak havoc on South Florida’s sizeable Colombian population” [Miami Herald]. “Florida is home to 473,606 Colombians, according to the U.S. Census data. The state has long been a magnet for new arrivals from the South American country who are seeking a place where there are many Spanish speakers, a warm climate and a ready-made community.” • Interestingly, the story doesn’t sat what percentage of those new arrivals have their papers in order. “Trump wants to tackle inflation. Will these top actions bring prices down?” [WaPo]. The deck: “Here’s six key actions, executive orders and promises, from this past week and how they would affect inflation.” More: “‘The reality is, inflation of the type we have gets embedded into the economy and takes a long time to wring out,’ said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank. ‘There aren’t many quick solutions.'” Be that as it may, the six: Immigration crackdowns, deportations [▲]; New tariffs and trade policies [▲]; Expanding oil and gas drilling, other energy overhauls [▼]; Rolling back regulations [▼]; Undoing Biden’s efforts to lower prescription drug prices[?]; Lowering interest rates[▲].” • Triangles for what WaPo thinks could go up, or down. “Trump shocks the system. Will he solve problems voters care about most?” [Dan Balz, WaPo]. “The larger issue for Trump, and what ultimately will determine the political and substantive success of his second term, is whether this flurry of activity signaling a major course change will result in the betterment of the lives of the voters who supported him in November. Getting rid of DEI offices and personnel will cheer his most loyal supporters and hurt a federal workforce in a nation becoming more ethnically diverse. It won’t necessarily help families struggling to pay bills. Deporting millions of undocumented immigrants in fact could raise food prices and further labor shortages…. Shocking the system is one thing. Providing tangible results to people is another.” 2028 “The 12 Democrats who make the most sense for 2028” [WaPo]. Starts out well: “Save for a few months at the tail end of the 2024 campaign, the party hasn’t had an authoritative, dominant leader for a long time.” Really? 2024? Who was that? Anyhow, here are the 12, starting with #12: Tim Walz, Josh Stein, Andy Beshear, Gavin Newsom, Raphael G. Warnock, Wes Moore, Ruben Gallego, John Fetterman, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Gretchen Whitmer, and — at #1! — Josh Shapiro. It’s been a long time since I deployed the “Please kill me now” trope…. Our Famously Free Press “Too Much News, Redux” [Jon Allsop, Columbia Journalism Review]. “I noted in 2020 that the ‘basic rhythms’ of the news business aren’t designed to cope with deluges of huge stories: whatever the day’s news, it must be stretched or shrunk to fill roughly the same number of newspaper column inches or cable news hours; the internet, of course, theoretically offers near-infinite space for news coverage to expand, but many digital formats—from homepages to newsletters—themselves have spatial limits, and that’s before we get into strained newsroom resources and apparently diminished audience buy-in, as Stelter pointed out last week. These constraints make it hard for the news media, as a collective apparatus, to communicate proportion. We have tools for organizing stories by importance—back in 2020, I noted that the New York Times had run thirty-three banner front-page print headlines in less than six months, smashing even its election-year average—but the constant blare of headlines, as I noted, can have a ‘flattening effect, making it harder, over a long period of time, to distinguish actual news from attention hustling.’ The problem of proportionality is recurring now. A story previewing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s potentially radical plans to ‘target vaccines’ should he be confirmed as health and human services secretary appeared about halfway down a major Politico newsletter on Friday; yesterday, the CIA lab-leak story made the front page of the Times, but only in brief form at the very bottom. Needless to say that in the summer of 2020, both these stories would have been earth-shaking.” • Allsop complains of Trump’s tendency to make news, or at least news stories — “flood the zone with sh*t” — but I think there are more stories out there, as one would expect as a function of slow civilizational collapse (newsrooms are smaller too). Democrats en déshabillé “Playbook: A tough Week One for Democrats” [Politico]. “On Saturday, at their winter meeting in National Harbor, Maryland, Democrats will make their first consequential decision since their November drubbing: selecting a new chair of the DNC. In the opening days of the new administration, Democrats have struggled to frame Republicans, careening from the critique that Trump has surrounded himself with ‘broligarchs,’ as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) put it, to whether Elon Musk made a Nazi salute. Senate Democrats have zigged and zagged on their Cabinet confirmation votes. Of course, not all nominees are equal. But they are clearly divided over tactics in responding to Trump’s program.” • Maybe — hear me out — the important Democrat problems aren’t at the tactical level? “In the wilderness: Democrats struggle to navigate the politics of new Trump era” [Guardian]. “‘He’s been in office less than a week, and you’ve already seen a federal court with a judge who was appointed by a Republican president – a president that much of the conservative movement in America upholds – say that he’s operating blatantly unconstitutionally,’ said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of the non-profit legal group Democracy Forward. ‘I think what you’re going to see is more sophisticated legal responses this time because civil society, I think, is much more organized and savvy to this playbook.’ Democracy Forward is one of more than 350 organizations that have joined a coalition known as Democracy 2025, which has the explicit aim of ‘disrupting any efforts by the Trump-Vance administration to attack our rights.’ ‘The message that we want to send to all Americans across the country is thbe doing is demanding a president and a Congress that does the same thing,’ Perryman said.” • So, doubling down on lawfare. 350 organizatioat there are lawyers and advocates who are going to be in court every single day fighting for your rights, and what we need to ns is not a sign of strength. It’s a sign of weakness. Nor are these NGOs representative of “civil society” as a whole. “Trump Just Broke the Law. Blatantly. And He Might Get Away With It” [Michael Tomaskey, The New Republic]. On Trump firing the 15 Inspectors General: “Under the original law, presidents had to give Congress 30 days’ notice about their intent to fire an I.G. and just supply some vague reason why. President Barack Obama’s excuse for firing the I.G. of national service programs was simply a lack of confidence in the guy. Then came Trump. As Bob Bauer and Jack Goldsmith wrote at Lawfare in 2022, ‘More frequently than prior presidents, [Trump] manipulated vacancies and related laws to fire or dismiss disliked inspectors general and replace them, pursuant to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA), with a more like-minded or pliant official.’ So Congress, through a larger defense bill, amended the I.G. law by replacing the word ‘reasons’ with the phrase ‘substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons.’ In sum, Congress toughened this law because of Trump. And now, Trump has broken the provision that was added in response to his flouting of the original law! That he broke the law is obvious. He didn’t give 30 days’ notice. He didn’t provide any ‘substantive rationale.’ He didn’t provide any reason at all. He just did it. And he told reporters Saturday that it was all fine. ‘It’s a very common thing to do,’ he said. Once he says that, we know that basically every Republican, and Fox News and Sinclair and the rest of the propaganda chamber, are going to say the same thing. Lindsey Graham on Sunday hilariously admitted that ‘technically, yeah,’ Trump broke the law but Graham wasn’t losing any sleep over it.” • It’s a good thing that four solid years of lawfare (eight, if you count RussiaGate) didn’t make people cynical about Democrat accusations of illegality, because this thing looks like it could have legs. Realignment and Legitimacy “Column: The rise of Silicon Valley, from indifference to lords of the political universe” [Los Angeles Times]. “When the high and mighty of Silicon Valley assumed their privileged perch at the swearing-in of President Trump, it was an ostentatious show of wealth and power unlike any before. ‘You could go back to the Gilded Age and you could have a similar concentration of capital and power. You know, Rockefeller and Carnegie,’ said historian Margaret O’Mara, citing two of the richest men who ever bestrode the earth. ‘But they weren’t on the dais of the inauguration.’…. The explanation for their propinquity lies not in the creation of some whiz-bang, life-changing, paradigm-bending consumer product, or the shining virtues or particularly fertile minds that grace Silicon Valley’s fruited plain. ‘It’s one of the oldest truisms in politics,’ said Larry Gerston, a San José State political science professor emeritus, who’s followed the tech industry from a front-row seat for decades. ‘Money buys access.’ Bezos’ Amazon and Zuckerberg’s Meta were among the tech firms that tithed $1 million each to help pay for Trump’s inauguration. Musk invested more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump. Given his conjoined-twin closeness to the 47th president, it appears money well spent.'” Syndemics “I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD.” –William Lloyd Garrison * * * Covid Resources, United States (National): Transmission (CDC); Wastewater (CDC, Biobot; includes many counties; Wastewater Scan, includes drilldown by zip); Variants (CDC; Walgreens); “Iowa COVID-19 Tracker” (in IA, but national data). “Infection Control, Emergency Management, Safety, and General Thoughts” (especially on hospitalization by city).

From December 5, 2024: “[D]ata strongly suggests that the virus, known as H5N1, has spread primarily* through milk. It replicates quickly in the udders of infected cows, which produce milk with sky-high levels of the pathogen. Droplets of milk can splash into dairy workers’ faces, while milk-splattered equipment and vehicles can transport the virus from cow to cow…. In theory, a virus that spreads through milk should be easier to control than one that floats invisibly in the air. But a look inside the modern dairy industry reveals that milk-based transmission is profoundly worrying. ‘Milk is hugely problematic,’ said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University.” • Detail on how humans and robots milk cows. Commentary: I only know what I read in the papers, so perhaps some kind reader can comment on this solution.

That could finally boost the stock” [MarketWatch]. “Leaders at Boeing Co. have been struggling to turn the company around after years of bad headlines. Now, some investors are hoping they’ll look to a new tactic: selling some of its businesses, which could shore up the company’s balance sheet and lift the stock from its doldrums. There are a few discrete businesses within the aerospace and defense behemoth that could generate cash, including Boeing’s Jeppesen navigation unit and Boeing’s parts distribution business. In conversations with MarketWatch, some investors also have raised the possibility of changes to Boeing’s satellite-launch joint venture with Lockheed Martin Corp.” Manufacturing: “Budget airline Ryanair cuts passenger traffic goal again on Boeing delays” [CNBC]. “[Ryanair CFO Neil Sorahan], who said he recently returned from a trip to Boeing’s production facilities into Seattle, said he’d seen ‘huge improvements in relation to supply chain and everything else’ in recent months. ‘I have a high level of confidence that the remaining nine aircraft that we need to get to 181 ‘Gamechangers’ along with the existing fleet will come in,’ he added. Sorahan said that Boeing appeared to have ‘turned the corner,’ adding that he was hopeful Ryanair would not need to cut its traffic targets even further.” • I hope its true.

People in traditional communities where everyone naps live longer than people in modernized ones where they don’t. The siesta is lifesaving. Walker even conjectures that our peculiar sleep patterns may explain our evolutionary advance. We sleep less than other primates, but get relatively more REM sleep, and the dreams it brings, than our monkey and ape cousins. It is during REM sleep, Walker insists, that we engage in ’emotional processing.’ The mnemonic collisions during this phase forge new connections among our experiences, and we wake not merely refreshed but revived and enlightened by our re-wrought neural networks.” • Hmm. * * * Contact information for plants: Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, to (a) find out how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal and (b) to find out how to send me images of plants.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Great links today. Thanks. > Great links today. Thanks. Well, thank you! Love the Hopper painting as well “Rooms for Tourists.” Found this- ‘Edward Hopper’s paintings of buildings are portraits, in which the human presence is implied but not seen. In Rooms for Tourists, Hopper portrays the exterior of a boarding house in Provincetown, Massachusetts. He made study drawings of the building and then traveled there repeatedly at night while he worked on the painting. The contrast between the warm, electrically lit interior and the darkness of night outside captures the sense of transience and impermanence inherent in the boarding house’s impersonal arrivals and departures.’ https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/52638 “Sir, a second open source AI model from DeepSeek has been revealed” https://www.reuters.com/technology/deepseeks-janus-pro-ai-model-beats-rivals-image-generation-2025-01-27/ > “Sir, a second open source AI model from DeepSeek has been revealed” We need a Sam Altman Downfall parody, for sure.

Moon of Alabama wrote this development up. The Raspberry Pi’s are now sold out. Deepseek software is free and will run on this device. This deserves some recognition. Please stop amplifying nonsense. Deepseek’s frontier model R1 is 671 billion parameters. Model parameters are directly correlated with compute requirements and quality of output. 671 billion parameter model won’t run on a powerful desktop computer, let alone a Raspberry Pi. Even with their optimization tricks, it still has to compute 32 billion parameters. What they were running on pi is a tiny model with terrible output quality. All tiny models (and I have played with many) are toys, and their outputs are completely unreliable. Smaller 7 billion parameter models do run on desktop computers already, including small Llama, Mistral, Gemma etc. models with a 6 core Ryzen CPU running it are an intolerable 20-30 tokens per second. To give you a reference of that speed, the model would output the length of your comment in about 5 seconds. Tiny models with 1 billion parameters run on Rasberry pi’s, and DeepSeek’s tiny-model is not the first one to do so. There are AI video tools that could do this, put his face on Hitler. Could they capture his uber-PMC mannerisms? We need a new classification to describe half-built, abandoned data centers, now that DeepSeek has moved our tech oligarchs cheese. Busted bunkers? Rebar-wrecks? I am sure Wukchumni will have a nice suggestion. Maybe make nightclubs from the wreckage? This Los Angeles Stock Exchange building opened in 1931 and the company merged into the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange in 1956. It was incorporated as the Pacific Stock Exchange in 1973.It was the largest regional stock exchange west of the Mississippi. In 1986, the exchange moved to another site. By the end of the decade, the Stock Exchange, a nightclub, opened in the renovated building. All-night raves in the site of an abandoned rebar-wreck … I like it! With all that physical security built in (6-foot thick walls, security cameras, fences) it will keep the cops out, too. Bomb shelters probably made good speakeasies, back in the day. If they can pull it off, panic at the disco shifting nicely to panacea at the datacenter Indoor bull rings? Go all Elizabethan and include Bear Rings too! Here’s a Ryan Grim post explaining the current DeepSeek invasion and a shout out to Lisa Kahn: “U.S. tech stocks are plummeting as China looks to be exposing American companies involved in AI as wildly overvalued. It’s a predictable consequence of how the American government has approached Silicon Valley and vice versa. This isn’t the kind of thing we normally cover, but we don’t quite trust the U.S. media to tell this story accurately.” https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/deepseek-openai-lina-khan-sam-altman Very good timeline development and technology explanation. Thanks. Our Tech Lords tried to grease the skids for their fraudulent business models that relied on massive amounts of confetti money as a barrier to entry. DeepSeek deep sixes greased AI. Film at Eleven! Very good article that. It seems that DeepSeek just did an Oreshnik on OpenAI’s burgeoning financial structure. Time to pivot back to crypto! Or the metaverse. The bubble must not deflate! And don’t tell me DeepSeek can mine cryptocurrency at the same time it’s answering questions from the plebes. We might as well give up and welcome our new Chinese overlords if that’s the case. > We need a new classification to describe half-built, abandoned data centers AI-mandias? I met a traveller from an antique land Who said: Two thousand vast and trunkless boxes of stone Stand in the desert. Near them, on the wires, Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown, And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed: And on the pedestal these words appear: “My name is Altman, King of Kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” No thing beside remains.

We can call it the “Jacob’s Ladder Data Centre.” Stay safe down there in the icy wastes of N’Awleenz. Democrats doing lawfare is also an admission that the current system services liberal Democrat purposes just fine, Their Democracy, and they don’t have any particular interests in making any changes that might provide material benefits. Kind of mind-bending that we went from the Biggest Threat Ever to Trump is a president to be opposed by gentle lawfare efforts. Wat? Anyone can do lawfare. Part of the Civil Rights Revolution was conducted through the Courts, and that was lawfare. Lawfare was one weapons system and demonstrations/marches/Freedom Rides/etc. was another weapons system and political organizing/registering to vote/voting was another weapons system. Damage suits against the oil companies are lawfare. If lawfare is the only weapons system you have, you use that or you use nothing at all. So the question becomes, who is using lawfare against whom, and in service to what? Democracy 2025. Lambert comments: “So, doubling down on lawfare. 350 organizations is not a sign of strength. It’s a sign of weakness. Nor are these NGOs representative of “civil society” as a whole.” But Lambert, they’re FIGHTING for us. Surely that’s all we need to know, isn’t it? Isn’t it? re: “they’re FIGHTING for us”.(tm) Please send money. / ;) > But Lambert, they’re FIGHTING for us. Surely [bangs head on desk] These lawfare Democrat should count themselves extremely lucky that nobody seems to give a [family blog] about that genocide they’ve all been facilitating. Last I checked murdering tens of thousands of women and children was frowned upon by the law… FIGHTING to get us ACCESS! Gotta keep their powder dry for the Political DDAY! The democrat list for 2025 looks like they want a president Vance. Also just read a Tweet from team D that Orange Hitler has spent 30% of his presidency playing golf. Giggle. So he has done so much his first week they can’t get a grip on what to be outraged about, yet he spent too much time playing golf. Crazy times we live in. Did they factor in the time spent on that Colombia President mulligan? ;) It really is not a good look at all for AOC, et al. All over twitter yesterday about how expensive coffee and cut flowers were going to be very soon. That was their priority. Meanwhile, and so far, all the attention rounding up these illegals seems to be on the criminals, etc. I would make a rational assumption that the planes to Colombia are pretty much those kind of immigrants. In other words, exactly who needs to be sent home. And by so doing – protecting the kids and families of America who should not be forced to live next to pimps, drug runners and criminals. My patient family today who brought in their grandma were just effusively singing the praises of Donald Trump. “He understood these bad people need to go home” and “he cares about our safety”. etc. Ummm, AOC – the coffee and flowers routine is not working on these people. Of course coffee and daily Starbucks hits are much more important issues to your constituency. It will be really entertaining when it is Mexico’s turn….Oh me oh my, what are we ever going to do without our avocado toast? Better luck next time. Not to mention is the entire flower issue is predicated on the fact that the entire industry was moved to Colombia by NAFTA neoliberals, leaving all of those American workers behind to learn how to code and leaving boarded up greenhouses – STILL THERE – saw it this summer – in their wake. The other thought going through my head last night…….There must be a couple hundred very bad people on that plane that the President of Colombia would risk a trade war to keep them out. This is going to be a very interesting four years. This is going to be a very long four years for the AOC crowd if this absolutely pitiful response is going to be the best they can do. One thing that the “rights people” do that’s offensive to those whom they think they are currying favor with is that they go out of way defending various dubious people who happen to be members of a certain group, as if they are being persecuted because they belong to that group, while ignoring the bit about their being dubious (e.g. criminals etc.) They feed the preconception (which, perhaps, they themelves hold, that members of that group are predisposed to criminality, say (and, worse, “can’t help themselves,” because of culture or whatever.) In other words, attempts at playing “culturism” winds up being pretty much a perpetuation of racism (possibly, that, their own racism.) Having been on the other end often enough (allegedly positive “model minority” stereotypes and variations of thinly disguised “yellow peril” ones), I’ve found this tendency profoundly offensive a bit too often. This makes a deal of sense. The NGOs claiming to rescue the victims must insist the victims are always and immutably victims. There is no out or up or escape into better lives for the victims, only the ministrations of the NGOs can make the victims lives better, the NGOs may claim. The NGOs may do good work at one level but terrible blocking at another level. I am amazed that people, especially intelligent people who should know better, eat up the propaganda stunt of the denied deportation flight. Look at how I’m going to stare down the government of any country on earth: 1. arrange a flight that doesn’t follow normal protocols (shackling deportees), using military planes (do you want other countries to fly their military planes into the US without getting permission first??) 2. say nasty things when flight gets rejected 3. arrange a more normal flight the next day 4. declare victory when it gets accepted Also, if he’s really going to do mass deportations, where is he going to get all the planes? Why isn’t anyone talking about ships yet? (Hint: he’s not really serious about the mass deportations.) They say their target is 1200-1500 people per day. That is at most less that 2.2 million people over Trump’s entire term. My understanding is that 2 million illegal migrants came every year during Biden’s term. So they’d need to increase the rate four-fold to return the number of illegal migrants at the end of Trump’s first term. There were supposedly 12 million illegal migrants in the US at the end of Trump’s first term, and if an additional 8 million arrived, there would be 20 million of them. That would mean each one has a 1/10=10% chance of being deported. Immigration crackdowns, deportations [▲]; I don’t see why we should expect that to cause inflation, particularly if those who are deported have been convicted of engaging in activities that reduce productivity (crimes such as theft, procuring drugs, making places unsafe, etc). It’s not as if Biden’s term, during which the number of illegal migrants increased by 8 million, is known for reducing inflation. All over twitter yesterday about how expensive coffee and cut flowers were going to be very soon. That was their priority. I guess the one million homeless Americans, the threats to the food supply, not to mention the price of it, and various other things are not important? If I couldn’t afford coffee, I would just buy tea, as much as I have started with coffee most every morning for forty years. Really, the arguments from the Democratic Party and its supporters are getting more unserious by the day. very good IM DOC, lets remind all what NAFTA stands for, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement North American Free Trade Agreement it was sold to us by neo-liberal weasels in the economic professions, politicians, media shills as free trade, because it is free trade for a few. now they say there is no such thing as free trade, after its imploded. under free trade, government no longer has sovereignty and democratic control. government is now subservient to capital, they now are the enforcers of free trade for capital. https://fpif.org/free-trade-regime-oligarchy-action/ “Let’s put this assertion to the test by looking at the concrete example of free trade agreements and their relation to democracy and national sovereignty. “Democracy” typically refers to a system of government in which people decide on the rules of their sovereign nation. In the true spirit of democracy and sovereignty, all spheres of policy — including the environment, trade, finance, intellectual property, and culture — must be subject to a fair political process and self-determination. In the modern, globalized world, the institutions of democracy and sovereignty exist in tension with another powerful institution: the global market and its free trade regimes.” “While a small number of labor unions and NGOs appear to have some involvement in the process, critics note that many relevant actors have been shut out. As renowned economists Joseph Stiglitz and Dean Baker contend, it is mostly the executive branch and some privileged big corporations that are involved in the process, and are therefore able to shape the treaty to fit their narrow interests.” Pretty sure we’ll have winged piglet passenger service between Davenport and Muscatine before any of those 12 losers get elected President.

People who nap in my culture are considers sick or strange. But our nights in the winter are so long that we sleep longer at night in the winter and less in the summer. Maybe it is not so much the the siesta is good for all of us, but good for those living in lower latitudes. Or maybe we are all so disconnected from nature that we cannot even feel the natural rhythms anymore, and maybe those with insomnia are just much more sensitive. If you are interested, here are some historical photographs of the Sami. REM sleep, the hard way. Prostate brachytherapy, with multiple waking periods per night.

The idea of a straight through eight hour sleep is relatively new apparently.

It was our move into an industrial society that broke this sleep pattern- https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/sleeping-through-the-night-is-a-relatively-new-invention.html Time was, not even so very long ago, relatively speaking, when hominins had to get up to tend the fire.

Good data as usual. New Patrick Lawrence takes a glass half full look at the Trump liftoff and even ventures some explanations. Many of the big-name philosophers of the past 100 years — Husserl, Heidegger, Lévinas, et al. — shared a pronounced preoccupation beginning in the 1920s. I relate this (and the scholars may correct me) to the wreckage of the First World War they found all around them. These were the explorers and developers of the discipline called phenomenology. Who are we? What has become of us, we who dwell in mass, mechanized societies? What is the nature of human relationships? These were among the questions. Emmanuel Lévinas, a Lithuanian Jew who lived in France (1906–1995) and wrote in French, elevated these matters to an enduring discourse concerning the Self and the Other. Indifference to others, he argued — and how radically must I simplify — lay at the root of the 20th century’s ills and evils. The cult of the individual, he posited (among a lot of other things) must be transcended in favor of relationships with all the Others among us. We realize who we are only by way of these relationships; they are primary. “The Self is possible only through the recognition of the Other,” he wrote, a noted line. So, to continue my simplification: We are social beings first; our individuality derives from our sociality. Lévinas published Totality and Infinity, the book wherein he stated his case most fully and famously, in 1961. […] Americans are not well-advantaged in these matters, to put the point mildly. We long ago turned our insistence in our individuality into the “ism” of individualism, an ideology that, however far it has taken America in the past, now proves a ball and chain at our ankles. Equally, America has had such power since the 1945 victories that its policy cliques long ago lost interest in the perspectives of others—how the world looks to them, their aspirations, their histories, all the rest. This is why, with admirable but few exceptions, America produces such poor diplomats. It has had no need of them. And the policy cliques in Washington have not yet registered that we have in consequence already begun to fail. https://scheerpost.com/2025/01/27/patrick-lawrence-trumps-failures-americas-failures/ He’s saying the American cult of individualism also accounts for Trump’s pronouncements about the countries he wants to take over or the map points to be renamed. It’s a bit of megalomania to be sure but also the provincialism of someone who doesn’t worry much about how others might see these ideas. And for that reason he’s saying it’s very unlikely that most of them will come to pass including, one hopes, his recent statements about the Middle East. By contrast the Bidenistas’ fantasies were serious as a heart attack. One might well claim that in that instance the America above all others view morphed into sociopathy. Thanks for your comment. One argument I’ve read about T touting a north-south US empire vs an east-west empire is that the neocon dream of an east-west empire has hit a stopping point. Whereas, in comparison, a north-south empire can still be achieved in some fashion, and would also undercut the neocon east-west dreams, if one wanted to undercut the neocon dreams. Not a bad argument, imo. Reminds me of Cheneys quip about creating their own reality and everyone else just having to go with it. ” Thinking ChatGPT is useless is midwit” . . . is midwit.

I really hope this isn’t “we’re out of strategies, just do lawfare all over again!” like the first term was. If so, we are in for a long four years. > is.

ATW Livestream Tonight at 8 PM ET/7 PM CT https://www.racket.news/p/atw-livestream-tonight-at-8-pm-et7-1a5 I’ve been watching Tucker Carlson’s lengthy interview with Matt. Good to see Matt in that platform, though sad to see him pushing the idea that masks were unnecessary and their use was instituted as a way of “inducing social conformity”. He seems to be a big Battacharya fan. Matt did say that inducing social conformity might well have been a motive and, as I understood it, after the fact. I do not recall him saying masks were per se unnecessary. Yes, sad indeed, much as I enjoy Matt’s commentary on many things. He falls into a special category of writers who are usually so spot on, that when they go off into the deep end it is so absurdly wacky and obvious that I’m prepared to cut him more slack that I would for someone of lesser talents. And yet, do we throw out the baby with the bath water? Or do we do our own research (horrors!) and come to our own conclusions? Taking Taibbi and many others into account? The US’s ye olde health authorities having fallen into disrepute, I’ll read widely and come to my own conclusions. Gasp! From How the Messy Process of Milking Cows Can Spread Bird Flu It takes seven hours for the farm to milk all 1,050 cows. Then, the workers spend an hour cleaning, which includes washing out the milking equipment with detergent and hot water. After that, the next eight-hour shift begins, and all the cows are milked again. It’s hard to believe this doesn’t milk the cows to death. Like a war, this runs 24/7. My family’s dairy farm used to milk the cows twice per day, about 10-11 hours apart, so the schedule from the link isn’t that drastic. Also, dairy cows are “dried off” (not milked at all) for several weeks per year. I’m sure though that your average cow in an industrial herd has a shorter lifespan than one on a small farm that sends most of her day out in the field. That sounds right and on an industrial milk factory as described it would take hours to clean the equipment. If the cows are milked in the same order the milkings would be 10 to 11, maybe 12 hours apart. re: Gallery Wonderful and hilarious Chas Addams cartoon to think most readers identified with and got a laugh from the Addams Family cartoons.

I came to the conclusion that Japan is governed by customs, unlike the US which is governed by laws. Yet, if we denigrate both norms and lawsuits, what recourse remains? Heraclitus (fragment 249): “The people must fight on behalf of the law as though for the city wall.” Abraham Lincoln (in “The Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions.”): “As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor…. Let reverence for the laws…become the political religion of the nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars.” Law is the ultimate propaganda. I think not in the US. Else why would Davos fellow the American John Kerry claim the US Constitution’s !st Amendment regarding freedom of speech a difficultly and an impediment for “their right to rule”? Where said “their right” is an entirely undemocratic and shadowy body? Japan has extremely well-shared and well-enforced norms, something absent in the US. So less friction. Hence the recourse in the US to lawsuits (or as some would have it, to lawfare). Property, liberty, and wardship compose authority, first in the solitary individual, then in the family, and finally in the state. (At the state level, wardship consists of all laws, magistracies, judiciary, arms, fortifications, wars, and treaties.) Civil authority, comprised of all three, is political sovereignty, but from what shall this authority derive its justification? Authority is related to certitude as reason is related to truth. Truth is the object of divine reason–Only god knows the Truth; certitude is all that belongs to man. This certitude depends not on reason but on authority–the authority of our senses or of our informants or of those who have enacted the laws which we receive as determinant or certain. Certitude is a partial knowledge. Certitude is subjective. Certitude is empirical, dependent on experience or tradition, and not on reason. Hence, progress in history and politics consists in the gradual assimilation of authority to reason. In theory, anyway. The true ‘Red Flag’ in that Resume Now list is the fact that 3 in 10 report having taken out debt to pay living expenses. The more immiserated people become, the more desperate they become, the more angry they become. We are thus seeing first-hand the creation of a revolutionary mass. As people become increasingly “homeless,” Power truly will be out in the street waiting to be picked up. What the American Democrat Party needs now is an American Lenin to force them into action. Re: “Scoop: How Trump’s ‘black box’ limits outside influences” “It’s a total black box,” a lobbyist close to the administration told Axios. “Nothing is leaking except what they want.” There’s a “strong silo system” that has kept advocates and special interests from forum-shopping and end-running administration officials, the lobbyist added. So… “forum-shopping and end-running administration officials” means either the way things worked in the Trump 1.0 admin, or else it means this has just been the standard operating procedure for DC lobbyists under any recent admin (given time, tho, I’m sure the lobbyists will figure it out).

Title: Chinese AI Startup DeepSeek Shakes up Silicon Valley, Wall Street
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/chinese-ai-startup-deepseek-shakes-up-silicon-valley-wall-street/

Shares of Nvidia, the darling stock of the generative AI boom, are down 15.3% in midday trading on Monday (Jan. 27) as Wall Street grapples with the revelation that it could be overpaying for this emerging technology. Google, Microsoft and Amazon shares are also down. The culprit: Chinese AI startup DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence (AI) models that perform on par with OpenAI’s and Google’s top models but at a fraction of the cost and with far fewer of Nvidia’s GPUs. DeepSeek was founded by Liang Wenfeng, who also co-founded a quantitative hedge fund in China called High-Flyer. DeepSeek has released a family of models: V3 (AI chat) and R1 (reasoning models). The startup said R1 had cost $5.58 million and used 2,048 of Nvidia’s H800 chips to train, according to a paper published by its researchers. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said that AI models currently cost $100 million to train, but it could hit $100 billion. AI executives have also said training would need thousands of AI chips, principally those made by Nvidia. The sell-off comes as OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX announced a project called Stargate last week that plans to spend $100 billion to half a trillion dollars to build AI infrastructure, mainly data centers. Those and other AI cost estimates are now in question. Shares of Microsoft were down 3.7%, Google fell 3% and Amazon gave up about 1%. “Artificial intelligence has reached a critical inflection point. The industry stands at a crossroads where escalating costs, environmental concerns, and innovation appear intertwined, threatening to stifle accessibility and adoption,” Gokul Naidu, a consultant for SAP, told PYMNTS. “Enter DeepSeek-R1, the model that’s turning heads in Silicon Valley and beyond for proving that high performance and affordability aren’t mutually exclusive.” “DeepSeek challenges the narrative that innovation must come at an unsustainable cost,” Naidu said. “For businesses, this means AI could soon be accessible to small and medium enterprises, not just tech giants with deep pockets.” DeepSeek could “catalyze a shift in Silicon Valley’s approach to AI,” Naidu said. “Historically, the tech epicenter has prioritized growth at all costs, often ignoring questions of efficiency. But DeepSeek forces a recalibration. With its dramatically lower cost structure, businesses and developers alike are reevaluating their priorities, focusing on efficiency-driven growth.” DeepSeek is now the most downloaded app in the Apple App Store. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pushed back in a post on X last month, when DeepSeek V3 first came out, saying, “It is (relatively) easy to copy something that you know works. it is extremely hard to do something new, risky, and difficult when you don’t know if it will work. individual researchers rightly get a lot of glory for that when they do it! it’s the coolest thing in the world.” DeepSeek also reportedly is subject to Chinese censorship, refusing to answer questions about Taiwan, for example. (Developers can get around this by revising the open-source models.) Marc Andreessen, from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, posted on X that “DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world.” Naidu said DeepSeek’s open-source strategy “further amplifies its impact. OpenAI’s proprietary approach, while effective, limits transparency and collaboration. By contrast, DeepSeek invites developers worldwide to contribute, experiment, and build on its platform. This open-source ethos democratizes AI capabilities, fostering a more inclusive innovative ecosystem.” Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun said in a post on LinkedIn that people concerned that China is overtaking the U.S. in AI are misreading DeepSeek’s impact. “The correct reading is: Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones. DeepSeek has profited from open research and open source. … They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people’s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it. That is the power of open research and open source.” Meta, whose strategy was to distribute open-source AI models, saw its shares up 1%. With open source, any developer can download and fine-tune, or retrain to customize, their AI models. However, developers typically still have to pay fees to access the model through APIs. While Meta doesn’t charge to access its API, DeepSeek does. But Naidu said DeepSeek is also deeply discounted here: “DeepSeek charges $0.55 per million tokens, compared to OpenAI’s o1 model, which demands $15 per million tokens. For businesses wary of runaway operational bills, this is a game-changer.” Many developers build their own AI applications atop the foundation models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and others. To access and use these models, such as inputting prompts and getting responses, developers have to pay AI pricing based on token volume. (A thousand tokens translates to roughly 750 words.) Naidu also pointed out that DeepSeek was also able to get around President Joe Biden’s export controls on advanced AI chips, which he recently expanded to carve out different levels of access for more than 120 countries. “DeepSeek’s achievement is particularly impressive given its constraints,” Naidu said. “As a Chinese company facing export restrictions, it was unable to access the latest Nvidia GPUs, such as the H200, and instead relied on older H800 GPUs. Yet, the R1 model still managed to rival — or, in some tests, outperform — more expensive counterparts.” “This feat speaks volumes about the ingenuity behind DeepSeek’s approach. It’s not just about throwing money at the problem; it’s about finding smarter, leaner ways to train and deploy AI systems,” Naidu added. Naidu cited the following ripple effects from DeepSeek: “DeepSeek is more than a model — it’s a wake-up call for the entire AI industry,” Naidu said. “It challenges entrenched assumptions about the cost of innovation and offers a path forward where cutting-edge technology is both affordable and sustainable. As we move deeper into 2025, the conversation around AI is no longer just about power — it’s about power at the right price. “And in this race, DeepSeek might just have redefined the finish line.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: What to Know About DeepSeek, the Chinese AI Company Causing Stock Market Chaos

Time Published: 2025-01-27T18:55:12Z

A new Chinese AI model, created by the Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek, has stunned the American AI industry by outperforming some of OpenAI’s leading models, displacing ChatGPT at the top of the iOS app store, and usurping Meta as the leading purveyor of so-called open source AI tools. All of which has raised a critical question: despite American sanctions on Beijing’s ability to access advanced semiconductors, is China catching up with the U.S. in the global AI race? At a supposed cost of just $6 million to train, DeepSeek’s new R1 model, released last week, was able to match the performance on several math and reasoning metrics by OpenAI’s o1 model – the outcome of tens of billions of dollars in investment by OpenAI and its patron Microsoft. The Chinese model is also cheaper for users. Access to its most powerful versions costs some 95% less than OpenAI and its competitors. The upshot: the U.S. tech industry is suddenly faced with a potentially cheaper and more powerful challenger, unnerving investors, who sold off American tech stocks on Monday morning. Yet not everyone is convinced. Some American AI researchers have cast doubt on DeepSeek’s claims about how much it spent, and how many advanced chips it deployed to create its model. Few, however, dispute DeepSeek’s stunning capabilities. “Deepseek R1 is AI's Sputnik moment,” wrote prominent American venture capitalist Marc Andreessen on X, referring to the moment in the Cold War when the Soviet Union managed to put a satellite in orbit ahead of the United States. So, what is DeepSeek and what could it mean for U.S. tech supremacy? DeepSeek was founded less than two years ago by the Chinese hedge fund High Flyer as a research lab dedicated to pursuing Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI. A spate of open source releases in late 2024 put the startup on the map, including the large language model “v3”, which outperformed all of Meta's open-source LLMs and rivaled OpenAI's closed-source GPT4-o. At the time, Liang Wenfeng, the CEO, reportedly said that he had hired young computer science researchers with a pitch to “solve the hardest questions in the world"—critically, without aiming for profits. Early signs were promising: his products were so efficient that DeepSeek’s 2024 releases sparked a price war within the Chinese AI industry, forcing competitors to slash prices. This year, that price war looks set to reach across the Pacific Ocean. Yet DeepSeek’s AI looks different from its U.S. competitors in one important way. Despite their high performance on reasoning tests, Deepseek’s models are constrained by China’s restrictive policies regarding criticism of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). DeepSeek R1 refuses to answer questions about the massacre at Tiananmen Square, Beijing, in 1989, for example. “Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else,” the model said when queried by TIME. At a moment when Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and dozens of their competitors are preparing to spend further tens of billions of dollars on new AI infrastructure, DeepSeek’s success has raised a troubling question: Could Chinese tech firms potentially match, or even surpass, their technical prowess while spending significantly less? Meta, which plans to spend $65 billion on AI infrastructure this year, has already set up four “war rooms” to analyze DeepSeek’s models, seeking to find out how the Chinese firm had managed to train a model so cheaply and use the insights to improve its own open source Llama models, tech news site The Information reported over the weekend. In the financial markets, Nvidia’s stock price dipped more than 15% on Monday morning on fears that fewer AI chips may be necessary to train powerful AI than previously thought. Other American tech stocks were also trading lower. “While [DeepSeek R1] is good news for users and the global economy, it is bad news for U.S. tech stocks,” says Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. “It may result in a nominal downsizing of capital investment in AI and pressure on margins, at a time when valuation and growth expectations are very stretched.” But American tech hasn’t lost—at least not yet. For now, OpenAI’s “o1 Pro” model is still considered the most advanced in the world. The performance of DeepSeek R1, however, does suggest that China is much closer to the frontier of AI than previously thought, and that open-source models have just about caught up to their closed-source counterparts. Perhaps even more worrying for companies like OpenAI and Google, whose models are closed source, is how much—or rather, how little—DeepSeek is charging consumers to access its most advanced models. OpenAI charges $60 per million “tokens”, or segments of words, outputted by its most advanced model, o1. By contrast DeepSeek charges $2.19 for the same number of tokens from R1—nearly 30 times less. “It erodes the industrial base, it erodes the margin, it erodes the incentive for further capital investment into western [AI] scaling from private sources,” says Edouard Harris, the chief technology officer of Gladstone AI, an AI firm that works closely with the U.S. government. DeepSeek’s success was all the more explosive because it seemed to call into question the effectiveness of the U.S. government’s strategy to constrain China’s AI ecosystem by restricting the export of powerful chips, or GPUs, to Beijing. If DeepSeek’s claims are accurate, it means China has the ability to create powerful AI models despite those restrictions, underlining the limits of the U.S. strategy. DeepSeek has claimed it is constrained by access to chips, not cash or talent, saying it trained its models v3 and R1 using just 2,000 second-tier Nvidia chips. “Money has never been the problem for us,” DeepSeek’s CEO, Liang Wenfeng, said in 2024. “Bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.” (Current U.S. policy makes it illegal to export to China the most advanced types of AI chips, the likes of which populate U.S. datacenters used by OpenAI and Microsoft.) But are those claims true? “My understanding is DeepSeek has 50,000 H100s,” Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang recently told CNBC in Davos, referring to the highest-powered Nvidia GPU chips currently on the market. “They can’t talk about [them], because it is against the export controls that the U.S. has put in place.” (An H100 cluster of that size would cost in the region of billions of dollars.) In a sign of how seriously the CCP is taking the technology, Liang, Deepseek’s CEO, met with China’s premier Li Qiang in Beijing last Monday. In that meeting, Liang reportedly told Li that DeepSeek needs more chips. “DeepSeek only has access to a few thousand GPUs, and yet they’re pulling this off,” says Jeremie Harris, CEO of Gladstone AI. “So this raises the obvious question: what happens when they get an allocation from the Chinese Communist Party to proceed at full speed?” Even though China might have achieved a startling level of AI capability with fewer chips, experts say more computing power will always remain a strategic advantage. On that front, the U.S. remains far ahead. “It's never a bad thing to have more of it,” says Dean Ball, a research fellow at George Mason University. “No matter how much you have of it, you will always use it.” The short answer: from Washington’s perspective, in uncertain waters. In the closing days of the Biden Administration, outgoing National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned that the speed of AI advancement was “the most consequential thing happening in the world right now.” And just days into his new job, President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture, backed by OpenAI and others, to build the infrastructure vital for the creation of “artificial general intelligence”— the next leap forward in AI, with systems advanced enough to make new scientific breakthroughs and reason in ways that have so far remained in the realm of science fiction. Read More: What to Know About ‘Stargate,’ OpenAI’s New Venture Announced by President Trump And although questions remain about the future of U.S. chip restrictions on China, Washington’s priorities were apparent in President Trump’s AI executive order, also signed during his first week in office, which declared that “it is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.” Maintaining this dominance will mean, at least in part, understanding exactly what Chinese tech firms are doing—as well as protecting U.S. intellectual property, experts say. “There's a good chance that DeepSeek and many of the other big Chinese companies are being supported by the [Chinese] government, in more than just a monetary way,” says Edouard Harris of Gladstone AI, who also recommended that U.S. AI companies harden their security measures. Since December, OpenAI’s new o1 and o3 models have smashed records on advanced reasoning tests designed to be difficult for AI models to pass. Read More: AI Models Are Getting Smarter. New Tests Are Racing to Catch Up DeepSeek R1 does something similar, and in the process exemplifies what many researchers say is a paradigm shift: instead of scaling the amount of computing power used to train the model, researchers scale the amount of time (and thus, computing power and electricity) the model uses to think about a response to a query before answering. It is this scaling of what researchers call “test-time compute” that distinguishes the new class of “reasoning models,” such as DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI’s o1, from their less sophisticated predecessors. Many AI researchers believe there’s plenty of headroom left before this paradigm hits its limit. Some AI researchers hailed DeepSeek’s R1 as a breakthrough on the same level as DeepMind’s AlphaZero, a 2017 model that became superhuman at the board games Chess and Go by purely playing against itself and improving, rather than observing any human games. That’s because R1 wasn’t “pretrained” on human-labeled data in the same way as other leading LLMs. Instead, DeepSeek’s researchers found a way to allow the model to bootstrap its own reasoning capabilities essentially from scratch. “Rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies,” they claim. The finding is significant because it suggests that powerful AI capabilities might emerge more rapidly and with less human effort than previously thought, with just the application of more computing power. “DeepSeek R1 is like GPT-1 of this scaling paradigm,” says Ball. Ultimately, China’s recent AI progress, instead of usurping U.S. strength, might in fact be the beginning of a reordering—a step, in other words, toward a future where, instead of a hegemonic power, there are many competing centers of AI power. “China will still have their own superintelligence(s) no more than a year later than the US, absent [for example] a war,” wrote Miles Brundage, a former OpenAI policy staffer, on X. “So unless you want (literal) war, you need to have a vision for navigating multipolar AI outcomes.” Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com

Business Deepseek logo is seen in this illustration taken January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration :Prices of exchange-traded funds with outsize exposure to Nvidia plunged on Monday in reaction to news that a Chinese startup has launched a powerful new artificial intelligence model. Technology market insiders like venture capitalist Marc Andreessen have labeled the emergence of year-old DeepSeek's model a "Sputnik moment" for U.S. AI companies, most of whose share prices slid on news that downloads of DeepSeek already have overtaken those of U.S. rival ChatGPT on Apple's online app store. While Nvidia's share price traded about 17.3 per cent lower by midafternoon on Monday, prices of exchange-traded funds that offer leveraged exposure to the chipmaker plunged still further. The four ETFs that offer daily returns of double the gain in Nvidia were hit with the biggest decline, with the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF nosediving 34.5 per cent. Its leveraged inverse counterpart, which offers investors a gain of double any losses in Nvidia's stock, soared nearly 34 per cent. "These movements were to be expected, given what we saw happen with Nvidia," said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares. "We won't begin to get a sense of how much we're seeing in outflows or inflows until after the market is closed, though." Other leveraged ETFs with large Nvidia exposure made equally dramatic moves. The ProShares Ultra Semiconductors ETF, which targets a return double that of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index and has more than 40 per cent of its assets in Nvidia, tumbled 24.43 per cent by midday on Monday. Those ETF providers could not immediately be reached for comment. "Volatility is what the gamblers in single-stock ETFs are looking for," said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar. "Those that have a bad experience now might shy away in future, but I’m sure they’ll be replaced by others." The leveraged ETFs, which carry relatively high fees of close to 1 per cent compared with about 0.4 per cent for a typical actively managed ETF, are the domain of retail traders and speculators, Armour added. But other ETFs were caught up in the selling, including many owned by institutions and retail investors with a longer investment time horizon. For instance, the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund traded down 5.25 per cent by midafternoon on Monday. Nvidia is the fund's second-largest holding, at nearly 15 per cent of the portfolio. The VistaShares Artificial Intelligence Supercycle ETF lost about 10 per cent by midafternoon. It has a smaller exposure to Nvidia - only 3 per cent - but owns a wide variety of other AI stocks. "Innovation and competition emerging in something as early-stage and dynamic as AI is not that surprising," said Adam Patti, co-founder and CEO of VistaShares. "The market will have to sort itself out over the months and years, as to what works and what will prevail." The rapid growth of AI enthusiasm sent assets in the VistaShares ETF - launched only seven weeks ago - to more than $3 million by Friday, the firm said. The 2x GraniteShares Nvidia ETF - the largest of the leveraged funds - had $5.3 billion in assets as of Friday, according to data from VettaFi, accounting for about half of GraniteShares' total assets. "This has been a little painful, but interesting," said Evan Feagans, who manages the $74 million TCW Artificial Intelligence ETF, which has an 8.5 per cent weighting in Nvidia. "It has been a 'shoot first, ask questions later' kind of response to the DeepSeek news, but I think moves like this create opportunities. I'd expect to hear some of the biggest investors in AI reiterate their AI capital spending outlooks after they report earnings numbers." The selloff follows a week in which investors "aggressively" unloaded holdings in leveraged technology ETFs, said research firm EPFR in its weekly analysis. The firm said these ETFs recorded the second-largest weekly outflow on record, of $1.8 billion, with investors selling $400 million in leveraged Nvidia exposure alone. Data for any outflows from these and other AI-themed ETFs on Monday is not available until Tuesday.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) stands against the other AI stocks. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. AI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank JPMorgan. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Title: The AI-stock wipeout lays bare 2 risks investors have been happy to ignore — until now
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tech-stock-crash-deepseek-magnificent-7-nvidia-outlook-valuation-capex-2025-1

A new artificial intelligence tool from a startup in China has sent shockwaves across the US tech sector, with the cheaper AI model trained on older chips forcing investors to confront two big risks to the market. DeepSeek joined the AI race in recent days, sparking a big sell-off to start the week as investors faced concerns about risks that had largely been glossed over while the bull rally continued for the last two years — namely, risks associated with stretched tech-stock valuations and enormous spending by some of the biggest tech firms as they pursue their AI ambitions. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell sharply Monday morning, down 1.8% and 3.2% around noon ET. Semiconductor stocks faced the steepest losses, while tech giants including Microsoft and Alphabet also dropped. The debut of the DeepSeek AI tool blindsided investors who have been willing to accept the tech sector's historically stretched valuations as justified since the bull market took off in 2022. The new AI app is also likely forcing tough questions about AI spending by the cloud "hyperscalers" that have pursued ambitious AI programs in the last few years. Overnight, it's become much harder to shrug off two big risks to the stock market's dominant narrative. Chatter about a possible correction has risen, but has still mostly been confined to the fringes of Wall Street's consensus views. The market has predicted another strong year for stocks, even after the S&P 500 hit more than 50 records in 2024 and posted a second year of 25% gains. With help from the AI investing frenzy, the Magnificent Seven stocks — Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla — have surged, and account for over a third of the value of the S&P 500. Writing in a note earlier this month, Bank of America analysts said that of the 20 valuation metrics they track, 19 were sitting at extreme levels. The S&P 500's trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 25.3 times, for example, is 70% above its 125-year average of about 15 times. Valuation metrics like that have been easy to accept while the market's biggest stocks faced little outside competition and could woo investors with promises of the transformative power of new technology. But DeepSeek is now laying bare the danger that the US market has been overvalued. As its AI tool undercuts OpenAI on pricing, outperforms leading US peers, and is being trained on older and cheaper Nvidia GPUs, tech valuations are in doubt. That's evident in the plunge in the price of Nvidia stock on Monday. The chip titan, which reclaimed the title of the world's most valuable company from Apple last week, dropped as much as 18% and was headed for a loss that would mark the worst market-cap wipeout in history. Broadcom fell more than 17% and Taiwan Semiconductor Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was down more than 14% at midday. "What makes Monday's tech selloff so jarring is that the valuations of many of these AI and tech companies offer no margin of error," David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at The Bahnsen Group, said in written commentary. "Excessive valuation always becomes a problem, eventually, but fundamental news becomes a heightened problem when it is combined with excessive valuation." The tech meltdown could also lead to a painful reckoning among investors over high spending among the "hyperscalers" — companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms — that have poured billions of dollars into AI to further build out cloud computing capabilities. Morgan Stanley estimated at the end of last year that Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft would collectively see $300 billion in AI capital expenditures through 2025, with even bigger figures to come in 2026. Before that, Bernstein projected that Big Tech capex on data centers and real estate would exceed $1 trillion over five years. Microsoft alone said it would spend $80 billion this year on AI data centers. "These high and rising capex numbers again speak to the importance of continued disclosure about new/incremental adoption, engagement, and revenue opportunities each of the four companies are seeing and investing in," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote last November. Investors had been getting somewhat anxious to start seeing a return on this spending, but have largely still been willing to tolerate it as long as earnings growth continued. Bullish analysts had argued that heavy spending was required to fuel a profitable AI boom over the next decade. However, DeepSeek is challenging this view. For one, the AI tool is trained on cheaper Nvidia H800 chips, as the US government has restricted the sale of some of the company's most advanced GPUs to China. The fact that a cutting-edge AI app has been developed with last-gen tech may damage the thesis that companies need to spend more and more on high-powered GPUs to keep up. This has sparked some discussions about future demand for Nvidia's more expensive hardware. "While there is a contention that DeepSeek's efficient training methods could reduce the demand for high-end Nvidia GPUs, potentially affecting sales, it is also plausible that the more cost-effective approach will result in more demand for hardware for those looking to train proprietary models," wrote Mark Klein, CEO of SuRo Capital. While the market's tech panic has revived dormant issues concerning valuations and spending, Bernstein analysts said on Monday that the reaction may be overblown. Analysts at Jefferies, meanwhile, suggested reduced exposure to semiconductor supply chains while the impact becomes more clear. Investors are also bracing for tech earnings to begin this week, and DeepSeek has raised the stakes for mega-cap results. While strong Big Tech earnings have been a catalyst for fresh gains, DeepSeek could spoil the party this time. "We do not expect big tech earnings over the next two weeks to help justify the sector's elevated valuations. These companies may very well report a wonderful quarter, and they may guide higher for intended orders and revenue expectations. Current valuations do not factor in the risks of competition, which seems inevitable, and risks of diminished order books in the future, and all the other reasons that lofty valuations eventually revert to the mean," he wrote. Importantly, the broader stock market's fate in 2025 might hinge on the performance of the Magnificent Seven. At the end of last year, Bank of America said that the elite group must keep winning to avoid spurring a wider market correction. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and a slew of other stocks related to AI sold off Monday as an app from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek boomed in popularity. DeepSeek's AI assistant recently topped the list of free iPhone apps on Apple's (AAPL) app store. (It wasn't in the top 10 on Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store, though it is listed there.) In Apple's store, the app ranked higher than ChatGPT; not so on Google. Here’s what you need to know about DeepSeek—and why it’s having a big impact on markets. And if you're wondering if it wasn't that long ago that another Chinese app was topping the download charts, you're not wrong. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China, the tech hub home to Alibaba (BABA) and many of China’s other high-flying tech giants. The company says its latest R1 AI model released last week offers performance that is on par with that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Its V3 base model launched in December was also reportedly developed in just two months for under $6 million, at a time when the U.S. is limiting China's access to its most sophisticated chips and American AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms (META) are spending billions of dollars on development. The rapid ascension of DeepSeek has investors worried it could threaten assumptions about how much competitive AI models cost to develop, as well as the kind of infrastructure needed to support them, with wide-reaching implications for the AI marketplace and Big Tech shares. Nvidia in a statement called DeepSeek "an excellent AI advancement," calling it a "perfect example" of a concept known as test time scaling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% Monday as investors dragged a host of stocks with ties to AI, from chip to energy firms, downwards. Shares of American AI chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) sold off, along with those of international partners like TSMC (TSM). The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 9%. Networking solutions and hardware partner stocks dropped along with them, including Dell (Dell), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Arista Networks (ANET). Some energy stocks were hit too. Shares of nuclear and other energy companies that saw their stocks boom in the last year in anticipation of an AI-driven boom in energy demand, such as Vistra (VST), Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale (SMR), also lost ground Monday. Meanwhile, some non-tech sectors like consumer staples rose Monday, marking a reconsideration of the market's momentum in recent months. Several analysts raised doubts about the longevity of the market’s reaction Monday, suggesting that the day's pullback could offer investors a chance to pick up AI names set for a rebound. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon called the reaction “overblown” and maintained an “outperform” rating for Nvidia’s stock price. Citi analysts, who said they expect AI companies to continue buying its advanced chips, maintained a "buy" rating on Nvidia. Wedbush analysts, who voiced skepticism that any major U.S. companies would use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to build their AI infrastructure, said “launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Wedbush called Monday a “golden buying opportunity” to own shares in ChatGPT backer Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem that had come under pressure.

The rapid ascension of DeepSeek has investors worried it could threaten assumptions about how much competitive AI models cost to develop, as well as the kind of infrastructure needed to support them, with wide-reaching implications for the AI marketplace and Big Tech shares. Nvidia in a statement called DeepSeek "an excellent AI advancement," calling it a "perfect example" of a concept known as test time scaling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% Monday as investors dragged a host of stocks with ties to AI, from chip to energy firms, downwards. Shares of American AI chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) sold off, along with those of international partners like TSMC (TSM). The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 9%. Networking solutions and hardware partner stocks dropped along with them, including Dell (Dell), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Arista Networks (ANET). Some energy stocks were hit too. Shares of nuclear and other energy companies that saw their stocks boom in the last year in anticipation of an AI-driven boom in energy demand, such as Vistra (VST), Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale (SMR), also lost ground Monday. Meanwhile, some non-tech sectors like consumer staples rose Monday, marking a reconsideration of the market's momentum in recent months. Several analysts raised doubts about the longevity of the market’s reaction Monday, suggesting that the day's pullback could offer investors a chance to pick up AI names set for a rebound. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon called the reaction “overblown” and maintained an “outperform” rating for Nvidia’s stock price. Citi analysts, who said they expect AI companies to continue buying its advanced chips, maintained a "buy" rating on Nvidia. Wedbush analysts, who voiced skepticism that any major U.S. companies would use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to build their AI infrastructure, said “launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Wedbush called Monday a “golden buying opportunity” to own shares in ChatGPT backer Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem that had come under pressure.

Title: DeepSeek's cheaper models and weaker chips call into question trillions in AI infrastructure spending

The bombshell that is China's DeepSeek model has set the AI ecosystem alight. The models are high-performing, relatively cheap, and compute-efficient, which has led many to posit that they pose an existential threat to American companies like OpenAI and Meta — and the trillions of dollars going into building, improving, and scaling US AI infrastructure. The price of DeepSeek's open-source model is competitive — 20 to 40 times cheaper to run than comparable models from OpenAI, Bernstein analysts said. But the potentially more nerve-racking element in the DeepSeek equation for US-built models is the relatively modest hardware stack used to build them. The DeepSeek-V3 model, which is most comparable to OpenAI's ChatGPT, was trained on a cluster of 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs, according to the technical report published by the company. H800s are the first version of the company's defeatured chip for the Chinese market. After the regulations were amended, the company made another defeatured chip, the H20 to comply with the changes. Though this may not always be the case, chips are the most substantial cost in the large language model training equation. Being forced to use less powerful, cheaper chips created a constraint that the DeepSeek team has ostensibly overcome. "Innovation under constraints takes genius," Sri Ambati, the CEO of the open-source AI platform H2O.ai, told Business Insider. Even on subpar hardware, training DeepSeek-V3 took less than two months, the company's report said. DeepSeek-V3 is small relative to its capabilities and has 671 billion parameters, while ChatGPT-4 has 1.76 trillion, which makes it easier to run. But DeepSeek-V3 still hits impressive benchmarks of understanding. Its smaller size comes in part by using a different architecture than ChatGPT, called a "mixture of experts." The model has pockets of expertise built in, which go into action when called upon and sit dormant when irrelevant to the query. This type of model is growing in popularity, and DeepSeek's advantage is that it built an extremely efficient version of an inherently efficient architecture. "Someone made this analogy: It's almost as if someone released a $20 iPhone," Jared Quincy Davis, the CEO of Foundry, told BI. The Chinese model used a fraction of the time, a fraction of the number of chips, and a less capable, less expensive chip cluster. Essentially, it's a drastically cheaper, competitively capable model that the firm is virtually giving away for free. Bernstein analysts said that DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model more comparable to OpenAI's o1 or o3, is even more concerning from a competitive standpoint. This model uses reasoning techniques to interrogate its own responses and thinking, similar to OpenAI's latest reasoning models. R1 was built on top of V3, but the research paper released with the more advanced model doesn't include information about the hardware stack behind it. DeepSeek used strategies like generating its own training data to train R1, which requires more compute than using data scraped from the internet or generated by humans. This technique is often referred to as "distillation" and is becoming standard practice, Ambati said. Distillation brings with it another layer of controversy, though. A company using its own models to distill a smarter, smaller model is one thing. But the legality of using other company's models to distill new ones depends on licensing. Still, DeepSeek's techniques are more iterative and likely to be taken up by the AI indsutry immediately. For years, model developers and startups have focused on smaller models since their size makes them cheaper to build and operate. The thinking was that small models would serve specific tasks. But what DeepSeek and potentially OpenAI's o3 mini demonstrate is that small models can also be generalists. A coalition of players including Oracle and OpenAI, with cooperation from the White House, announced Stargate, a $500 billion data center project in Texas — the latest in a quick procession of developments in large-scale conversion to accelerated computing. DeepSeek's surprise release has called that investment into question, and Nvidia, the largest beneficiary of the investment, is on a roller coaster as a result. The company's stock plummeted more than 13% Monday. But Bernstein said the response is out of step with the reality. "DeepSeek DID NOT 'build OpenAI for $5M'," Bernstein analysts wrote in a Monday investor note. The panic, especially on X, is blown out of proportion, the analysts said. DeepSeek's own research paper on V3 says: "The aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data." So the $5 million figure is only part of the equation. "The models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles," Bernstein continued. Last week China also announced a roughly $140 billion investment in data centers, in a sign that infrastructure is still needed despite DeepSeek's achievements. The competition for model supremacy is fierce, and OpenAI's moat may indeed be in question. But demand for chips shows no signs of slowing, Bernstein said. Tech leaders are circling back to a centuries-old economic adage to explain the moment. The Jevons paradox is the idea that innovation begets demand. As technology gets cheaper or more efficient, demand increases much faster than prices drop. That's what providers of computing power, such as Foundry's Jared Quincy Davis, have been espousing for years. This week, Bernstein and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella picked up the mantle, too. "Jevons paradox strikes again!" Nadella posted on X Monday morning. "As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of."

Title: The Alarming National Security Implications of DeepSeek and China’s A.I. Breakthrough

Wall Street started the week in a cold sweat thanks to DeepSeek, an obscure Chinese A.I. lab that just dropped a bombshell: a lightning-fast, budget-friendly large language model that’s shaking Silicon Valley to its core. The Hangzhou-based firm claims to have developed it over just two months at a cost under $6 million, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia (NVDA), whose stock dropped by more than 15 percent early Monday (Jan. 27). If this newcomer, established in mid-2023, can produce a reliable A.I. model that’s cheaper and faster than existing apps, that’s a stunning blow to U.S. firms such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta (META). DeepSeek’s new A.I. app is already available online, including at Apple’s app store, and it’s moving fast. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The timing of this couldn’t be worse for American business, given President Donald Trump’s audacious announcement last week of a new $500 billion initiative termed Stargate AI, involving OpenAI, SoftBank (SFTBF) and Oracle, which Trump promised would ensure “the future of technology” for America, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process. Has that promising vision already evaporated? It’s too soon to say, but it’s now evident that America and China are in a tight race to harness the power of A.I. for the world. Comparisons to the U.S.-Soviet Cold War “space race” are impossible to miss, and many are comparing DeepSeek’s innovation to the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, in 1957, which shocked Americans with the realization that Moscow reached space before we did. Like Sputnik, DeepSeek’s claimed progress has alarming national security implications. While Wall Street is worried about valuations, the Pentagon is fretting over Chinese advances in A.I. that may give the People’s Liberation Army an edge in warfare. Given how top U.S. military leaders assess that our increasingly open conflict with Beijing may devolve into severe fighting during Trump’s second term, this is no idle threat. The Pentagon’s interest in A.I. and its military implications is hardly new. Five years ago, the Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center was expanded to support warfighting plans, not just experiment with new technology. Last year, Craig Martell, the Pentagon’s top A.I. official, pronounced that new technology was revolutionizing how DoD does business. As Martell explained: “Imagine a world where combatant commanders can see everything they need to see to make strategic decisions … Imagine a world where those combatant commanders aren’t getting that information via PowerPoint or via emails from across the [organization] — the turnaround time for situational awareness shrinks from a day or two to ten minutes.” While the vaunted “fog of war” can never be fully lifted, A.I. promises to cut through the haze faster and with a precision never seen in the history of warfare. A.I. will reduce the information burden on military staff with speed and accuracy, enabling a tighter “decision loop” for U.S. generals and admirals. If DeepSeek’s innovation is all it’s being sold as, Beijing may have gained a decisive advantage that will enable the PLA to out-think and outmaneuver the U.S. military in any confrontation in the Western Pacific, most likely over Taiwan. The U.S. Intelligence Community is just as concerned about China’s A.I. progress. In recent years, America’s spy agencies have spent prodigious sums on determining how to harness A.I. to boost the speed and accuracy of intelligence assessments. A.I. can tamp down the “information firehose” that hampers the speedy analysis of complex intelligence problems, employing technology to make human assessments faster and more precise. Last summer, Lakshmi Raman, the Central Intelligence Agency’s top A.I. official, illuminated how this works. “Imagine all of the news stories that come in every minute of every day from around the world. That is also the data that we are neck deep in, and that we’ve got to leverage A.I. in order to help us to triage,” she explained, adding that A.I. was boosting CIA’s clandestine intelligence collection, not just analysis. The National Security Agency, too, has embraced A.I. with gusto, recognizing its game-changing potential for sifting through vast amounts of collected intelligence data to find the puzzle pieces of national security value. NSA is also protecting America from foreign A.I. programs, and the agency recently established the Artificial Intelligence Security Center. As NSA’s Director General Timothy Haugh stated, “When an enterprise runs A.I. systems, it opens up to new attack surfaces in the AI development lifecycle and A.I. abilities in model inference services. We need to secure and protect these systems from threats and buy down risks today.” That threat from foreign A.I. just got a boost with DeepSeek’s claimed progress. The good news here is that nobody’s certain of how real China’s A.I. progress actually is. Communists lie frequently. The Soviet success with Sputnik, boosted by Moscow’s putting Yuri Gagarin in space in 1961, a month before America did the same, proved illusory. The Soviet space program was hampered by quality and safety problems, and despite early Kremlin propaganda feats, America won the space race with the 1969 Moon landing. The bad news is that the clock’s ticking. John R.

Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek said it would temporarily limit signups after being the victim of “large-scale malicious attacks” on its servers. Existing users can log in without problems, the company said on its website. Earlier on Monday, the company said it would restrict signups for new users to people with a mainland China phone number. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open-source large language model, which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company launched a model that it said rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+3.08%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL+3.94%) App Store over the weekend. DeepSeek says it built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia (NVDA+6.73%), which could put pressure on the major semiconductor maker. The reported cyberattacks come as DeepSeek’s advanced technology sparked a widespread sell-off on Monday morning. Nvidia’s stock plunged more than 15%, wiping out $18 billion of founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML-0.92%), Broadcom (AVGO+0.67%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-3.56%), Micron (MU-2.46%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+3.84%) The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell by more than 600 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, took a hit earlier on Monday but has since bounced back to a net 48-point gain. The S&P 500 is down almost 2%, or 107 points. “[T]he Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution,” Wedbush Securities analysts led by Dan Ives said in a note. “While the model is impressive and it will have a ripple impact,” they added, U.S. tech companies are focused on achieving artificial general intelligence, with a focus on “the infrastructure and ecosystem that China and especially DeepSeek cannot come close to in our view.” —Rocio Fabbro and Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands against the other AI stocks. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. AI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank JPMorgan. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT professionals working on a digital platform, indicating the company's agile digital services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a California-based real estate trust that operates data centers and other technology assets. In February 2024, Equinix partnered with NVIDIA to launch a private cloud service, enabling organizations to manage NVIDIA DGX supercomputing infrastructure for developing custom generative AI models. In November 2024, Equinix announced the construction of a sixth International Business Exchange data center in Singapore, named SG6. With an initial investment of $260 million, SG6 will operate on renewable energy and feature liquid cooling capabilities to support compute-intensive AI workloads. These AI-focused developments have positively impacted the financial performance of the firm. In the first half of 2024, the company experienced increased demand for data center services, driven by an artificial intelligence land grab among tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. This surge in demand allowed Equinix to raise rents, with prices for hyperscale tech tenants increasing by 19% during this period. Overall EQIX ranks 26th on our list of the important AI stocks for 2025 according to JP Morgan. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than EQIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time.

Title: Federal Policies Set A New Tone For Business

Plus: UnitedMasters CEO On Pivoting Recording To Tech, Lack Of Tariffs Kept Markets Steady, How Federal Return-To-Office Policy Could Impact The Private Sector, OpenAI Unveils A Smooth Operator What a difference a week can make. Last Monday, Donald Trump was sworn in for a second term as president. In seven days, executive orders and policy pronouncements have shaken the U.S. and countries globally as he is changing how the United States government does business in terms of employment, immigration policy, criminal justice and diplomacy. And while shifts in the federal government’s internal operations don’t necessarily impact how the private sector runs, it sets a tone, and could inspire businesses to make changes. One of the most prevalent policy shifts is in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. An executive order signed on the first day of Trump’s presidency ends federal DEI programs, saying that “illegal and immoral” plans in every government department intended to ensure better representation of genders, races and backgrounds throughout government “demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination.” DEI initiatives throughout the government were formally shut down two days later, and employees who worked in DEI offices were immediately put on paid leave. According to a memo, each department is to plan for staff reductions for DEI employees by January 31. Another executive order from Trump brings this crackdown to the private sector. He rescinded a 1965 anti-discrimination order for federal contractors from President Lyndon B. Johnson, requiring agencies to identify contractors who use “coded or imprecise language” to “obscure” DEI initiatives, as well as identifying up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of private sector entities “to deter DEI programs or principles…that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.” The attorney general will take this information and issue a report of recommendations to take action within 120 days. Even before Trump took office, popularity of DEI initiatives among businesses was already waning. Last week, Target scaled back some of its policies, phasing out its goals to increase hiring and promotions of people of color and women, pulling its participation from external diversity surveys, phasing out anti-racism training, and shifting its supplier diversity team to focus on supplier engagement. But some companies are digging in on diversity. Costco’s shareholders almost unanimously bucked a challenge to its diversity policies, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The National Center for Public Policy Research had petitioned the retailer to audit the company’s “litigation, reputational and financial risks” caused by its DEI policies. Costco’s leadership rejected the proposal last month and urged shareholders to vote it down, saying that the retailer regularly evaluates its policies. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also stood firm in his commitment to DEI initiatives, saying, “Bring them on” in an interview with CNBC last week, Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly writes. The fight over diversity will continue to play out everywhere, and how policies will ultimately be decided is unclear. Time—as well as future measures of the broader economy, company offerings and demographic statistics—will tell. One thing that has remained constant, regardless of who’s in the White House, is technology’s disruption of more traditional industries. The music business has seen a lot of change over the last generation. I talked to Steve Stoute, a former record company executive who founded the tech-enabled and creator-empowering enterprise UnitedMasters. I talked to him about his path to reinventing an old industry. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump gives a thumbs up to the crowd after speaking at a rally in Las Vegas on Saturday. One thing that didn’t see a ton of change the week Trump took office: the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all moved up less than three points last week, with a bump last Tuesday—the first day of trading in Trump’s second term—and small ups and downs through Friday, largely from earnings reports and other more normal business indicators. A key reason for less volatility in trading is that Trump has held back on putting tariffs in place. He’s threatened tariffs on several nations—Canada and Mexico starting February 1, on Russia if it doesn’t end the war with Ukraine, higher ones for China if it doesn’t cooperate with the sale of TikTok, and on Colombia over not accepting deportees. If and when tariffs actually are announced and prices are likely to change, markets may see bigger swings. The economy is on many peoples’ minds, but consumers are still spending. The National Retail Federation reported that November and December retail sales were a record $994.1 billion, 4% higher than 2023, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Holiday spending exceeded predictions of 2.5% to 3.5% growth. But this growth wasn’t just for the holiday season. Sales for 2024 as a whole grew a record 3.6% to a record $5.28 trillion, the NRF found. The growth is expected to continue, Deloitte reported in its 2025 retail industry outlook, Forbes senior contributor Joan Verdon wrote. The firm predicts that consumer spending will grow by 3.1% in 2025. While this level of spending might be good for business bottom lines, it might not be the best thing for the economy as a whole. In Q3, credit card balances nationwide hit $1.17 trillion—an increase of $24 billion—and 3.5% of all household debt was in some form of delinquency, according to statistics from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Consumer confidence also is declining, with the Conference Board seeing a drop of 8.1 points in December. The expectations index—based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business and the labor market—fell 12.6 points to 81.1, just above 80, which usually is a benchmark for a coming recession. getty Another big change for federal workers that may bleed into the private sector: An end to most remote work. Trump signed an executive order mandating federal employees work in the office five days a week. Forbes contributor Terina Allen writes that most of the government’s 2.3 million civilian employees—about 54%—work entirely on-site already, and just 10% work entirely remotely. Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly writes that this new policy is likely to also make employees quit government jobs, bringing de facto cuts to the size of the federal workforce. This new policy could have a trickle-down effect on the private sector, with more employers—who have wanted more employees spending more time in the office anyway—making the same moves themselves. However, there could be some downsides to following the federal government’s lead. It might ultimately damage workplace culture, making employees feel like they are not trusted, career expert Jasmine Escalera of MyPerfectResume told HR Executive. Meanwhile, some remote-work-friendly executives told MarketWatch that they plan to capitalize on the federal government’s move, attracting highly qualified candidates with a more flexible work environment. They said that the benefits of remote work are clear, and this plan is a step backward. Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Politics aside—even though Trump tried to make some of it political—some big advancements in AI were announced in the last week. On the apolitical front, OpenAI unveiled its “Operator” AI assistant. The company described this tool as an “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you,” completing tasks including making online grocery orders and ticket purchases, downloading lectures, combining PDFs and calculating refunds. It isn’t totally autonomous, and asks users for confirmation before tasks like sending emails or completing orders. It is first be available in a research preview to ChatGPT Pro users. On the potentially political end of the spectrum, Trump unveiled a $500 billion AI infrastructure partnership called “Stargate” between Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank. This partnership will build several state-of-the-art AI data centers across the U.S. to expand computing power for new developments in the tech space. It’s the type of project Biden had prioritized, signing an executive order before he left office, the Washington Post reported, and that OpenAI had been lobbying for. The Stargate project could help the U.S. keep its lead in AI development, as long as it can figure out several key issues detailed by Forbes contributor Emil Sayegh, including who’s in charge of the sprawling initiative, how data centers will get the electricity they need, and where highly skilled workers who can operate these centers will come from. (Musk has also questioned how solid SoftBank’s funding may be, though it’s unclear if his trolling merely stems from his long-running feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.) Not to be outdone, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Friday plans to spend $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year, with much of that going to AI efforts. Zuckerberg said the company will expand AI teams significantly, and predicted the company’s Llama 4 large language model will become “the leading state-of-the-art” AI model this year. UnitedMasters founder and CEO Steve Stoute, and the "UnitedMasters: A Celebration Of Independence" event at the 65th Grammy Awards. With a career in the music business that started in the 1990s, Steve Stoute has long been a key leader in the space. He served as an executive at Sony Music and Interscope Geffen A&M, then started advertising agency Translation. In 2017, he started UnitedMasters, a technology-driven company that lets artists develop music, get licensing and promotion and reach brand partnerships without going through the traditional record label process. UnitedMasters is valued at $550 million, and its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Alphabet and 20th Century Fox. I talked to Stoute about reinventing a legacy business for today’s tech landscape. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. What kind of knowledge and background did you bring to founding UnitedMasters from your years in the traditional recording industry? How did you pivot your expertise? Stoute: I’ve been in the business since ’91. It had gone through such a bad time since MP3s hit, and then it started to migrate into iTunes. Artists had lost. They didn’t know where the revenue was, what the business would be. It was a period of eight years of decline, decline of market share, and no one had a clue what the solution would be. When iTunes came, the good news was that people were paying for music again. The bad news was the price of it was so low, the delta between what it was and what it is going to be was so far off that people had to readjust to these new economics. That’s why you started to see the rise of merch and other items being sold. It was like, ‘Okay, I can’t monetize the music, so let me monetize the higher margin item like a T-shirt or a hoodie.’ Everybody had gotten into that business because there was no more money left just selling records. To me, that was a very clear path, and I wanted to use my understanding of the business and my access to technology. I worked very closely with Ben Horowitz [of Andreessen Horowitz]. He’s on the board of my company. I wanted to work very closely with technology to help build what would be the technical solve for the music business of the future. What advice would you give to an aspiring CEO or leader like you were: They have deep knowledge of a traditional business but they want to start something new that adapts to the times we’re in now? When you’re beginning, ideas don’t come out fully formed and they only become clear as you work on them. You really just have to get started. This whole idea that there’s this eureka moment and then all of a sudden it hits you is actually a dangerous lie. Because you feel like until you have that eureka moment, you’re not prepared to do anything, so you are waiting for this lightning to strike, that never strikes. The key is to move forward with that commitment, so that beautiful journey becomes clear. How did it happen for you? How did you get from feeling that you wanted to do something in this space to building it into UnitedMasters? When I look back at it, in hindsight, I was actually going through a very tough time in my life. Jay-Z and [Interscope Records cofounder and longtime CEO] Jimmy Iovine were both leaving the [traditional] music industry. Jimmy was building a company called Beats Music, which ended up becoming Apple Music, and Jay-Z had bought this [music streaming] company called Tidal. I’m like, if those guys are going into the streaming business, what that means to me is that distribution as we knew it is fully dead. That they’ve accepted that Spotify had no competitors. I’m like, if they’re gone and they’re going after Spotify because they have no competitors, what that means is that the barrier for artists to get to distribution was no longer going to be physical and capital intensive. Those are just two data points that I had. I took those two data points and began to put together an idea that became UnitedMasters. It was certainly not when I was on my front foot. I wasn’t doing great. It wasn’t the optimum time to have an idea, but I kept on thinking about the idea. As I got better, and I became more who I already am, I was like, this is not a good idea. This is a great idea. It’s the future. What I didn’t know was how early I was going to be, and I would reckon to you I was too early. But when you speak to the great VCs, they’ll tell you the gift and the curse of being early is: When you’re early, when you have vision, you see it early, and when you see it early, it just takes longer to happen. So don’t feel bad for being early. If you see it early, that means your vision is really good. Get prepared for the long run, pack enough clothes—AKA get the funding you need, get people who believe in your vision, because it’s going to be a minute. Always stay sharpening your vision because it’s going to happen in iterations over time. You’ve got to always be able to modify as conditions change. The baseline truth won’t change, but some things around it may change. Mergers and acquisitions, new technologies, all these things. You’ve got to be able to be committed to your vision, but yet nimble enough to do what you’ve got to do as things evolve.

Title: Private Credit’s Big Squeeze: How the Arms Race for Scale Is Reshaping the Market

Time Published: 2025-01-27T17:17:48Z

Private credit is in the midst of an arms race as mega-managers scramble to dominate this booming segment of the asset management industry. BlackRock (BLK)’s announced acquisition of HPS Investment Partners in December—its second manager acquisition of the year—highlights an accelerating consolidation trend that promises both opportunities for the largest funds and potential challenges for the market. In addition, Goldman Sachs (GS)’ recent creation of its Capital Solutions Group, a business unit focused on private credit advisory and investing, and JPMorgan Chase’s partnerships with several private credit firms underscore Wall Street’s largest banks’ determination to capitalize on the growth of private credit. Could this rush of capital to industry giants leave middle-market lenders—and the vital swath of American businesses they serve—starved for capital at a time when traditional bank lending remains constrained?

You can opt out anytime. The advantages of economies of scale in asset management are compelling and well-documented. Asset manager revenue is directly tied to the amount of assets under management (AUM). As firms increase AUM, their fixed costs for technology, research and infrastructure can be spread across a larger base, effectively reducing the per-dollar cost of managing client funds. Large asset managers can also negotiate better terms with service providers and counterparties, enabling these firms to develop more sophisticated investment capabilities and risk management systems, which, in theory, can lead to better returns. In addition to scaling AUM, BlackRock’s acquisition of Preqin, a leading private market data vendor, last year highlights its intent to not only grow managed assets but also differentiate its platform by building infrastructure and capabilities that it can vertically integrate into its core investing functions. The benefits of scale, however, may have diminishing returns beyond certain thresholds. As funds grow in size, deploying capital effectively becomes more challenging—fewer deals are large enough for these firms to allocate capital efficiently. This dynamic creates a consolidation paradox: as private credit managers achieve greater scale, they necessarily focus on mega deals, creating potential market inefficiencies that could undermine the industry’s original purpose. The unprecedented inflow of capital to private credit has spurred the industry’s growth, but with a majority of capital flowing to the largest managers, it’s dramatically widening the gap between the large funds and smaller players. For smaller funds, this shift has been stark. Preqin data shows the 10 largest private credit funds claimed 51 percent of capital raised through the third quarter of 2023, compared to 35 percent for all of 2022. For funds outside of the top 50, the share of capital raised plummeted from 22 percent to 9 percent over the same period. As the largest private credit managers scale, it threatens to create a void in middle-market lending. While a $50 million direct lending deal might fit with a $1 billion AUM fund, it’s inefficient for a fund with several hundred billion dollars in AUM to deploy resources to small deals that would account for a de minimis percent of overall returns. With fewer funds willing to deploy capital to middle-market deals, what happens to these businesses that find themselves with less access to capital? With nearly 200,000 such companies accounting for over one-third of U.S. GDP and employing 48 million people, the potential credit vacuum for these borrowers represents more than just a market inefficiency; it’s a structural challenge that could stifle economic growth and innovation. This consolidation pattern mirrors developments in private equity, where mid-sized firms increasingly find themselves in an existential crisis. As Goldman Sachs’ Mike Brandmeyer recently observed, many PE firms “stuck in the middle” face a stark choice between making significant investments to scale up or selling to larger platforms that already have the necessary infrastructure. With institutional investors showing a clear preference for either the largest or newest managers, this “barbelling” effect is forcing consolidation across alternative assets. This pattern reveals a stark irony in the industry’s evolution. The private credit industry was primarily borne out as a response to post-financial crisis regulations that made it costly for banks to serve smaller, riskier borrowers. Yet, as private credit managers consolidate and scale, they appear to follow a similar path to the banks they initially sought to replace, prioritizing larger, more profitable clients at the expense of smaller businesses. For small and mid-sized managers, the changing landscape demands strategic adaptation. Some are finding success through sector specialization or by building stronger regional relationships. Others are exploring partnerships or technological solutions as alternatives to traditional scale advantages. The non-sponsored deal market, or direct lending, where competition tends to be less intense, offers another avenue for differentiation. Specifically, according to the IMF, about 70 percent of private credit deals go to sponsor-backed companies, leaving a significant opportunity for managers to capitalize on direct lending transactions. While requiring more intensive origination efforts, these direct-to-company relationships can offer attractive economics and deeper borrower relationships compared to sponsor-backed deals, as lenders aren’t competing with multiple sponsors’ existing lending relationships. While private credit operating outside the traditional banking system limits the systemic risk imposed on the overall financial system, their interconnectedness and substantial market share naturally raise questions about market stability and contagion risk during periods of stress. For example, stress at any single major private credit player could have outsized effects on market stability and credit availability to both large and mid-sized businesses The future of private credit will be defined by those who can balance scale with efficiency. Mega-managers must find ways to serve smaller borrowers without sacrificing efficiency, while mid-sized players need to lean into specialization and innovation to stay relevant. Ultimately, the winners will be those who can adapt without losing sight of the industry’s original mission—filling the credit gaps that banks left behind. Banks are increasingly partnering with private credit funds to provide their commercial clients with alternative financing options when traditional bank loans aren’t feasible—a sign of how the market is adapting to serve borrower needs. The private credit market’s continued evolution will test whether these innovations can effectively balance the advantages of scale with the necessity of serving a diverse borrower base.

Title: Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is rattling markets. Here's what to know
URL: https://qz.com/china-ai-startup-deepseek-r1-v3-openai-reasoning-model-1851748222
Time Published: 2025-01-27T17:15:00Z
Full Content:
A Chinese artificial intelligence startup is rattling Silicon Valley and Wall Street after it demonstrated AI models on par with OpenAI’s — for a fraction of the cost and energy. At just over a year old, Hangzhou-based DeepSeek released results for its latest open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, last week. The models showed a comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models, o1-mini and o1, on several industry benchmarks. In December, DeepSeek released a different model that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia H800 chips, which have reduced capabilities compared to chips used by U.S. firms. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on cutting-edge chips from Nvidia (NVDA+6.73%). The release of DeepSeek-R1 has sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks, with Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P500 futures all falling Monday morning. Here’s what to know about DeepSeek and its AI models. The Chinese AI startup was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, co-founder of Chinese quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer Capital Management. DeepSeek was reportedly formed out of High-Flyer’s AI research unit to focus on developing artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which is when AI reaches human-level intelligence. DeepSeek develops open-source models, which means developers have access to and can work on its software. DeepSeek introduced its first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1, last week. DeepSeek-R1-Zero was trained by large-scale reinforcement learning and without supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek said. The model “demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities,” but has challenges with “poor readability” and mixing language, according to the startup. Meanwhile, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, has surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL+3.94%) App Store downloads, while the DeepSeek site is experiencing outages from an influx of new users. The startup announced “large-scale malicious attacks” on Monday, prompting a temporary limit on registrations. The chatbot was powered by DeepSeek-V3, which DeepSeek said performed comparably with Meta’s (META+3.08%) Llama 3.1 and OpenAI’s 4o at its release in December. Unlike ChatGPT and its other chatbot competitors, DeepSeek explains its “reasoning” before responding to inquiries. However, the Chinese-developed chatbot does not directly answer prompts about politically sensitive topics such as President Xi Jinping or Taiwan. According to DeepSeek, R1 performed comparably with OpenAI’s and Meta’s models on leading benchmarks such as the AIME 2024, which tests mathematics, and the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) which evaluates general knowledge. On the community-driven Chatbot Arena leaderboard, DeepSeek-R1 comes in under Google’s (GOOGL+1.70%) Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model and ChatGPT-4o. DeepSeek-V3, meanwhile, fell just below OpenAI’s o1-preview and full o1 models. Meta, which also develops open-source models, is reportedly concerned that the next version of its flagship Llama will fall behind DeepSeek’s models. Specialized groups of researchers at Meta are looking into DeepSeek’s models for ways to improve the next Llama model, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. DeepSeek’s seemingly efficient and competitive models could challenge Nvidia’s business, which relies on major AI firms such as OpenAI, Meta, and Google spending billions of dollars on its GPUs. In a technical report for its V3 model, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia for training — much less than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. Meta, for example, used 16,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H100s to train its Llama 3 405B model. Last week, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the tech giant is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures on AI in 2025. He added that Meta’s Llama 4 model is expected to “become the leading state of the art model” this year, and that the company plans to “build an AI engineer” that can contribute more code to its research and development efforts. Meanwhile, OpenAI, SoftBank (SFTBY-0.37%), and Oracle (ORCL+3.88%) recently announced a half-a-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure plan with the Trump administration called Stargate. The new joint venture “intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,” the AI startup said in a statement. Aside from prompting questions about AI chip spending, DeepSeek’s success challenges U.S. efforts to curb advanced chips from entering the country. According to its technical report, DeepSeek used Nvidia’s H800 chips for its V3 model, which are a less powerful version of the chipmaker’s H100s that it is allowed to sell to Chinese firms under U.S. chip restrictions. Before leaving office earlier this month, the Biden administration introduced even more measures focused on keeping AI chips out of China. The new regulations reinforce and build upon previous U.S. export controls aimed at restricting China from advanced semiconductors that can be used for AI and military development. Under the rules, foundries and packaging companies that want to export certain chips are subject to a broader license requirement unless certain conditions are met. The U.S. also published new guidelines aimed at curbing AI chip sales from U.S. firms, including Nvidia, to specific countries and companies. The new export controls include three tiers of chip restrictions, which give friendly nations full access to U.S.-made chips but add new limitations to others.

Title: Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR): AI-Driven Innovations Propel Growth Amid $14 Billion HPE Acquisition

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) stands against the other AI stocks. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users.

AI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time.

Sean Pyles: Insurance is designed to protect you from financial ruin when unlikely but potentially catastrophic events occur. Sara Rathner: But what happens when those potentially catastrophic events become more and more likely to happen? Sean Pyles: This episode, we’ll help you understand how to think about protecting your home and other assets with insurance as climate disasters increase in frequency. Welcome to NerdWallet's Smart Money podcast. I'm Sean Pyles. Sara Rathner: And I'm Sara Rathner. This episode we'll answer a listener's question about whether money market accounts are better than high-yield savings accounts and how to know which one to use to meet your savings goals. Sean Pyles: But first, we are going to talk about a significant nationwide issue coming up in the aftermath of the fires in and around Los Angeles. In fact, an issue that's been building with each weather-related catastrophe: it's the skyrocketing cost of home insurance. Sara Rathner: If you're a homeowner, you're probably already seeing this in your monthly bills, and if you're a renter, this affects you too because your landlord has to pay insurance for your building. Sean Pyles: We're joined now by Caitlin Constantine. She oversees home insurance coverage here at NerdWallet. Caitlin did a special series for us back in the spring of 2023 on the financial ramifications of climate change. We did an entire episode on what was happening with home insurance in the wake of floods, hurricanes, fires, tornadoes, and everything else Mother Nature throws at us. So we're getting the latest on this to help you cope with a future that is rapidly changing. Caitlin, welcome back. Caitlin Constantine: Thanks, Sean and Sara, I'm always happy to join you, but my gosh, the circumstances for this conversation could not be worse. Sara Rathner: Yeah. What's happened and is happening in and around Los Angeles is a disaster of staggering proportions. You have tens of thousands of folks who are displaced, many who no longer have a home, and it's not like there are homes to spare in that part of the country. So what these fire victims are facing is not only finding shelter, but figuring out where they're going to eventually live. And that's getting more and more complex because insurance companies are pulling out of a lot of these climate change crisis zones, right? Caitlin Constantine: Right. We've seen Florida, California, and Louisiana all have challenges with keeping insurers for a variety of reasons, but underpinning all of this is the fact that climate-related disasters are becoming more common, more extreme, and more costly. So let's take California. Over the past few years, California has actually seen several major insurers like Allstate, State Farm, and Farmers either stop writing new home insurance policies or decline to renew other policies. In fact, in July, State Farm dropped about 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades alone. Insurers say that the cost of paying for wildfire losses has been greater than what they were able to collect in premiums, so they chose to reduce how much they were covering in the state instead of continuing to take those losses. Sean Pyles: And just last month, California's insurance commissioner released new rules that were supposed to bolster the insurance market in the state. Where might that play out in this recovery effort? Caitlin Constantine: So these new regulations require insurers to write more home insurance policies in areas with high risk of wildfire. In exchange, those insurers can make changes in how they set their rates, and that's likely going to result in higher premiums. To put it simply, more California homeowners will likely have access to home insurance, but they're going to have to pay more for it. The regulations may be starting to work as intended, as some insurers have recently announced that they would resume business in the state. But that said, we don't know how the wildfires are going to impact this. Now, it's also worth noting that there's a one-year moratorium on dropping home insurance policies in the areas affected by the LA wildfires. The California Insurance Commissioner also called on insurance companies to rescind non-renewals that were issued in the 90 days before the wildfires and to also cancel pending non-renewals. These moves should help homeowners maintain coverage when they begin to rebuild after the fires. Sara Rathner: But this isn't a new story, is it? We've seen this happening all over the country. You already mentioned Florida, California, Louisiana. We also saw storms in Western North Carolina this summer and all these places that have gone through enormous tragedy. These extreme weather events end up jacking up insurance prices. Caitlin Constantine: Sadly, it's becoming more and more common. We've been seeing home insurance costs increase around the country as extreme weather becomes more destructive and happens more frequently. And it's not just the usual suspects like Florida, Louisiana, and California. Last month, the Senate Budget Committee released a report on climate change and insurance that indicated parts of Southern New England, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and the Carolinas may not be far behind. That report also warns that if these trends continue, we're going to start to see this impact property values. Sean Pyles: Caitlin, I know you have some personal experience with this issue. You live in Asheville, North Carolina, where Hurricane Helene brought so much destruction last fall. What have you seen in insurance rates in the wake of natural disasters that hit where you live? Caitlin Constantine: Well, it's a little soon for us to know how much our premiums will go up, but we do know that last week North Carolina's Insurance Commissioner approved an average rate of increase of about 15% across the state that will take effect by the middle of next year. So it's safe to say that many of us are going to pay more for home insurance. I will say that one thing we do know for sure posed a huge problem for us: a lack of flood insurance. So standard home insurance doesn't cover flood damage. You have to have flood insurance specifically for that. In an analysis done by a local nonprofit news group, Asheville Watchdog, they found that less than 1% of the buildings in Buncombe County, which is where Asheville is located, were covered by flood insurance. So that means that a significant number of people who lost homes and businesses when the French Broad River flooded will not have nearly enough money to rebuild. And Asheville's not alone in this regard. A new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that people who live near inland rivers and streams are more likely to go without flood insurance than people who live near the coast. And unfortunately, the report also found that people who live near rivers tend to have fewer resources to recover than do people who live near coasts. Sara Rathner: I think it's sometimes easy for people to think, "Well, I don't live in an area that's threatened by these kinds of events, so this insurance discussion isn't relevant to me." But it actually is. Can you tell us about how the insurance losses from disasters that might even be far from where you live end up being paid for by all of us? Caitlin Constantine: Well, it's important to remember that the point of insurance is to spread the cost of recovering and rebuilding over a wider group of people instead of expecting individuals to shoulder those costs entirely on their own. And so it follows that when more of us file bigger claims more frequently, the pool of money we're being paid out from has to increase as well, and that's when premiums go up. I think it's an indicator of the scope of this problem that the cost of paying for weather-related damage has become so high that the increase is being felt even in places that don't see a lot of extreme weather. Sara Rathner: Can you give us a sense of how much more everyone is paying because of these rolling crises? Caitlin Constantine: Well, we've been seeing home insurance rates increase almost across the board for a few years now. Partly that's been due to inflation, but partly it's due to the aforementioned increase in severe weather. In 2023, premiums increased by more than 11%, according to S&P Global. And then in 2024, our average rate for home insurance in the U.S. was $160 a month or a little over $1,900 a year, and that was calculated before the most recent disasters in L.A., Florida, and North Carolina. So we're getting ready to do our analysis for the upcoming year, and we fully expect to see rates go up once again. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about what all of this means for the cost of housing in this country. How do insurance costs play into the rising price you have to pay for a house or even to rent? Caitlin Constantine: Well, in recent years, insurance premiums have become so costly for so many people that they now are paying more for insurance and taxes than for the mortgage itself. And this is yet another factor that's making homeownership unaffordable for so many people, especially first-time buyers. It's not just that the house itself has become so much more expensive, but it's also much more expensive to insure it. And if you have a mortgage, you can't go without insurance. Plus, it's no longer a predictable expense, as so many of us have seen big increases in our home insurance year over year. So even if you can swing the expense one year, who knows if you're going to be able to manage it three or four years down the road? And renters, this is going to impact you as well. Your landlord is going to end up paying more to insure that property, and those costs will be passed down to you. Sean Pyles: Let's get to some practical advice for folks who are facing, or very well could face in the future, some soaring insurance bills for their homes. Caitlin, can you give us three or four top things people can do right now to try to lower those bills? Caitlin Constantine: So first of all, if you get hit with a big insurance bill, you definitely should shop around for a new policy. We recommend getting quotes from at least three insurers. You can start on our site. If you do a search for NerdWallet home insurance quotes, you'll get a page and you can get started by entering your zip code on the page that comes up. When you are getting quotes, it's really important to make sure that the quotes have comparable levels of coverage so that you are measuring apples to apples. If insurance is scarce in your area, which it very well could be, your best bet is going to be working with an independent insurance agent. They will know about all of the good insurers who sell in your area, not just the ones with the big ad budgets or the goofy mascots. And another money-saving tactic is raising your deductible. We've found that if you raise your deductible from $1,000 to $2,500, you can save on average nearly 13% on your premium. But if you do this, it's super important to make sure you can cover that expense. And really, it's important that you make sure you read your policy carefully. You might have a separate deductible for hail or wind damage. In fact, your policy is going to have all kinds of details about possible exclusions or limitations, so it's really critical to read it and make sure you understand it. One thing we don't recommend doing to save money is reducing how much coverage you have. It may be tempting to save money by lowering your coverage limits, but if disaster strikes, you're going to be very glad you're not underinsured. Sean Pyles: Caitlin Constantine, thank you so much for helping us out today. Caitlin Constantine: Thanks so much for having me. Sara Rathner: In a moment, we'll turn to this episode's money question segment, where we help you dig into whether high-yield savings accounts live up to the hype or if other types of savings accounts might be better for you. Sean Pyles: But before we get into that, we're going to ask you, nerdy listener, to pause — literally perhaps — to think about where you need some guidance with your money. Sara Rathner: Maybe you're wondering about how to compare different insurance companies, or you're trying to break yourself out of a bad financial habit but just can't seem to do it.

And you can always email us at [email protected]. Sara Rathner: All right, let's get to this episode's money question segment. That's up next. Stay with us. Sean Pyles: We're back and answering your money questions to help you make smarter financial decisions. This episode's question comes from Aaron, who sent us an email. Here it is: "Hi, NerdWallet team. I wanted to reach out and share some thoughts on the topic I know you cover often, high-yield savings accounts. As someone who invests across platforms primarily with Vanguard, I have noticed that their Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund, while requiring a $3,000 minimum, consistently offers a higher annual return than most high-yield savings accounts. This raises a question in my mind. Aside from the convenience of short-term liquidity for bill payments or direct deposits, is there much advantage to high-yield savings accounts? The money market fund has no cap on purchases, is FDIC insured, and currently offers a 4.78% yield, which seems to outshine high-yield savings accounts for similar security." Sara Rathner: Aaron continues: "Thinking a bit deeper, it seems that financial institutions heavily market high-yield savings accounts, yet these often come in half a percent to 1% lower than similar money market funds. From what I see, this setup is quite profitable for banks. They enjoy liquidity from deposits while offering a quote-unquote high yield that still nets them a solid margin with minimal risk. High-yield savings accounts essentially allow institutions to secure a consistent return without needing to invest actively — a profit margin they might not achieve with conventional investment accounts. Given your expertise in high-yield savings, I'd love to hear your perspective. Do you agree with this assessment, and if so, why are high-yield accounts marketed as a beneficial product for the average saver?" To help us answer Aaron's question on this episode of the podcast, we are joined by Margarette Burnette. Margarette is a savings expert who has been writing about bank accounts for more than a decade. Her work has been featured in the Associated Press, USA Today, and other major media. Margarette, welcome to Smart Money. Margarette Burnette: Thank you for having me. I'm glad to be here. Sean Pyles: Hey Margarette. So let's start with the basics. What is the difference between a high-yield savings account and a money market account? Let's start with the money market account. What is it and where and how do you get one? Margarette Burnette: This is a great question, Sean, and I'm happy to answer it. But there is a point I'd like to clear up first in the terminology, because money market means different things depending on the context. So a money market mutual fund, like the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund, is an investment product. It's offered by a brokerage, not a bank. As a mutual fund, it pools investors' money into low-risk, short-term securities. So think government securities such as Treasury bills. This fund is not FDIC-insured. That's the key difference. A money market deposit account, on the other hand, is a bank product. It is a savings account that can sometimes come with check-writing features, but importantly, it is FDIC-insured. This means your money is protected by the federal government, and you can open one at a bank. Sean Pyles: And a high-yield savings account — this might seem obvious, especially because we do talk about them a lot on this show — but let's define those as well. Margarette Burnette: A high-yield savings account is also a bank product. It's simply a savings account that pays above-average rates. For example, the national average rate for savings accounts is currently less than half a percentage point, but you can find high-yield savings accounts that offer more than 4% annually. Also, like the money market deposit account, high-yield savings accounts are FDIC-insured, so your money is safe. Sara Rathner: Let's talk about this question of returns or interest that you would earn on money that you deposit in both of these types of accounts: money market deposit accounts — which is really just a type of savings account — and high-yield savings accounts, which of course are another type of savings account. Again, the listener was conflating money market deposit accounts with money market mutual funds. That’s a type of investment account. It's very different. So where do returns come from in a money market deposit account? Margarette Burnette: With money market deposit accounts, returns are based on interest rates set by the bank. They are generally tied to something called the federal funds rate, and rates can change at any time. That said, when you make your deposit, you typically know the rate you can expect, at least as of the day you make that deposit. Sara Rathner: And what about high-yield savings accounts — or really any savings accounts? Margarette Burnette: High-yield savings accounts work the same way as money market deposit accounts. Interest rates are set by banks and can change based on their market environment. Again, these are both different from money market mutual funds. Their returns are based on the performance of the securities the funds invest in, like Treasury bills, and these returns are called a yield. It's worth noting that future returns in a mutual fund are not guaranteed. Sean Pyles: So let's look at Aaron's example here. What would they want to think about when looking at these options for placing their money? Margarette Burnette: Here are a few things to think about. First, fees and minimum balances. You can find high-yield savings accounts that don't charge monthly fees and don't have minimum balance requirements. Money market mutual funds may charge an expense ratio, which is essentially a fee for the fund, and they may also have minimum balance requirements, as Aaron noted above. Next is your returns, of course. The higher your yield or the more interest you earn in the savings account, the faster your balance can grow. And finally, you'll want to think about access to your money. With savings accounts, if you have an ATM card, you may be able to go to an ATM machine and withdraw money instantly, or you could set up an automatic transfer that can be sent to a linked account within a day or so. Money market deposit accounts — those savings accounts — work similarly, with some giving you the ability to write a few checks each month. Sean Pyles: And now what about money market mutual funds? If someone does decide to put their money into one of these investment accounts, is getting your money from one of those accounts as easy as getting it from a money market deposit account or a high-yield savings account? Margarette Burnette: Some money market mutual funds do let you write checks as well, but there may be a minimum withdrawal requirement. Otherwise, to access your money, you may need to sell shares, and that could take a day or two to settle. I'll note that the savings accounts and money market deposit accounts with the highest rates do tend to be online accounts. So going to a local bank branch to withdraw money usually isn't an option, so you'll want to take that into account when making a decision about which one to open. Sean Pyles: Fortunately, our job here at NerdWallet is to make decisions like this easier. So I do want to mention that we have articles on the best high-yield savings accounts and the best money market deposit accounts on NerdWallet's website. You can check the NerdWallet rating, the APY, and any relevant bonus offers for each account, along with some of that other information we just talked about, like minimum balances and fees. And if you want, you can also look up money market mutual funds as well. We'll put links to those articles in today's show notes. Sara Rathner: Aaron also talks about what they think is behind the differences in the rates being offered. They think it's about profitability. Could you talk us through why a bank would be marketing or offering one versus the other? Margarette Burnette: Here's an important distinction. Banks market deposit products like checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market deposit accounts — they're FDIC insured for customers. Investment companies, on the other hand, market money market mutual funds. To be fair, these mutual funds are considered low-risk investments, but they don't come with insurance or guaranteed returns. Also, I should point out that some banks have investment arms, so it's possible to see both types of products under a similar brand. But the bank side would not market a mutual fund, and the investment side would not market a deposit product. Sean Pyles: And let's talk a bit about the role of FDIC insurance here. Can you lay that out for us, Margarette? Margarette Burnette: FDIC insurance is a safety net that guarantees your bank deposits up to $250,000 per depositor per bank. So even if the bank goes under, your money is protected. Now, there are regulations for mutual funds, but funds don't have that FDIC guarantee. Sean Pyles: And again, to get back to Aaron's question, it seems like they're making this apples-to-oranges comparison. They say they can get a return of 4.78% on their investment account, while savings accounts may offer a yield of closer to around 4% as of this recording. I want to quickly state that each account would serve a different purpose. It's generally not a great idea to have your savings in an investment account in case you do need to draw on that money in an emergency. Margarette Burnette: In general, I'd suggest folks poke around with a savings calculator to see how much you could earn with a rate of 4.5%, for example, compared with a rate of, say, 5% or 4%. Depending on how much money you have in your account, an account with a slightly higher rate may not net you that much more. Sean Pyles: So the lesson here is to do a bit of research to find those higher returns for yourself. They could go in either direction with these options. Margarette Burnette: Absolutely. This is especially true when you consider any fees that could be taken out of your returns with the money market mutual fund, for example. Sara Rathner: Do you have any other final advice for our listeners as they chase higher returns in an environment where interest rates are coming down, but sometimes they're faced with products that sound like they're the same thing but are actually completely different things? Margarette Burnette: That's very true. A couple of different issues here, and my answer to both is to shop around. It's not a given that money market mutual funds — which, again, are investment accounts — always offer better results than the best high-yield savings accounts. You'll want to check out up-to-date lists of the top high-yield savings accounts and money market deposit accounts because you may find some that offer better rates compared to the yields on money market mutual funds. In addition, if you know you won't need the money right away, you can consider looking at a certificate of deposit. If rates fall, then locking in today's CD rates could ultimately give you a better yield than all of the previous options. The key is you generally won't be able to make a withdrawal with CDs until the term is over. So, say for a one-year CD, you'd agree not to make a withdrawal for one year. Overall, depending on your goals, a CD, a high-yield savings account, money market deposit account, or money market mutual fund could be the right choice. Sean Pyles: Margarette, thank you so much for coming on and clarifying all these different accounts and who they might be best for. Margarette Burnette: Thank you.

Title: What Is DeepSeek? China Shocks AI Industry With 'Sputnik Moment'

Chinese AI company DeepSeek released an AI model that is sending shockwaves through the US tech industry due to its low cost and high performance. Tech investor Marc Andreessen calls it "AI's Sputnik moment," causing US tech stocks to tumble this morning, with Nvidia the hardest hit, down 11%. The app surpassed ChatGPT on the Apple App Store as the most-downloaded free application. But after receiving a flood of registrations and "large-scale malicious attacks"—possibly a DDoS attack—DeepSeek has "temporarily" restricted access to those with a +86 mainland Chinese phone number. You may still be able to sign in with a Google account. We downloaded it from the app store before this, and found the interface nearly identical to ChatGPT. It currently has a knowledge cutoff of October 2023, as shown in the screenshot below. But the big game-changer is not the chatbot experience but the open-source model that powers it on the backend. It appears to be the highest-performing available for an ultra-low price. Being open source, anyone with the right skills can download it and use it. The model, dubbed R1, came out on Jan. 20, a few months after DeepSeek released its first model. The company says its performance is "on par with OpenAI-o1,” the model OpenAI debuted in September 2024 with the ability to follow a chain of thought. The company called the approach a "new paradigm" that would bring AI models closer to human-level intelligence. Looking at the pricing specs for the DeepSeek R1 reasoner model and OpenAI's GPT-o1, you'll see R1 is a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek charges $2.19 per 1 million output tokens, compared to $60 for GPT-o1. Even OpenAI's mini version of GPT-o1, which is intended to be a lightweight, more affordable version, costs $12. Like DeepSeek, Meta has made open source its central AI strategy with its Llama models, which are currently free. "To people who see the performance of DeepSeek and think, 'China is surpassing the US in AI.' You are reading this wrong," says Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, on Threads. "The correct reading is: 'Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones.'" Meta has set up four war rooms to analyze DeepSeek’s technology, focusing on how the company reduced training costs and what data it may have used, according to The Information. There is some controversy over the chips that power R1. DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, a 40-year-old businessman, reportedly stocked up on Nvidia A100 chips before they were banned from export to China in September 2022. DeepSeek claims R1 runs on lower-capacity Nvidia H800 chips, but it's difficult to know exactly what is going on behind closed doors, especially since A100 chips are still being snuck into China in violation of US sanctions. "Rather than weakening China’s AI capabilities, the sanctions appear to be driving startups like DeepSeek to innovate in ways that prioritize efficiency, resource-pooling, and collaboration," says the MIT Technology Review. The constrained chip supply may have forced the company to place a premium on efficient computing from the start of development. More efficient computing also means less energy use—a welcome innovation given AI's astronomical energy needs. Why has Nvidia's stock price tumbled, even though DeepSeek is still using its chips? Because its AI model does more with less. US tech companies are now coming under fire for a potentially bloated approach to AI development, requiring more and more chips, while being less efficient with them than DeepSeek appears to be. Last week, President Donald Trump announced that Oracle, OpenAI, and Softbank would spearhead a $500 billion investment in AI data centers with the Stargate Project. Data collection is another concern with DeepSeek. Like TikTok, the company is obligated to share user data with the Chinese government if it requests it. The privacy policy lists the data it collects, and how it will use it, including to "comply with our legal obligations." As an open-source platform, that means US companies may feed it their data in addition to everyday chatbot users. I'm the expert at PCMag for all things electric vehicles and AI.

Title: Bitcoin's DeepSeek-Triggered Selloff Is a Buy the Dip Opportunity, Analysts Say

Crypto assets saw a panicky decline overnight alongside a Nvidia-led tech stock plunge on DeepSeek's more efficient artificial intelligence model. With bitcoin (BTC) at one point sliding from a Sunday high of $105,000 to below $98,000 before bouncing back to its current level just below $100,000, some analysts warned this could be the start of an even deeper pullback. Among those taking the other side of that trade is Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered Bank. "Buy the dip," he said in a Monday morning report. Kendrick one week ago warned of a potential 10%-20% correction thanks to markets having priced in overzealous expectations of Trump's crypto executive order and strategic reserve. The overnight selloff, he argued, likely took care of much of this. While there might be some more pain ahead this week with U.S. big tech companies reporting earnings this week and the Federal Reserve's January meeting results Wednesday, Kendrick took note of the rapid decline in U.S. Treasury yields — the 10-year note yield now nearing 4.5% — as signaling much of the downward move is done. Despite there not being much near-term price boost from the Trump administration's digital asset actions, the benefits should ripple through the sector over the next weeks and months through boosted institutional asset flows. LondonCryptoClub analysts hit a similar note, seeing the crypto selloff as a knee-jerk reaction to a headline event. "The Deepseek FUD [fear, uncertainty, doubt] is a classic shoot first, ask questions later," LondonCryptoClub analysts said. "Flushes like these amidst a still constructive fundamental macro story that typically mark local lows in a bull trend." "Be careful today as a broad derisking can be very mechanical and indiscriminate," they added. "But this is very much a BTFD [buy the **** dip] market still." Bitcoin at press time was trading down more than 4% over the past 24 hours at $99,800. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was lower by 3%, led by 15% decline for Nvidia (NVDA).

Title: DeepSeek Surges on App Store: What Is the Chinese AI Model and Why Is It a Big Deal?
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/deepseek-what-is-it-chinese-artificial-intelligence-model/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T16:52:19Z

China’s artificial intelligence company jumped past OpenAI’s ChatGPT on the Apple App Store after releasing two new models DeepSeek sent shock waves through the artificial intelligence world this past weekend and Wall Street on Monday. If you follow the tech industry even sparingly — or happened to jump on X or the App Store recently — you likely saw the name. But what is DeepSeek, and what is the big deal all about? Let’s jump into it. For starters, DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company and research lab that creates open-source large language models, or LLMs. Open-source LLMs are AI models that allow others to build on its technology. X’s Grok and Meta’s Llama are some other well-known open-source LLMs, while OpenAI’s ChatGPT is the most popular closed-source LLM. Why Is It In the News? DeepSeek released its R1 and R1-Zero reasoning models on Jan. 20, and their capabilities quickly gained notice in the tech and AI worlds. In particular, there are two key aspects to DeepSeek’s latest releases: 1) Refined Reinforcement DeepSeek’s model uses a technique called Reinforcement — where a model makes decisions to achieve a certain goal — that goes beyond other models. That is because it does not use human feedback to refine itself, which other models do. As Ben Thompson of the tech-focused Stratechery blog put it succinctly: “LLMs to date, however, have relied on reinforcement learning with human feedback; humans are in the loop to help guide the model, navigate difficult choices where rewards aren’t obvious, etc… R1-Zero, however, drops the HF part — it’s just reinforcement learning.” 2) Distillation Another important factor here is DeepSeek’s distillation technique. Distillation is where a smaller model like DeepSeek is able to lift the information from larger models, while also using less memory and computing power. This also helps cut down on costs. DeepSeek said its recent breakthroughs cost less than $6 million and took less than two months to build. Why Is This a Big Deal? From a macro standpoint, it shows that China — remember, China’s communist government is closely linked to all of its companies, especially the major tech firms that branch out into different markets — is further along in AI innovation than many had thought. And DeepSeek’s performance is particularly noteworthy, given its low cost and its ability to navigate around chip restrictions that were rolled out by former President Joe Biden. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the tech-focused Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, called it AI’s “sputnik moment” on Sunday. Competitors DeepSeek has crashed an already-crowded AI space. It leapfrogged ChatGPT in the Apple App Store as the most-downloaded free app this weekend, indicating there is strong user interest in what DeepSeek can do. Many analysts believe DeepSeek, and what is means about Chinese AI capabilities, was the main reason the U.S. stock market was down on Monday morning, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.72% in the first 90 minutes of trading. Meta, which announced on Friday it would be investing $60 billion-$65 billion to fuel its AI business, was not hit by the Monday drop, with its share price climbing about 1.5% in early trading. Google, which has its own AI model, Gemini, did see its stock price drop about 2.5%, while Tesla was down 1%, although its business is obviously more than just its AI component. Microsoft, OpenAI’s partner, saw its stock price drop 3.7%. The biggest hit was to Nvidia, which supplies chips and other important tech that undergirds AI development. Its stock price was down 14.8% in the first hour and a half of trading on Monday. Censorship? To reinforce that DeepSeek is ultimately beholden to China’s government, many noted this weekend that its model will not answer certain questions on topics the CCP is not a fan of — like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. This is similar to how TheWrap recently found “Little Red Book,” aka “RedNote,” would censor content about Tiananmen Square or China’s treatment of the Uyghurs.

Title: The Nvidia rout sends CEO Jensen Huang's net worth plummeting $18 billion

Nvidia (NVDA+6.73%) CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth plunged $18 billion Monday as the chipmaker’s stock continues to free fall. Huang was worth $106.3 billion as of Monday morning, down nearly 15%, according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Huang has an approximately 3% stake in Nvidia. Shares of Nvidia were down nearly 16% to around $120 apiece just before mid-day. The rout caused the semiconductor giant’s market capitalization to fall by more than $465 billion to $2.97 trillion — the biggest single-day decline in market value for a company, beating its own previous record set last September. That drop puts it below Apple (AAPL+3.94%) and Microsoft (MSFT+2.63%) as the third-most valuable company in the world. Just last week, Nvidia surpassed Apple to become the world’s most valuable company. Global technology stocks suffered a widespread sell-off Monday that sent all three major U.S. indices tumbling, after investors grew concerned over a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML-0.92%), Broadcom (AVGO+0.67%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-3.56%), Micron (MU-2.46%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+3.84%). The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged more than 600 points, or roughly 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, were also down more than 70 points, and the S&P 500 tumbled almost 2%. The sell-off was prompted by DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model rivaling OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+3.08%) Llama 3.1 built using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. In December, the private company launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” However, they noted that the DeepSeek threat isn’t yet cause for concern, as U.S. companies remain ahead of the curve to achieving the next frontier of AI development: artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

Target is the latest national brand to announce plans to roll back long-standing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In a memo to employees, Target announced plans to end its three-year DEI goals and stop reporting to external groups focused on diversity, such as the Human Rights Campaign. The memo noted that Target will no longer support an internal program aimed at carrying more products from Black- and minority-owned businesses. These changes won’t lead to any layoffs, CNBC reported. But it’s already impacting the ways Target is interacting with the community. “Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,” Kiera Fernandez, chief community impact and equity officer at Target, wrote in the memo. “And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future – all in service of driving Target’s growth and winning together.” Target is certainly not alone in its decision-making. Companies such as Tractor Supply, Walmart, Meta and McDonald’s have also scaled back or stopped their DEI commitments amid growing political and societal pressures. Soon after taking office, President Donald Trump ended the government’s DEI programs and placed federal officials in charge of those initiatives on leave. But not all companies are following this trend. For example, Costco recently voted overwhelmingly to continue supporting its DEI programs, with over 98% of shareholders rejecting a proposal to review its DEI risks. Why it matters: This is a moment of sea change as monumental as what we saw when George Floyd was murdered in 2020 and organizations across the country adopted DEI measures as a way of addressing historical inequities in business. To be clear, these changes have been evolving for some time, with a variety of companies slowly scaling back DEI efforts. Then came the Supreme Court decision rolling back affirmative action, which gave some legal cover for halting these programs. Then came societal pressure from activists including Robbie Starbuck. Then, with the election of Donald Trump, the pressures moved from cultural to governmental, with the feds threatening to investigate companies engaging in DEI in ways it deems “illegal.” This is a delicate moment that requires careful balancing. This is not an issue any one department or communicator can tackle. Legal, HR, internal and external communications must all collaborate to determine what is legal, what is just and how those items should be communicated. Target and Costco are one example of companies handling this very differently. Target, which had already been the target of anti-LGBTQ+ protests, retreated from DEI. Costco stood in its principles. Behind each decision, surely, were many agonized conversations, disagreements and lawyers. Your role as a communicator is to be the voice of your audiences. To show the data on their needs and how that may impact the business. This will be a difficult moment regardless of what your organization decides to do. Listen. Advocate in the best interests of the organization and your audiences. That sometimes is the more important role than any official statement.

Title: Trump Can Win Again—Advancing Carbon Capture For 2025

WA Parish plant infrastructure at Fort Bend County. NGR Energy and JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration ... [+] Corporation built the Petra Nova Carbon Capture Project. The project is a commercial-scale carbon capture system that captures carbon dioxide in the processed flue gas from an existing unit at the WA Parish power plant. Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2016, in Houston. ( Marie D. De Jesus / Houston Chronicle ) (Photo by Marie D. De Jesus/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) The first Trump administration had a better record in carbon capture by allowing states to approve permits for carbon dioxide injection wells. There is no reason not to give consumers what they want to buy. The second Trump administration should reverse Biden’s EPA carbon capture policy to guarantee U.S. energy dominance. Polls show that a majority of Americans, including Texans, want a lower emissions future. Carbon capture is a primary tool in the emissions reduction portfolio, and the major oil companies are leading the way by investing billions of dollars in capital and jobs to offset not only their own emissions but their customers’ emissions. The Biden administration did not pursue a forward thinking policy with carbon capture and left office not only with dozens of Class VI carbon dioxide injection well applications still pending but the applications by oil producing states to take over the well permitting task from the federal government. The Biden administration’s attitude was that approving carbon capture projects by oil companies only facilitated further use of fossil fuels. This hostility towards the oil industry was counterproductive and set back efforts to lower emissions by four years. Carbon capture projects are underway in a dozen states. The earliest began in Terrell, Texas, in 1972 with the captured carbon dioxide injected being used for EOR, enhanced oil recovery, and most operating carbon capture projects today are paired with EOR projects. More recent projects reclaim the waste carbon dioxide to produce ethanol for applications in fuels, vodka, hand sanitizers, and perfume. The world is decades away from eliminating fossil fuels. Oil and gas production in Africa is driving economic development there and with it, the reduced mortality rates that will be the largest contributor to an expected global population growth of 2 billion people over the next 30 years. While it is obvious that they will not all drive SUVs, they will have electricity, communications, healthcare, and mass transit. The question now becomes, will the U.S. continue its energy dominance with solutions to the emissions problem? Occidental Petroleum and BlackRock have combined forces to build the world’s largest Direct Air Capture project in Ector County, Texas. The STRATOS project will begin operation later this year. Shell is pursuing carbon capture projects in the U.K., Canada, and in Deer Park, Texas. Chevron is operating carbon sequestration facilities in Australia and California. BP is researching sequestration in Indiana, where Archer Daniels Midlands already operates a Class VI injection well. ExxonMobil operates a 1,500 mile network of CO2 pipelines for EOR, industrial use, and storage—currently 9 million metric tons per year—with a completed well in East Texas and an offshore lease of 270,000 acres in Texas for storage. States are leading the energy transition. In Texas, the installed capacity of wind farms and solar farms is greater than that of natural gas power plants because the state’s elected leaders accommodated the growth. The Texas pipeline of wind and solar projects under construction means that renewable electricity will become the dominant supply in a matter of months. And if the Trump EPA grants primacy to the states for approvals of Class VI carbon injection wells, the states will be able to accommodate the pent-up demand for carbon capture. The Trump administration is a fan of market solutions, and these long-term carbon capture investments are led by domestic and foreign private capital. State and federal support via subsidies and tax breaks are helpful but certainly not the primary catalyst. Complaining about these supports invites comparisons to the oil industry’s tax subsidies and does not contribute to the discussion of advancing a proven solution. It is counter-productive to stand in the way of a demonstrated market with willing buyers and willing sellers already in place. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: What is DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup that shook the tech world? | CNN Business

Time Published: 2025-01-27T15:44:05Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: A surprisingly efficient and powerful Chinese AI model has taken the technology industry by storm. It’s called DeepSeek R1, and it’s rattling nerves on Wall Street. The new AI model was developed by DeepSeek, a startup that was born just a year ago and has somehow managed a breakthrough that famed tech investor Marc Andreessen has called “AI’s Sputnik moment”: R1 can nearly match the capabilities of its far more famous rivals, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, Meta’s Llama and Google’s Gemini — but at a fraction of the cost. The company said it had spent just $5.6 million powering its base AI model, compared with the hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies. That’s even more shocking when considering that the United States has worked for years to restrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. That means DeepSeek was supposedly able to achieve its low-cost model on relatively under-powered AI chips. The company, founded in late 2023 by Chinese hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, is one of scores of startups that have popped up in recent years﻿ seeking big investment to ride the massive AI wave that has taken the tech industry to new heights. Liang has become the Sam Altman of China — an evangelist for AI technology and investment in new research. His hedge fund, High-Flyer, focuses on AI development. Like other AI startups, including Anthropic and Perplexity, DeepSeek released various competitive AI models over the past year that have captured some industry attention. Its V3 model raised some awareness about the company, although its content restrictions around sensitive topics about the Chinese government and its leadership sparked doubts about its viability as an industry competitor, the Wall Street Journal reported. But R1, which came out of nowhere when it was revealed late last year, launched last week and gained significant attention this week when the company revealed to the Journal its shockingly low cost of operation. And it is open-source, which means other companies can test and build upon the model to improve it. The DeepSeek app has surged on the app store charts, surpassing ChatGPT Monday, and it has been downloaded nearly 2 million times. AI is a power-hungry and cost-intensive technology — so much so that America’s most powerful tech leaders are buying up nuclear power companies to provide the necessary electricity for their AI models. Meta last week said it would spend upward of $65 billion this year on AI development. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, last year said the AI industry would need trillions of dollars in investment to support the development of high-in-demand chips needed to power the electricity-hungry data centers that run the sector’s complex models. So the notion that similar capabilities as America’s most powerful AI models can be achieved for such a small fraction of the cost — and on less capable chips — represents a sea change in the industry’s understanding of how much investment is needed in AI. The technology has many skeptics and opponents, but its advocates promise a bright future: AI will advance the global economy into a new era, they argue, making work more efficient and opening up new capabilities across multiple industries that will pave the way for new research and developments. Andreessen, a Trump supporter and co-founder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, called DeepSeek “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” in a post on X. If that potentially world-changing power can be achieved at a significantly reduced cost, it opens up new possibilities — and threats — to the planet. The United States thought it could sanction its way to dominance in a key technology it believes will help bolster its national security. Just a week before leaving office, former President Joe Biden doubled down on export restrictions on AI computer chips to prevent rivals like China from accessing the advanced technology. But DeepSeek has called into question that notion, and threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America’s technology industry. America may have bought itself time with restrictions on chip exports, but its AI lead just shrank dramatically despite those actions. DeepSeek may show that turning off access to a key technology doesn’t necessarily mean the United States will win. That’s an important message to President Donald Trump as he pursues his isolationist “America First” policy. Wall Street was alarmed by the development. US stocks were set for a steep selloff Monday morning. Nvidia (NVDA), the leading supplier of AI chips, whose stock more than doubled in each of the past two years, fell 12% in premarket trading. Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL), Google’s parent company, were also down sharply, as were Marvell, Broadcom, Palantir, Oracle and many other tech giants. The industry is taking the company at its word that the cost was so low. No one is really disputing it, but the market freak-out hinges on the truthfulness of a single and relatively unknown company. The company notably didn’t say how much it cost to train its model, leaving out potentially expensive research and development costs. (Still, it probably didn’t spend billions of dollars.) It’s also far too early to count out American tech innovation and leadership. One achievement, albeit a gobsmacking one, may not be enough to counter years of progress in American AI leadership. And a massive customer shift to a Chinese startup is unlikely. “The DeepSeek model rollout is leading investors to question the lead that US companies have and how much is being spent and whether that spending will lead to profits (or overspending),” said Keith Lerner, analyst at Truist. “Ultimately, our view, is the required spend for data and such in AI will be significant, and US companies remain leaders.” Although the cost-saving achievement may be significant, the R1 model is a ChatGPT competitor — a consumer-focused large-language model. It hasn’t yet proven it can handle some of the massively ambitious AI capabilities for industries that — for now — still require tremendous infrastructure investments. “Thanks to its rich talent and capital base, the US remains the most promising ‘home turf’ from which we expect to see the emergence of the first self-improving AI,” said Giuseppe Sette, president of AI market research firm Reflexivity.

Title: Why Nvidia Stock Is Plummeting Today

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled Monday after the release of a sophisticated artificial intelligence model from a Chinese startup prompted a reckoning on Wall Street regarding AI spending. Chinese company DeepSeek last week released R1, an AI model that appears to rival the capabilities of models from U.S. tech giants like OpenAI and Google despite running on fewer, less powerful chips. U.S. investors began to take notice of the model late last week, and over the weekend started to worry about what it means for richly valued U.S. tech stocks. Nvidia’s earnings and stock price have soared in the past two years as tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) have spent massively on the company's AI systems. DeepSeek has led investors to question whether all that spending was necessary and, if not, why it would continue. Nvidia stock was hammered by Monday’s sell-off. Shares tumbled nearly 17%, its largest one-day drop since the Covid-19 crash in March 2020. Monday’s sell-off wiped about $589 billion from Nvidia’s market cap, the largest loss in history. Wall Street analysts were mostly skeptical about DeepSeek and the sell-off it prompted, though their commentary often reflected uncertainty about the effects DeepSeek could have on the market. Citi analysts expressed doubt that DeepSeek had achieved its results without the most advanced chips. They maintained their "buy" rating on Nvidia stock and said they don't expect major U.S. AI companies to move away from using its advanced GPUs. Jefferies analysts, however, noted DeepSeek's success could press Silicon Valley management to "refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026." Concern about future AI models requiring less computing power weighed on other high-flying AI stocks, including nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), which slumped 28% and 21%, respectively. Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO) also dropped about 17%.

Title: Investors betting on the Trump trade may be missing some real risks

I'm back! Fresh off my trip to Davos I'm jumping right into it. DeepSeek's AI models are spooking tech stocks this morning. The Chinese AI lab has been rolling out new models in recent weeks, and they're cheaper than rival OpenAI's. DeepSeek's models are open-source, which means they're available for anyone who wants to use them for free. That's a challenge to OpenAI, which keeps its top models proprietary, and charges premium prices for them. In a paper released last Monday, DeepSeek unveiled a new flagship AI model called R1 that shows off a new level of "reasoning" — and it has left much of America's top industry researchers stunned. DeepSeek hit No. 1 on the Apple App Store's Top Free Apps Chart days later. It's the latest disruption in AI, and markets are feeling the shock, with Nvidia down by more than 10% premarket on Monday. Meanwhile, in today's newsletter, we're focusing on investors' exuberance over the new administration has some wondering if people are getting ahead of themselves. What's on deck Markets: Multistrat hedge funds just can't quit Manhattan. Tech: VC Twitter has found a new love — LinkedIn. Business: Breakfast isn't getting cheaper anytime soon thanks to the price of eggs. But first, hot out the gates. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. There are plenty of uncertainties with the new administration. How investors feel about Donald Trump's pro-business agenda isn't one of them. Stocks reached record highs during the president's first week in office, and there's plenty of hope that it's just the beginning. Trump's consistent message of deregulation and lower corporate taxes has investors excited about the resulting growth potential. Some in the market, however, aren't as convinced. Business Insider's Jennifer Sor has a story on how investors might be wearing Trump-tinted glasses that are hiding some real risks. Much of the concern stems from persistently high interest rates, worries that were pushed aside last week as investors focused on Trump's pro-growth agenda. And while the aggressiveness of Trump's tariff policy remains unclear, many believe it will eventually push inflation higher, further dampening views of stimulative rate cuts. While the market has elected to look past elevated rates, the ever-important 10-year Treasury yield crept up as much as 13 basis points during the four-day week. The US market has the benefit of somewhat being the only game in town, though. European economies are in a much weaker position than the US, which dents the future earnings potential of companies there. And the threat of more regulation makes them even less inviting. China's economy, meanwhile, is struggling to mount a comeback. It's also one of Trump's biggest foreign targets. And while there's always a chance of reconciliation, that's a risky bet. Still, the US stock market is heavily concentrated in mega-cap tech names, which some see as a looming risk. Albert Edwards, a famously bearish strategist, shared three charts that illustrate how top-heavy things are, writes BI's Will Edwards. But investors seem willing to keep betting on the US. Meanwhile, with only one term to implement his plan, Trump has no time to waste. That means businesses (and the people investing in them) will just need to prepare for a bit of a bumpy ride. BI's John L. Dorman, Brent D. Griffiths, and Bryan Metzger have a breakdown of all the shockwaves Trump has already sent through corporate America during his first week. Trump and Musk are at odds again. This time over the UK prime minister. 1. New York City is still the center of the hedge fund universe. Despite interest in sunnier places like Miami, regulatory filings reveal most portfolio managers at multistrategy hedge funds work from the Big Apple. That includes funds like Balyasny, Citadel, and Point72, which are headquartered elsewhere. 2. Inside the routine and leadership style of a Citadel partner. Micah Nance runs a team of nine analysts and associates that covers about 150 tech and media companies out of the hedge fund's Dallas office. He spoke to BI about his 13 years climbing the ranks at the high-profile firm, how he manages his time, and some career advice. 3. Here come the crypto hires. The market and regulators are both getting behind digital assets again. As a result, both fintechs and traditional finance firms are staffing up. 1. The Zuckermoon is over. The Meta CEO was on the precipice of becoming cool after his major makeover and "wife guy" revamp. But he's lost brownie points with some since dealing blows to Meta's fact-checking system, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. The comments section — and even AI's opinion — is ruthless. 2. The buzz around voice AI. The tech isn't new, but investors are excited about its vast use cases and recent rapid sophistication. BI spoke to investors about the untapped opportunities they see in the sector, from real-time audio transcriptions to generating synthetic voices. 3. VC Twitter takes LinkedIn. Though X remains the platform of choice for venture capitalists, they're starting to post more on LinkedIn. VCs told BI they see better "ROI" on their posts on the workplace social-networking site, and that it's where business can actually get done. 1. Cheap eggs aren't on the horizon. Bird flu isn't going anywhere, and it's limiting supply. Meanwhile, a surge in consumer "egg-citement" is driving demand. A push to treat chickens better isn't cheap, either — and it's all reflected in the current egg prices. 2. Eli Lilly's weight-loss wonders. The Mounjaro and Zepbound producer hopes to close the gap with competitor Novo Nordisk's Ozempic — and take things a step further. Eli Lilly's head of obesity teased a pill to rival Ozempic and a triple-threat "King Kong" injection to mimic bariatric surgery. The ultimate dream: a once-per-year weight-loss shot. 3. Gen Z is already fed up with work — and it's not about laziness. Less than a third of young American workers felt engaged at their job last year, a report from Gallup found. The younger generation hasn't wasted time taking a transactional view of work, BI's Aki Ito wrote. However, with low engagement costing businesses $9 trillion a year worldwide, employers need to step it up. I'm the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company. These seven lessons have shaped my success.

The Lost Head and the Bird (Sohrab Hura, 2018). “We are excited to announce insulin is free now.” At first glance, this November 2022 Twitter post from @EliLillyandCo appeared to be a legitimate announcement from the pharmaceutical company; the account’s profile featured an icon of Eli Lilly and Company’s logo and a blue check mark that, until the previous day, signified the account had been formally verified by the platform’s dedicated staff. But in the hands of new owner Elon Musk, who completed his acquisition of the platform two weeks earlier, Twitter’s verification process underwent significant modification. Suddenly, verification was available to anyone with an authenticated phone number and a willingness to pay $8 a month for the platform’s Premium plan. Twitter, soon to be rebranded as X, inevitably descended into chaos, rife with impersonators and misinformation. Eli Lilly’s stock share price fell by 4.37 percent in one day. What, above all, this episode seemed to signal was the breakdown of institutional responsibility. Prioritizing revenue over accountability, Twitter abandoned any pretense that it would be an arbiter of authenticity; Meta recently followed suit, announcing on January 7 of this year that it would be ditching its fact-checkers in favor of a crowdsourced system of community notes. In our era of “post-truth” politics, images and videos have become laden with new economies of meaning, not all of them based in fact. Social media platforms, as we have seen time and time again, are not neutral mediators but actively influence the reception of content—whether by amplifying certain narratives through algorithmic promotion, stripping or adding context via content labels, or allowing virality to determine credibility. You’ll find a similar line of interest in the crisp, hyper-saturated pictures of the Indian photographer and filmmaker Sohrab Hura, whose recent projects take up a study of synthetic images and how they are distributed. He began working this way as a direct response to the 2004 Indian election, in which the Bharatiya Janata Party’s ultranationalism and “India Shining” slogan aimed to project an image of an economically strong and empowered country—one far from the reality lived by many Indians, especially those in rural areas. Returning to power in 2014 with Narendra Modi as prime minister, the BJP undertook an even more aggressive campaign of propaganda and distortion. V. K. Singh, a cabinet minister, has referred to journalists as “presstitutes.” Modi claims to have once worked as a humble tea seller on a railway platform, though a 2015 Right to Information query cast doubt on his story. Campaign video for Manoj Tiwari, a BJP candidate for parliament, appears to show him speaking English and Haryanvi, the latter a direct appeal to Delhi’s large population of migrant workers. When it was revealed that the original speech was in Hindi, and that the other versions were AI-assisted deepfakes, the BJP dismissed the episode as an experiment. Sohrab Hura, Remains of the day, 2024. Soft pastel on paper. Courtesy of the artist and Experimenter, Kolkata and Mumbai. Surreal times call for surrealist art. Mother, now on view at MoMA PS1 in New York, is the first US survey of Hura’s work. It orchestrates a kaleidoscope of images and sounds, plunging viewers into a maelstrom of ambiguity where truth is indistinguishable from fiction. Single-channel videos flash and whir, suffused with a palpable anxiety. His lurid pastel illustrations and paintings in gouache and acrylics show some fidelity to photography, composed like snapshots or selfies. Together, these varied forms of practice seem to ask if some mediums are more inclined to capture reality than others. In Mother, we find not just Hura’s inquiry into the self, but into his motherland. Things Felt but Not Quite Expressed, a collection of Hura’s illustrations with sardonically self-referential titles, was created between 2022 and 2024, when he was experiencing a disconnect from the fixed nature of photography, moving from image to illustration to capture the idiosyncrasies of quotidian life in an increasingly polarized world. A meme of a French bulldog captioned “Men over 35 in skinny jeans”; impressionistic lashings of bright color; a portrait of a refugee Palestinian couple lying idly in a Syrian field—the art of Things Felt is by turns dreamy, hilarious, and deeply moving. It also speaks to Hura’s recent efforts to consolidate emotional truth into his images. Photographic glitches allow Hura to explore the manipulation and distortion of meaning in a world increasingly dominated by algorithm-driven images. A glitch could be as simple as the warping of a scanned photo, or the telltale signs of some crude Photoshopping. (Think of the hysteria that Princess Catherine’s doctored Mother’s Day photo caused earlier this year and the very meme-able apology that followed: “Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing.”) Hura views these glitches as “fault lines of doubt,” spaces that allow new layers of understanding to emerge.1 They “have this ability to give us a sense of the real in an increasingly fake world," he explains, pointing to the onslaught of edited images we are exposed to daily.2 As AI and algorithms generate more viral content, he believes the future of photography and film lies in these mistakes and accidents, indissoluble from human nature. The Lost Head and the Bird (Sohrab Hura, 2018). Hura works to draw out that fluidity in his films, too. In The Lost Head and the Bird (2018), the artist induces sensory overload through a rapid-fire montage of found footage—images of Bollywood stars, right-wing propaganda, and bloody violence—all interleaved with Hura’s own photographs. The intensity of this visual barrage is amplified by a frenetic soundtrack by Hannes d’Hoine and Sjoerd Bruil, which disrupts our ability to accurately interpret what we see. The film takes its name from the surreal one-page story and photo series published in Hura’s book The Coast (2019), which introduces Madhu, a pitiful woman whose head was stolen by a jealous ex-lover as her pet bird escaped its cage. In the film, a fortune teller sells Madhu a crow, having convinced her that it’s a parrot with a bad cough. The final character in the story, Hura explains, is himself: the photographer, complicit in this violence and deception. In implicating himself, he also implicates the viewer in this voyeurism, claiming that “both of us are helping circulate these images,” blurring the lines between participant and observer.3 Watching The Lost Head is a borderline hallucinatory experience. An iteration of the project for MoMA in 2021 featured twelve versions of the film accompanied by unnerving short stories, each a slight variation of the one that came before. By subtly changing our understanding of Madhu in each retelling, Hura plays with our instinct to trust photographic images and escalates the viewer’s confusion. Confounding any notion of objectivity, he evinces how meaning can be warped not just by manipulating images but also through the sequencing of information. The Coast (Sohrab Hura, 2020). Using footage and stills taken after religious celebrations in a coastal village in Tamil Nadu, The Coast (2020) retains this slightly surreal quality, though its narrative is far more tightly controlled. The project began as a photobook in 2018, and the film develops the original concept by embracing a plurality of forms, using the margin between land and water as a point of release to explore the undercurrents of religious, sexual, and caste-related violence along India’s coastline. The intimate footage transitions from sacred communal fervor to quiet, unsettling moments of post-festival reflection, in which bodies and spaces take on an otherworldly quality. Once again, Hura manipulates context by covertly adding and removing details to blur lines between reality and artifice; his harsh, unforgiving flash creates visuals that mirror the fragmented, fetishistic language of social media images. In The Coast, this litany is brought to life by shots of India’s shoreline, deployed throughout Hura’s work as a metaphor for a society on the brink of collapse. But here, the sea also manifests as a site of religious ritual as demonic masquerades, bloodletting, scenes of destitution, deformity, and anguish unfold. At first, the lapping waves seethe with libidinal energy, then the film gradually transitions to more serene images of darkened figures diving into the ocean, submitting to its primal force. This climactic moment, when the sea collides with grainy, ecstatic bodies, offers them release from artifice in their heightened psychospiritual state. As Hura puts it, “nothing is definite, everything is raw and overwhelming.” While The Lost Head islaced with references to Ganesha, The Coast affects allusions to religion more literally as festivalgoers masquerade as different deities, entering a trancelike frenzy as their bodies hit the water, which washes away their face paint. Hura explains that in India, “perhaps more so than anywhere else, fiction, stories … live longer than factual stories. They are allegories that people return to, constants in the ongoing turbulence of politics, religion, and caste.”4 This idea of enduring allegories seems especially pertinent in a time when religious narratives are increasingly distorted and weaponized. The BJP, for example, has made incendiary anti-Muslim rhetoric integral to its political strategy. During the 2024 election, the party explicitly framed themselves as defenders of Hindu interests, portraying Muslims as an external threat. In May 2024, civil and corporate watchdog groups submitted fake advertisements to Meta as a test of their filtering mechanisms: one proclaimed that “Hindu blood is spilling, these invaders must be burned,” while another called for the execution of a rival political leader. Both were approved to appear on Facebook and Instagram. Pati (Sohrab Hura, 2010). Given Hura’s deliberate shift away from aesthetic objectivity in recent years, it’s interesting that his earlier work is marked by an earnest confidence in film’s potential for truth-telling. His first film, Pati (2010), is an eleven-minute black-and-white documentary featuring barren landscapes—the aftermath of deforestation and deprivation—in the village of Pati, Madhya Pradesh. Collating photos taken in 2005, the projectchronicles the final push from activists, students, academics, journalists, and artists campaigning for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act: a landmark bill that, once implemented, guaranteed 100 days per year of minimum-wage employment for all adult members of a rural household. One particularly moving scene shows children working at a construction site. “Life is not the easiest for [them],” says Hura in voice-over. “There is no respite for anyone over here, and any hand is a helping hand, no matter how small it is.” Pati’s framing of children’s resilience here shares an edifying quality with Francis Alÿs’s Children’s Games video series (1999–), which also looks to make sense of injustice through the eyes of the innocent. While Alÿs films with an anthropological closeness, Hura instead draws attention to his role as the “idiot photographer”: a spectator all too aware of his role in the complicity and cruelty required to make such images.5 Yet his self-awareness doesn’t necessarily absolve him; by foregrounding his own position, Hura risks turning ethical scrutiny into an aesthetic device, one that allows the film to acknowledge its own voyeurism without disrupting it. In this way, Pati becomes complicit in the very structures of image-making it seeks to expose. Bittersweet (Sohrab Hura, 2019). In an earlier short, Bittersweet (2019), Hura initially resisted this impulse to question the ethical place of the photographer. Documenting Hura’s life over ten years, the film focuses on his mother—diagnosed with acute paranoid schizophrenia when he was seventeen—and her relationship with her dog, Elsa. Here, his discomfort was more personal, shaped by his dual role as both son and photographer. Looking back on the film in 2019, he explained his early reluctance to share this work: I didn’t want to feel vulnerable. I didn’t want others to look at her in pity or shock. At the time I had thought that I was being protective of her, but I soon realized that I was actually being protective of myself. How they might have looked at my mother would also define how they looked at me and that scared me. But how could I continue to parachute into someone else’s life and photograph another mother when I couldn’t photograph my own? I had started to feel sure that I needed to turn the camera on myself. I felt that I needed to earn my right to photograph someone else’s life by first putting my own out there with nothing held back.6 In that sense, Bittersweet functions like an eerie family album: grainy, overexposed photos overlaid with discordant sounds, produced by transforming light exposure readings of the scanned photos into sound frequencies. Like synaptic connections, the images weave together fragments of his mother’s fractured reality, allowing the viewer the impression of witnessing a schizophrenic episode through intrusive snapshots. Sometimes she smokes, looking melancholic; sometimes she lies in bed, smiling with Elsa. While Bittersweet remains Hura’s most personal—certainly his most vulnerable—work to date, it represents a significant shift in his engagement with reality. As he questions the boundaries between personal exposure and public consumption, Hura moves beyond mere documentation, instead drawing the viewer into his intimate, subjective experience and the complex social processes through which images are consumed and interpreted. Today, Hura's work takes on a new urgency. Meta plans to populate its platforms with AI-generated users; there has been a surge in harassment, hate speech, and misinformation since Musk’s takeover of X. (And that’s without accounting for the platform’s role in aiding Trump secure the US Presidency, or Musk’s attempts to wade into British politics.) None of this is new thematic territory for Hura, though, who has spoken about the political ramifications of digitally altered images for years. “With algorithms and AI now making most of these viral videos and images—and this is only going to get more prolific and perverse—I feel the future of photography lies in its glitches,” he observes. “As photographers, we will make mistakes, and accidents will happen, and these will help us remember that we are still human.”7 Hura’s art toys with the manipulability of images and their contexts, challenging viewers to chart the hidden codes and meanings embedded within them. In his films, we find a madness that asks us to suspend our belief while drawing us in deeper: we find a world in disarray, much like our own. Don't miss our latest features and interviews.

Title: Why DeepSeek Is Sinking Nvidia Stock?

HANGZHOU, CHINA - JANUARY 27, 2025 - A Illustration photo shows DeepSeek and Nvidia LOGO in Hangzhou ... [+] City, Zhejiang Province, China, January 27, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) A few weeks ago, Chinese AI research lab DeepSeek released its open-source AI model, DeepSeek-R1, which has drawn significant attention in the tech world. According to a paper authored by the lab, the DeepSeek-R1 model outperforms cutting-edge models such as OpenAI’s o1 and Meta’s Llama AI models across multiple benchmarks. This is impressive, given that the model is also open-source, cost-effective, and requires significantly less computational power compared to its rivals. Now DeepSeek’s approach appears to have set off alarm bells in Silicon Valley, where most big tech giants have been relying more on brute force — amassing a larger stock of GPU chips and servers and running long model training periods. We believe this development could potentially have implications for Nvidia stock, the dominant player in the AI hardware space. Also, check out our analysis on: How Nvidia stock could drop 50%. DeepSeek has reportedly restructured the foundation of AI models, emphasizing software-driven resource optimization over hardware dependency. Although the company apparently utilizes tens of thousands of Nvidia’s H100 and H200 AI GPUs to train its models, it has faced constraints due to U.S. export controls limiting access to the latest chips. To overcome this, DeepSeek has implemented innovative engineering tweaks, such as custom communication schemes between chips to improve data transfer efficiency, memory-saving techniques, and reinforcement learning methods to minimize computational power requirements. These optimizations result in drastically lower costs compared to traditional large language models. Separately, up 45% in a week? See: What’s Happening With Tempus AI (TEM) Stock? This cost efficiency is reflected in the API pricing for DeepSeek-R1, which costs just $0.55 per million input tokens and $2.19 per million output tokens — significantly undercutting OpenAI’s API rates of $15 and $60, respectively. However, it remains unclear how quickly DeepSeek can expand its reach. The company’s commercial ambitions could face challenges due to the U.S. chip ban. More importantly, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China could create trust issues for companies considering using Chinese-built large language models. These factors could limit DeepSeek’s penetration in Western markets. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. That being said, we believe that DeepSeek’s advancements could prompt a moment of reckoning for big tech companies. DeepSeek’s resource-efficient methods could force a reconsideration of brute-force AI strategies that rely on massive investments in computing power. Nvidia has been the largest beneficiary of this approach through the AI boom, with its GPUs regarded as the best performing for training and deploying AI models. Over the past two years, companies have funneled massive resources into building AI models, driving Nvidia’s revenue up by over 125% in fiscal year 2024 to $61 billion, with net margins nearing 50%. If the industry begins to take inspiration from the methods DeepSeek uses in its open-source models, we could very well see demand for AI Computing power cool off. The underlying economics of the broader AI ecosystem have been weak in the first place, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments. This could accelerate the shift toward more cost-effective, resource-optimized AI models. Now the increase in NVDA stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We see a possibility that the “fear-of-missing-out” driven AI wave seen over the last two years could ease off due to diminishing incremental performance gains from larger models and also as the availability of high-quality training data becomes a bottleneck. This shift toward more efficient models could compound the impact of a potential slowdown for GPU makers such as Nvidia. Moreover, Nvidia also faces mounting competition from the likes of AMD as well as its own customers such as Amazon, who have been focusing on developing and deploying their own AI chips. While Nvidia does have a comprehensive software ecosystem around its AI processors, including programming languages that should help it better lock customers into its products, the company could face pressure.

Title: U.S. Retail Sales Projected to Increase by 4% in 2025, Reaching $5.2 Trillion Amid Economic Challenges

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Bain & Co. report details strategic resolutions for retailers, while also highlighting growth in non-store sales. Executive Editor According to a research report from the retail team at Bain & Co., nominal U.S. retail sales are pegged to see a 4 percent increase, year-over-year, in 2025 — “barring major macroeconomic or geopolitical shocks,” the firm noted. The report also included “resolutions” that successful retailers are focusing on this year. “That equates to around $5.2 trillion in estimated total sales in 2025,” the authors of the report said. “It’s a strong outlook, given a stagnant consumer outlook, tempering inflation, negative [year-over-year] employment trends, diminishing consumer savings, rising credit card delinquencies, elevated nondiscretionary costs and potential trade disruptions.” Related Articles Beauty Features EXCLUSIVE: Milk Makeup Is Launching at Ulta Beauty Furniture Salone del Mobile.Milano Planning Saudi Edition as Italian Design Firms Expand Retail Footprint The Bain advisers said they expect growth will be fueled by a 10 percent increase in non-store sales, “while in-store sales will see modest 2 percent gains, led by general merchandise, apparel, and health and personal care stores.” You May Also Like The report was written and compiled by Bain partners Aaron Cheris, Kurt Grichel, Marc-André Kamel and Darrell Rigby as well as Stephanie Koszyk, practice director. “Retailers face a pivotal moment in 2025,” the report’s authors said. “The challenges of shifting consumer behaviors and demands, economic volatility, regulatory changes and trade complexities persist, reshaping the retail game. Successful businesses will go beyond the familiar, tapping into cutting-edge technologies, reimagining loyalty programs and fortifying supply chains against an unpredictable global backdrop.” The report said that while headwinds remain, “opportunities such as potential interest rate cuts, tax incentives and momentum from a strong 2024 holiday season suggest 2025 may be a year in which innovative moves can set the stage for lasting success.” Regarding resolutions for success, the Bain report said companies should take cues from “scale players” such as Walmart and Amazon (with large assortments, along with Costco). The report’s authors said these brands “have become the go-to for many shoppers, accounting for 57 percent of retail growth over the last three quarters and 17 percent of total U.S. retail sales in 2024 — a 6-percentage-point increase from 2014.” The firm said competing directly with these giants is harder than ever. “But by crafting a unique value proposition, retailers can carve out a winning position alongside them and capture significant rewards.” Bain said a clear and compelling value proposition starts “with the fundamentals, be it fast shipping, consistent quality or reliable digital experiences. Miss here, and irrelevance is almost inevitable.” The fundamentals include having balanced assortments that cater to customer preferences, which can boost sales by 2 to 5 percent. “Private brands are becoming an especially powerful tool, adding value through exclusivity,” Bain said noting that the firm’s research shows high-performing private brands can boost grocer share of wallet by 12 percentage points. Pricing and promotions will also be a key to success. “Strong value perception doesn’t always mean chasing the lowest price,” the report stated. “Retailers with a competitive advantage build structured pricing architectures that align with their customer and product strategies, balancing margin growth and market share. Personalized promotions tailored to individual preferences can further enhance value perception and influence buying behavior — ultimately improving ROI.” With the supply chain, Bain recommends diversifying supplier sourcing, which involves retailers adopting “right-shoring strategies” to optimize operations balancing cost, resilience and speed. The firm said the focus is not on shifting entirely to one region, but creating a flexible system capable of addressing priorities such as response times, market proximity, or resource access during volatility. Bain said its research showed that about 70 percent of retailers said they intend to augment onshoring or nearshoring in the next three years, with many U.S. companies lessening dependence on China in favor of regions such as India or North America. For example, Steve Madden plans to cut imports from China by 40 percent to 45 percent next year by establishing alternative production and sourcing in different countries. The footwear brand was one of the first to act in response to an announcement of possible tariffs on China from the administration of President Donald Trump.The report’s authors said optimizing networks with “digital twins” can also mitigate sourcing challenges. Digital twin platforms are virtual models that use real-time data to test the impact of different variables. Retailers are adopting these platforms to simulate disruptive scenarios such as weather or labor shortages, allowing for quick network adjustments and long-term strategic planning. Integrated with real-time tracking for comprehensive visibility, digital twins help pinpoint vulnerabilities, enhance processes and strengthen supply chains.In addition, predictive analytics are increasingly used for smarter inventory management, enabling retailers to anticipate demand shifts and optimize stock levels effectively. “Amid fast-changing consumer preferences and frequent disruptions, precise forecasting is crucial,” the report’s authors said. “AI-powered tools can help analyze demand in real-time, allowing retailers to dynamically adjust inventory placement to reduce transit times, lower costs and prevent costly stockouts or excess inventory. Bain’s experience shows custom AI forecasting models can cut excess inventory by 40 percent and boost accuracy by nearly 50 percent compared to manual planning.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

UK fibre broadband altnet Zzoomm, which last September ​​hired advisors to help it find potential merger partners in a bid to gain scale, has struck an M&A deal with fellow altnet FullFibre. The combined company will have a network that reaches 600,000 UK properties, more than 65,000 paying customers, and will “be well positioned for further M&A,” according to this announcement from FullFibre, which has previously expanded as a result of a merger with another fibre network builder, Digital Infrastructure. Financial details of the deal were not shared. Zzoomm’s CEO, Matthew Hare, will become executive chairman of the combined company, while James Warner, currently CEO of FullFibre, will be group CEO. “The merged entity combines two complementary networks and operating models,” noted FullFibre. “This will create significant opportunities to accelerate customer growth across a larger footprint, secure funding for new builds and future mergers, and achieve greater operational and financial efficiencies through economies of scale,” it added. The deal is subject to “final documentation execution and regulatory approval” but this is expected in the next few months. Zzoomm’s Hare noted: “We have consistently stated our strategy is to grow organically and by M&A in this fragmented market. [As] an enlarged business with the operational and financial infrastructure, benefitting from the economies of scale, as well as a management team with an exceptional track record, we will have an excellent platform to combine with other altnets in the near future as well as driving organic growth faster.” FullFibre’s Warner added: “With a shared commitment to delivering transformational full fibre connectivity with exceptional customer experience, this deal strengthens our collective ability to grow even faster and seize new market opportunities. For FullFibre, this is our second merger and another milestone in our mission to create a 21st-century digital backbone for the nation. Following our recent successful integration with Digital Infrastructure and BeFibre, this next merger further accelerates our ambitions to lead the market and provide unmatched connectivity to homes, businesses, and wholesale partners alike.” In what looks like a response to the Stargate Project AI infrastructure plans announced last week by OpenAI, SoftBank and others, Meta’s chairman, CEO and majority owner Mark Zuckerberg, has taken to his company’s Threads social media platform to announce a significant increase in infrastructure investment this year and plans for a datacentre that with processing capacity of more than 2 gigawatts “is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan”. In this Threads post, Zuckerberg stated that Meta will “bring online [about] 1 gigawatt of compute” and “end the year with more than 1.3 million GPUs. We’re planning to invest $60 to $65bn in capex this year while also growing our AI teams significantly, and we have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead. This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership.” Forbes noted that the capex figure is way above the $51bn expected by Wall Street analysts and a giant leap up from the projected 2024 full year capex of $38.4bn. Meanwhile, reports continue to emerge of how Stargate’s backers intend to fund the giant project. OpenAI and SoftBank are believed to be pumping an initial $19bn each into the planned deployments, leaving the stakeholders some way short of the $100bn they stated was ready to be deployed with immediate effect. In addition, Nikkei Asia reported that Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank (which is responsible for Stargate’s funding strategy), is to approach investment firms Apollo Global Management and Brookfield about funding the initiative’s AI datacentres. While that saga continues, India’s Reliance Industries is keen to play a role in the global race to build staggering volumes of datacentre capacity. According to Bloomberg, Reliance plans to build the world’s largest AI datacentre in Jamnagar with a capacity of 3 gigawatts, a move that will cost up to $30bn. According to Bloomberg, the world’s largest datacentre currently is a 600 megawatts site in Virginia, US. Reliance is one of a number of Indian tech giants (along with Tata Communications and Tech Mahindra) that have already developed relationships with AI chip giant Nvidia, which noted during its AI Summit event in Mumbai last October that Reliance is working with Nvidia to build “AI factories to automate industrial tasks and transform processes in sectors like energy and manufacturing”. But all of these plans might be subject to revision, in one way or another, as the AI world takes stock of the potential impact of DeepSeek, an open-source, generative AI (GenAI) platform from China that appears to match the capabilities of existing GenAI apps, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, while reportedly running on far more cost-effective compute infrastructure. The DeepSeek app was launched last week and is already top of the Apple App Store’s ranking of free apps, one ahead of ChatGPT. DeepSeek’s capabilities and its ability to match other apps while running on less advanced chips than its US rivals sent to stock markets into panic mode, reported Bloomberg, with Nvidia’s share price slumping by almost 13% to $124.47 in early trading on the Nasdaq exchange on Monday. As a result of that decline, Nvidia’s market value is only just above $3tn (so it’s not in any danger of collapse…). While the launch of new AI apps and models is only going to continue, and potentially cause ructions in the AI tech world, all of these developments spell good news for the telecom sector. All that data traffic needs to be shunted from A to B across data networks, and while the hyperscalers have some of their own network infrastructure, they, as well as the world’s enterprises, will need to rely on data network operators to underpin their operations, which is the exact point Verizon made when it launched its AI Connect strategy at the end of last week. Having recently reached a binding agreement to form a fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) joint venture, two of Spain’s main telcos, MásOrange and Vodafone Spain (now owned by Zegona Communications), are reportedly in talks to form a mobile network joint venture that would combine their radio access network assets, reports Expansion. Any resulting company would then seek to sell a stake to an external investor, which is the same model the operators are deploying with their FTTP venture. UK broadband network operator TalkTalk is investigating a potential data breach after a hacker offered access to the details of 19 million current and former customers, according to The Register. – The staff, TelecomTV Jan 28, 2025 Jan 28, 2025 Jan 28, 2025 Jan 27, 2025 Jan 24, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 7:06:30 AM PST by Red Badger Stocks were down sharply on Monday on concern about an artificial intelligence stock bubble popping because of the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek that possibly made a competitive AI model for a fraction of the cost. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 122 points, or 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite shed 2.7%, and the S&P 500 slid 1.6%. Last week, DeepSeek released an open source AI model that reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s in several tests. The company had launched an open source large-language model in December for what it says was less than $6 million. While Wall Street questions that figure, the foreign startup is still raising concern that the billions being spent to build out big AI models could be done for much more cheaply. “Why are investors concerned? The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in ’25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande. “Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek’s highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” AI darling Nvidia dropped 11%, Broadcom lost 12%, and AMD shed 4%. Microsoft lost 4%. Palantir was also hit for 4%. Other megacap tech names Amazon and Meta Platforms respectively shed 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively. Derivative plays from the AI buildout like power providers were also hit big. Constellation Energy lost 17%, while Vistra dropped 20%. Monday’s sharp declines come as traders brace for a major week, with “Magnificent Seven” members Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple all due to report their latest quarterly results. On top of that, the Federal Reserve will hold its first policy meeting of the year, deciding on the level of interest rates on Wednesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that the central bank leaves interest rates unchanged, according to CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool. All three major U.S. indexes recorded their second-straight positive week last week, reassuring investors that the bull market remains intact even after December’s dip. The S&P 500 hit a new intraday record on Friday after notching a fresh all-time closing high in the previous session. 6 Min Ago VIX ‘fear index’ leaps 45% Monday morning as risk-off trades grip stocks The CBOE Market Volatility Index, known on Wall Street as the VIX, soared more than 45% early Monday to 21.56 — up from just 14.85 on Friday, according to FactSet data. The VIX briefly rose as high as 22.51 on Monday. The VIX is a measure of how much investors expect the S&P 500 will move over the next 30 days, and is often considered a byword for how much fear there is in the stock market and where current sentiment stands. The 52-week high of 38.57in the VIX came during last August’s risk-off unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades when the Bank of Japan raised rates, the dollar weakened and it briefly looked as though U.S. unemployment was picking up. — Scott Schnipper TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Hey!

The VIX briefly rose as high as 22.51 on Monday. The VIX is a measure of how much investors expect the S&P 500 will move over the next 30 days, and is often considered a byword for how much fear there is in the stock market and where current sentiment stands. The 52-week high of 38.57in the VIX came during last August’s risk-off unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades when the Bank of Japan raised rates, the dollar weakened and it briefly looked as though U.S. unemployment was picking up. — Scott Schnipper TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Hey!

Title: How Ciena keeps the internet online, with CEO Gary Smith

One of the biggest tech companies you’ve never heard of is helping you listen to this podcast. by Nilay Patel One of the biggest tech companies you’ve never heard of is helping you listen to this podcast. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Gary Smith, CEO of the networking company Ciena. You probably aren’t familiar with Ciena — the company isn’t really a household name. But every internet user has relied on the company’s products; in fact, every internet user has used its products. Ciena makes the hardware and software that make the fiber optic cables that connect the world light up with data. That’s everything from local fiber networks for broadband ISPs to the massive undersea cables that connect continents. There’s a high probability that this very podcast came to you over a Ciena-powered network, in fact — this company is everywhere. Gary himself is a fascinating character in this story. He joined Ciena in 1997, the year the company had an astonishingly successful IPO in the middle of the dotcom boom. And he became its CEO in 2001, right after the dotcom crash sent the company’s stock price — and the rest of the economy — into a tailspin. So Gary has had a front-row seat to the development of the internet as we know it, and Ciena has been there every step of the way — as telecoms and undersea cables first brought the planet online, all the way to the rise of cloud computing and, now, generative AI. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! You’re going to hear Gary and I talk a lot about something called WDM, or Wavelength Division Multiplexing, which is the fundamental technical innovation Ciena is built around. WDM is absolutely key to how the modern internet works, and most people have no idea it exists. The basic idea is that WDM uses multiple wavelengths of light to fit more data onto a single fiber optic cable, which allows those cables to deliver more and more information over time — you’ll hear Gary call it “virtualizing” a fiber optic cable, like you’re turning a single cable into two, or five, or 10. This is obviously hugely important as the world’s internet usage increases and data-hungry applications like streaming video and generative AI ramp up. Ciena didn’t invent WDM, but it was the first company to deploy it commercially in the ’90s — and I wanted to know how Gary was managing his investment in pushing that technology forward and whether he was thinking about the next kind of tech that might disrupt it. I also wanted to know about Ciena’s customers. There are only so many companies building deep sea cables and giant data centers, and it won’t surprise you that the customer set has largely shifted from telecom providers and ISPs to giant cloud computing companies like Meta and Google and Microsoft over the past few years. Just a few months ago, Meta announced it would pay $10 billion to build its own exclusive subsea cable stretching nearly 25,000 miles. Ciena sits right in the middle of that complicated relationship between industry and infrastructure, and I think you’ll find Gary’s perspective to be pretty unique. We also got into the fracturing state of the internet and what it means that people in different geographic locations, dependent on various levels of government control, experience the online world differently. Connecting cables stretching across continents means the people on either end of those cables might have very different ideas about the internet, and Ciena has to take all of that into account. See, I’m guessing you didn’t know about Ciena before, but almost every single Decoder idea is right here, sitting on the backbone of the internet. Okay, Ciena CEO Gary Smith. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Gary Smith, you’re the CEO of Ciena. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you. Good to be here. I am very excited to talk to you. The Decoder team and I were talking earlier about how we love stories of hidden companies that run the world, and Ciena very much feels like one of those companies. It is a huge player in networking. It’s a huge player in the future of our networks. There’s some AI to talk about. There’s undersea cables to talk about, which is always fun. Quickly, for everyone, describe what Ciena is and what you do. Basically, Ciena is the leading technology company in the world for providing high-speed connectivity. So if you think about all the networks that have been enabled around the internet and around the world, or, as you alluded to, submarine cables, Ciena is really the driving force behind that high-speed technology. Even with mobile connectivity, terrestrial connectivity, and submarine cable connectivity, we’re basically the best in the world at moving optical bits. I always think about it as two internets, right? There’s the internet we experience — the digital internet — and then there’s the physical internet: the actual cables and wires that connect our networks together and connect us together. That is Ciena’s business, running these cables, figuring out how to move data across them more quickly, and figuring out how to move more data across them. Ciena’s been around for a minute. How has the dynamic between what people are doing on the digital internet most consumers experience and what you need to do on the physical internet changed? It seems like something we don’t ever really get to talk about. I’m very curious to ask you about it. I think we consume most of the internet now in a mobile form, on our iPads, iPhones, or whatever. We still have some desktops, but it’s all laptops. The first point of connectivity there is mobile. It’s available to us all the time. But what we don’t think about is that it’s only mobile until it’s not. It needs to get terrestrialized to the nearest area where it comes down into terrestrial — typically fiber because to get really high speed, you need to use fiber. Wireless has some limitations around that. So basically, until it gets to any mobile application, its real objective is to get terrestrial into that cell tower as quickly as possible. Then, from the bottom of the cell tower is when all the magic starts, with the physical fiber cables and the networks that go around the world. If you have an inquiry, depending on what it is, that could require a different continent. That goes down through the cell tower and out across the sea and back to you. But that’s invisible to us all. We’re able to do it at such high speeds now that it’s transparent to the applications that you’re using. That’s the part I really want to dig into. Intellectually, I think I’ve always understood that. I think most people understand that there are servers and data centers elsewhere and we are communicating with them somehow. But at some point we need to hit a fiber line and actually talk to those servers. What I’m trying to understand is that there’s the consumer application layer of the internet — we’re all going to watch a bunch of Instagram reels or something. Then, there’s the internet we need to build to support that. What’s the relationship between those two? How often do you think, “I see the next set of applications that are coming on phones, I see the next set of devices that people may want to use. or I see the rise of streaming services. We better start building an internet that can support it?” That dynamic often seems subsumed in some cell carrier or data center conversations. It very rarely comes to the forefront. Because it’s the piece that connects all of this stuff. Everybody focuses on things like AI, Netflix, or whatever right now. How do you get those things to manifest themselves to the consumer and to enterprise? The reality is that it required a massive build-out over the last two decades for a fiber infrastructure that basically connects all these data centers together, that connects them through submarine cables, and connects them across countries. It has intelligence on it so it knows where to go to get that information. That has evolved over the last two decades. It continues to evolve because if you think about some of the business models that we now take for granted, like Uber, that wouldn’t be available if you couldn’t get instant response to it. Twenty years ago, that would not have been possible as a business model. There was an interesting point in the early 2000s where there was this massive overbuild of fiber capacity. It was sort of the telecom nuclear winter where we had more capacity than apparently we’d need for the next two decades. People built out all of these large fiber networks and no one came. But that enabled business models to take large amounts of bandwidth at low cost. That created business models like Amazon, which weren’t able to get stimulated and be sustainable until they had large amounts of dependable connectivity. So it’s constantly evolving with applications that are demanding much higher bandwidth. We’re in an era of that now with AI for sure. The networks have to catch up and facilitate that. Let me ask about the networks. Let’s say I want to build a network in some rural part of the country. Do I just call Ciena and say, “All right. We’re going to get to work. Go dig some trenches”? Do I run the network? Do you run the network? How does that work? We don’t run the network. Those are the service provider carriers. If you take North America as an example, there are hundreds of carriers that do the local last mile piece out in the rural areas. Then, there’s the Verizons, Comcasts, and AT&Ts of this world that then facilitate all of that connectivity to the consumer. We provide the technology that powers their networks basically. For them to get that high-speed connectivity, Ciena’s technology goes on the ends of those fiber cables that allows the speed and throughput to continue to drive the capacity. What we basically do is virtualize a single piece of fiber. So instead of having that little thread, which is about a hair thread in terms of weight and distance, we can multiply that many, many times. That’s hundreds of virtual fibers because of the technology we use around it. That’s enabled the whole scaling of the internet. It’s enabled the scaling of this global connectivity phenomenon that we have, and it’s at the center of scaling for AI connectivity now and into the future. That core piece of technology where you’re multiplexing and virtualizing the single piece of fiber, that was Ciena’s big technology bet. I believe it’s called WDM. Explain that to people very quickly. Basically, it’s virtualization. Where you’ve got one piece of fiber, [WDM] makes it look like multiple fibers. Depending on the distance and what you’re putting down, it can be hundreds of fibers, which is actually physically manifested as a single fiber. So you don’t need to put more fibers into the ground. With the technology we have on either end of it, you can just scale it up. So, it’s the virtualization of fiber that has enabled this almost seamless marriage between the applications, to your point, and the driving of all the network traffic with the actual network. Through our technology development, we’ve grown the ability to go do that faster than Moore’s Law. We now have a new piece of technology, called WaveLogic, that can do 1.6 terabits of data down a single piece of fiber. It’s always been explained to me that the fiber is the fiber, and we’re just sending light back and forth. It’s the pieces at the end that actually create the additional bandwidth to create that additional capability. Is that more or less true? Are you just focused on the bits at the end that talk to each other? Absolutely. There are technology developments within the fiber that assist that, for sure, and there’s been a lot of that development from companies like Corning in the fiber world. But basically, the magic is the technology that goes on the end of those fibers. When you think about it, if we had to scale by digging up the place every time we wanted to put more fibers in, it’s just not practical. We can get a tremendous amount of expansion and virtual capacity even on old fibers just by putting our technology on the end of it. You were talking about scaling faster than Moore’s Law, which is roughly a doubling every 18 months. Decoder listeners are very pedantic. They will tell me that’s not actually what Moore’s Law means, but I think that’s how you’re using it. I appreciate our listeners very much, but I don’t think that’s what applies here. You’re talking about a doubling of bandwidth every 18 months. Yes. You’ve been doing WDM since 1997, right? This is the technology bet of the company. Is it the capacity of WDM where you’re using multiple wavelengths of light across a single fiber? Is that what’s doubling? Yeah, it’s our ability to continue to drive that. When we first started, we could multiplex and keep it very simple. It was a single piece of fiber. We thought we could put four virtual fibers down there. That was revolutionary at the time. Many of the carriers we went to with that said, “Oh, that’s fantastic. We’ll never need more than that.” Then, we figured out how to do eight, then 16, then 32, then 64. And we’re way, way beyond that now. So what that means is you have that single piece of fiber that looks like 64 fibers. That’s enabled this massive scaling of architecture around the world. Then, we deploy that technology not just with local connectivity, but across the country and whole continents — 8,000, 10,000-mile submarine cables. We can support that kind of capacity across the submarine cables. Do you just sell these boxes to the telecom and data center providers and walk away? Do you have ongoing support? No, it’s a very integrated partnership. Most of the major carriers — I think 96 percent of the major carriers around the world — are Ciena customers. These are collaborations that we’ve worked on for multiple decades. We help manage the networks. We do a lot of the installation work for them. We do the planning. We have the software that actually manages the network and looks for predictive issues or challenges and switches automatically. If there are problems on certain fibers, it will detect that and switch it through. So, there’s a lot of underlying technology and collaboration between us and all the service providers. Also all of the hyperscalers. Pretty much all of the hyperscalers use Ciena to connect their data centers around the world. We partner with them as well on technology developments that are specific to their networks. You look at the hyperscalers, some of the largest networks in the world, and they’re very complicated, multi-continent, metro, long-haul, submarine cables. The biggest players and the biggest owners of capacity on submarine cables now are actually the cloud players. That used to be the traditional service providers, but now it’s the likes of Google and Meta that really own a lot of the global capacity on those submarine cables. This is the thing that I was talking about at the beginning. It seems so hard to understand, and it’s so interesting to talk to you about it because you’re in it. The internet we experience is obviously changing the dynamics of the internet we build. So. I experience my phone and there’s a bunch of stuff happening on some data center owned by Google, Microsoft, or whatever, and that means those companies now own most of the capacity of undersea cables. I don’t think that chain of events is intuitive unless you’re paying attention to it. But just talking to you for 13 minutes here, that seems very intuitive to you. It makes sense to you that they would have the capacity because I’m not sending nearly as much data as a consumer across the ocean. Do you see that changing? How fast has that grown? Describe that dynamic to me. Take the submarine cables as an example. It’s a good proxy for what’s happened here. From the 1980s to 2010, this was all funded by the service providers. It was a way of getting transatlantic phone conversations largely to Europe and a little bit to Asia. These companies, like British Telecom and AT&T, would have these cables, they would get together a consortium, and, as a syndicate, fund these submarine cables. With the advent of cloud, you had these players that wanted to have very high-speed connectivity. Take for example Meta, Google, Microsoft, or any of these players. If they were going to be in the European market, they needed to have very high speed, dedicated capacity. So in about 2010, you began to see the cloud players purchasing the capacity of those submarine cables. In the last five years or so, you’ve seen Google begin to own many of these cables, with Meta and others too. So, it evolved from, “Hey, it’s all this service provider and it’s just phone calls.” When you want to reach your aunt in Europe, in India, or whatever, then it’s just a phone call, which is a very small amount of data. The amount of data that’s now being required by these cloud players is multiple more times than that. You’ve got a lot of graphics going over it as well, which takes a lot of bandwidth. So the need for bandwidth has grown dramatically. It makes sense that the cloud players want to connect their data centers. If they’re putting a data center in India and want to connect it to North America, they want to own the connectivity for that, and it’s a much higher speed. So they’re not just buying the capacity. They’re actually taking control and owning the cables. So, there’s been sort of an evolution of that over the last five years. The first 10 years was, “Hey, we will take the capacity now.” Their networks are made up of a hybrid of owning the cable, owning some, or they rent it from the service providers. But you’ve now got, I think, 600-plus submarine cables around the world. You’ve got about 1.5 million kilometers of fiber at the bottom of the sea facilitating this, and the cloud players are really driving that marketplace now. That’s going to lead us into the inevitable conversation we’ll have about AI, but I just want to stay on this for one second. How has the verticalization, from “what we sell is virtualized compute capacity” down to “we will now own the cables in the ocean and verticalize our business and make sure we own it tip to tail,” changed your company? We’re looking at, “There’s WDM in 1997. This is the core innovation that lets us get more capacity out of the fiber networks. We’re initially going to sell that to telecom companies to do more phone calls or the early internet.” Now, multiple generations in, you’re selling it directly to Google to connect data centers so that it might run AI workloads.” It feels like that would have some pressure on your roadmaps and your go-to-market. How is that expressed? The evolution has been such that the first appreciators for that technology were obviously the service providers. As the internet began to gain traction in 2003, 2004, you began to see the cloud players get more interested in the network because if they’re going to monetize and get to the eyeballs that they wanted, the network actually becomes important to them. So, there’s been a steady increase in appreciation of that even prior to the AI piece, and they’ve become much more active. I mean, we really didn’t sell to the cloud players until about 10 years ago, and we had zero market share there. Now, we’ve got the main market share with a leading player in connecting data centers and cloud players around the world. Submarine cables are the same kind of thing. We really didn’t focus on the submarine cables with our technology because there wasn’t that much capacity being required. We’ve now got number one share in submarine cable connectivity around the world because they value very high-speed capacity. So the cloud players have gone from being a very small percentage of our business to over 50 percent of our business now being, directly or indirectly, cloud and hyperscalers. So it’s a very significant shift in the business, and that’s really accelerated in the last five years. I think this is a great time to ask the classic Decoder questions. You’re describing a shift in the business and a shift in your customers. How is Ciena organized now? What does that org chart look like? It’s been easier for us in some ways because we’ve always been the leading technology company, so it’s really about who appreciates that technology and collaborates. This shift to the submarine markets and to cloud players has generally been a good fit for Ciena because we move very quickly, and we’re at cutting-edge technology. The latest technology we have is actually on three-nanometer chips. We were the first company in the world to have a 3nm chip actually be used in the telecom space, and we’re now actually working on our second. We’ve got that out, it’s carrying traffic around the world, and we’re working on our second version of that. We’ve always been at the leading edge of technology, and it really is a natural fit with these cloud players. So, we’re organized very simply. We have a large-service provider team around the world, a dedicated team for the hyperscalers and cloud, and an engineering team that works with them on co-development and stuff with that kind of technology. I’m a great believer in simplicity of organizational design. So, we have a very simple organizational structure that’s evolved to address that. That’s how we’re able to scale as quickly as we have. You’ve got the two big markets — the telecoms and the hyperscalers — and you have the engineering organization. I’m assuming the telecoms and the cloud providers want different things. How is that expressed in what the engineering organization goes off and builds? It’s interesting. There’s a lot of commonality about what they want. If you think about it from an engineering point of view and the latest WaveLogic technology we just developed, we actually take that same technology and we deploy it in slightly different variants to both markets. So, we get a better scale of development over that. Obviously, we develop a single chip and then do variants of it for specific applications that they want, but that same technology is essentially consumed across the service provider world because they all want the same thing: better economics across the fiber that they’ve got and increased bandwidth. The particular sensitivity, I would say — what’s really the difference between the two markets — is the cloud players are much more focused on power, which we all hear about from a data center point of view. It manifests itself exactly the same way in the telecom networks. We do variants that are power optimized for the cloud players, but that’s the predominant difference. That’s just taking the same core technology and doing a different variant of it that’s prioritized around power. That enables us to scale the development and the rest of it. So, we have a single global engineering team focused on this core technology. Ciena has always been a very focused player. We’ve been very focused on just high-speed connectivity. This has enabled us when most of our competitors are trying to do mobile or other kinds of things. For the past three decades, we just wanted to be the best in the world at moving optical bits at a high speed. The opportunity we have now is increasingly into the campus and potentially even inside the data center with that same core technology, and that’s all in front of us. We get zero revenue from there right now. But it’s the same customers, so that’s an exciting opportunity for us in the future. I want to talk about that a little bit more, but can I just ask one more question? You said power. That suggests to me that you’re building a data center, you have an energy budget, and then you hold all the vendors to some number on the line to make sure you hit your energy budget. You’re feeling that too, even as the person is like, “Here’s the box that connects to the fiber line.” Yes. It manifests itself differently obviously, but everybody talks about the data centers and the power and the rest of it. Everybody is very focused on that for obvious reasons. But that same issue deploys when they come out onto the network too. You put amplifiers on the fiber to do that, and around these amplification sites, they want super low power because they are constrained around power and space. I’m assuming they would rather spend their power budget on running the GPUs as hot as they can. Exactly. They don’t want to spend it on the communications part, or they want to spend as little as possible on that. They want it optimized. We’re able to do that for them in terms of the footprint of the technology. We can now get down on a single plug what used to be a rack of cords. Quite literally, a six-foot-wide rack on a single plug, that same capacity. That’s what we’ve evolved over the last two decades with. So, we’re well placed with these guys to continue to drive down the power usage on the network, not just in the data center. How big is Ciena? How many people are on all of these various teams? We’re close to about 10,000 people worldwide. We’re very distributed. This year’s consensus revenue is about $4.4 billion, something like that. We’re profitable, and we have a strong balance sheet. We very much invest directly into this technology. Because we’ve been such a focused player at it, we felt that this high-speed connectivity would be appreciated eventually, and it’s really coming into its own now. You have to make these investments for the long term. Some of our technologies take five-plus years to evolve. We’re fortunate in this time right now. It’s a good intersection point where high-speed technology is super appreciated. Is that an even split? Is it 3,300 in engineering, 3,300 in hyperscaler sales- No, it’s basically predominantly engineering. As you can imagine, this kind of technology is more about engineering, so more than half of our team are engineering talent. We’ve got applications engineers at the front end who help make sure we understand the applications and work with the customers on that, but more than half is engineering. As I said to you earlier on, it’s a very simple structure. One of the things that really strikes me is there is this core enabling invention, WDM. The company is built around it. Ciena’s made a few acquisitions over the years. You’ve led a few of them. There was one in 2019 for Centina Systems. Is WDM still the heart of it? Is that proprietary Ciena we’re building around it? Is there a next way to use fiber that’s coming? No, it’s basically the journey that we’re on. We’ve made multiple acquisitions, but it’s all been about the core mission, which is high-speed connectivity and the things we need around that. A lot of the acquisitions have been around vertical integration of that, so we have more control over it. It’s not just the core technology. It’s the things around it that you need to do. Most of those surrounding technologies were where we could focus and provide competitive advantage by doing something to them. Over the years, we’ve worked very carefully at acquisitions and organic developments that make us vertically integrated so we can control that. There’s advantages to control and scale, but what really drove us was that we think we can put competitive advantages in each of the technologies that we gather around the core technology, if that makes sense. The reason I’m asking that is because often you might want to buy a company that’s early to the next turn, but it seems like WDM is still the heart of what you’re doing, and you don’t see a finish line there. Basically, it’s this technology. The actual variant that we focus on is the coherent technology, and that’s what has enabled this DWDM to scale so much. But there are other technologies around it that we’ve developed, like the SerDes — the Serializer / Deserializer — and the kinds of things that are for analog conversion, which is incredibly difficult to do. We’ve got some of the best technology in the world around that. It’s the moat that you put around that, but it’s not the next thing. We think there’s a lot of headroom, particularly because this technology is all deployed right now. Think about it outside the data center. So as soon as it wants to present outside the data center, that’s Ciena. The opportunities we have with the same kinds of technology are now becoming apparent inside the campus — these campuses are getting super big now — and eventually will be inside the data center. That’s because the GPU and compute investment that’s going on requires higher and higher speed over longer and longer distances, even in some of these data centers. First of all, they’re enormous. You’ve got fiber going around them, sometimes multiple kilometers within a single data center with that fiber getting wrapped around. We think there’s an intersection point for our technology there. The technology there right now, which is just called direct-connect, is required to connect all of the racks within the data center and the intra-data center. The physics of that is getting challenged as these GPUs require higher and higher speed. So, we think there’s a real opportunity for us to intersect that, to your point, with the same kind of core technology that requires some variations over the next 1–3 years. Let me ask you the classic Decoder question, and then I want to get into that. You’ve been at Ciena for a long time. I think you’ve been there for 30 years. You’ve been the CEO for almost 25 now. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? Depends on what kind of decision it is, right? Not all decisions are equal. I very much feel that it’s a team game. When we make strategic decisions — which I think is what you’re alluding to with how we invest and what long-term things we’re focused on — we’re strategically aligned around what we want to go do. We’re a very focused company. Back to the point I was making earlier, I think people appreciate the best of breed, and we want to be the best in the world at what we do. The north star is very clear to us. Then, it’s about what things we need to do to get out into the future on that. From that point of view, the decision making is somewhat easier because we know we’ve chopped the field, so we know where we’re playing on. There’s not some great conversation about adjacencies and things that we might want to get into; it’s all based on our core technology. To answer your question, if it’s something strategic around those investments, it’s always a team game. We’re super collaborative. It’s how we work and get cross-functional input into all of those things. So, it’s a process. But I would say that I think the role of a CEO sometimes is to say, “Okay. We’ve had the debate. This is the overall perspective of what we want to do. Let’s go.” I think part of the role of the CEO is to facilitate the best conversations and discussions and then help drive to a conclusion. Let me give you a hypothetical that I suspect you will shrug off, but I’m going to try anyway. You’re looking at two big groups of clients. You’ve got your telecom companies, and you’ve got your big cloud providers who are all racing into AI. You have some opportunity to grow that business by going into the data centers, not just landing the fiber at the doorstep. That seems like the much richer opportunity. I look at the state of the telecoms in the United States, for example. They’re not growing much, right? They’re churning customers between them. It would seem very obvious that your entire team would say, “Don’t worry about them so much. We need to put all of our focus on the AI providers because that is where there’s growth using our same core technology.” But then you still have to service the telecom customers, I imagine. How do you balance that out? How do you make that decision to say, “These investments are going to go over here?” It’s actually much easier for us because, back to the point I was making, it’s the same kind of core technology. When we move the ball down the field for the cloud players, we can apply that to the service provider space because it’s the same core technology. In terms of their needs, there are actually a lot of similarities. Another way of thinking about this is when we start talking about the data center and the rest of it, we provide optical systems where we do the whole thing for the service providers. And we do that pretty much for the cloud players too. So we do all of the systems for the software, what we call the WDM modem technology, and the line systems. We do all of that, and often we’ll install it, support it, and maintain it. We do that for service providers and we do that for the cloud players. Then, to the point around the opportunity in the data center, it’s not necessarily about providing those complete systems. It’s taking them, putting them in plugs, and then putting them in components. So it’s a different kind of play, but it’s still the core technology. So, anything you do to advance that also applies to our systems business, and our systems business is both service provider and in the cloud. You don’t have to make the “which are your favorite children?” kind of choice, which is where you were going with that. I think that’s another benefit of a company staying super focused on its core technology and understanding what value we bring to the world. That is very difficult for anybody else to replicate, Well, can I ask you about that? Because it feels like the Trump administration is incoming. By the time people listen to this, he will have been inaugurated and we’ll be off to the races with a new kind of business climate here in the United States. Mergers will be in fashion again. They have not been in fashion over the past four years. If I was running Google or Microsoft, I would say, “Well, this is the core technology that’s going to make my data center more efficient and move data faster on my cable. I’m just going to buy this company.” Have you been approached to be acquired? Well, I’m not going to– I’m just wondering because I can see why over the past several years, all of that conversation has chilled. But it’s also remarkable to me that a company like Ciena has remained independent for 30 years. That used to be the conversation all the time. Think about 20 years ago. I’m not sure some of your viewers will remember some of these names: Lucent, Alcatel, Nortel, even Nokia. The model was all what I call the “generalist model.” They were actually spin outs from their phone companies like Marconi. Northern Telecom came out of Canada. So with the model, we had to be end to end. You had to put switches, routers, handsets, mobile infrastructure, and this thing called transport. We said when we started, “No, we’re going to just focus on the transport piece because we think it can get to scale.” What’s happened over the last two decades is that the generalists, because they couldn’t afford to be at the cutting edge in each of those areas, have all struggled. You trace the genesis of all of those companies now and basically they’re all in Nokia. With Alcatel and Lucent and all the rest of them, the music stopped and that’s where they ended up. The point I’m making about that is the world’s too competitive now for the whole end-to-end thing and being a generalist supplier. It just absolutely is. They used to say to us, “Well, when are you going to get bought?” We used to say, “Listen, we’re a public company. We have all the fiduciary responsibilities that you would expect with a public company, but we think we can get to scale and be a real company just doing what we’re doing.” Now, these things take a while and we’ve been public for 25 years, but we’re at a point now where we absolutely have scale. We’re very strong financially. We can invest in this kind of technology. We’ve got the number one market share in all the key markets that we want to play in. So, we’ve got a good opportunity to drive shareholder value from here. Do you think that DWDM, the multiplexing you do to virtualize the fiber, is enough of a moat? You were describing the other acquisitions you’ve made and how you surround the core technology with other things to enter different markets as the moat. But is that core technology something that… I don’t know if Mark Zuckerberg woke up one morning and was like, “screw it, I’m open sourcing it,” he could just do it? Or is that more specialized? There are other companies that have variants of this technology, for sure. It’s just that we’re able to implement it faster and quicker and better than anybody else, and we have the core competencies around it. A bit of an analogy is TSMC. People kind of know how to do [what TSMC does], but they can’t do it, right? You can go to ASML and ask for a machine and that’s not where it stops. Yeah. Because it’s people, and it’s the folks that understand that it’s the five, 10 percent of each of these areas that really make the difference to things when you put it and all the things we’ve built around it all together. So like with any of these things, it’s a confluence that makes up the competitive advantage. It’s when you get down to the real technologies. It’s all of those things that provide the moat for us. It’s the fact that we’re focused and the fact that we’re now so embedded with these key cloud and technology companies and were part of the collaboration process around the evolution of their networks. It’s the relationships that you build up, that trusted relationship and the technology collaboration over time. That’s why we think we’ve got an opportunity to take that into a whole new market for us with the campus and eventually inside the data center. I want to talk about two things that seem like they’re going to happen to the hyperscalers, in particular, over the next four, 10 years. One of them has a lot to do with subsea cables and the other one is obviously AI. Let’s start with subsea cables. If I look broadly at our nation’s big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta, Apple — they’re about to enter into a world where an emboldened Donald Trump wants to just reset the international order. They own cables that connect our continents together. There’s a lot of people who want to break the internet apart in different ways. We might ban TikTok. We might not ban TikTok. China doesn’t allow our apps there. There’s a lot of interest in what is happening on our networks that connect our countries together and who gets what where. Then there’s just the reality that they are wires in the ground. Bad things happen to them. They get cut. There are wars. How much of that do you engage with personally? How much do you think about, “Okay. There are some fraught geopolitics that are about to change. I need to make some decisions to get ahead of it, be aware of it, insulate myself against it, or insulate Ciena against it?” How much of your time do you spend on that? I mean, there are the headings of things you can control and then things that you can’t control but need to be mindful of, right? It’s definitely in that second list. I could argue that over the last five or 10 years we’ve had quite a lot of geopolitical dynamics going on. We are mindful of that, particularly because we operate in multiple countries, so 80 countries around the world. Our technology is widely deployed. We are mindful of those kinds of dynamics, and I’ll give you an example. We made a decision in the early 2000s that we would not go in and be a provider to the Chinese market for its major service providers. There was a whole set of thought processes that went into that. One of our competitors at the time was Huawei and it was just emerging. I don’t think people appreciate this, but the first real iteration of technology that Huawei came out with was actually in our space, so way before all the mobile stuff and all the other omnipotent things that it’s now doing. So around 2003 we said, “What’s this company, what are they doing, and how is it achieving price points that are just lower than our cost?” Turns out that we’re being subsidized by the Chinese government, right? It’s like we’ve seen this movie several times since 2003. So one of the thought processes that we had, just to give you an illustration , we said, “You know what? We will not compete with it directly in the China market. It obviously wants us there because we’ve got leading technology and the rest of it. We’re actually not going to manufacture in China either. So we’re going to be the antithesis, if you like, of Huawei in every single way. We’re going to be the alternative that’s not a Chinese manufacturer, and we won’t operate there.” That was a very controversial thing. You imagine a young company that’s just gone public and going, “Hang on a minute, why are you not going into the largest market and fastest growing telecom market in the world?” But we had the strength of our convictions. It’s taken a while, but I think largely that was a good decision for us because we didn’t get distracted by that Chinese market. They’ll give you 10 percent of that market, but they’ll make sure you won’t get anything else, and you’ll partner with a local partner. I spent a lot of time in Asia. I lived in Asia for a number of years before I came to Ciena. And I saw that movie, to your point, play out in so many different ways. I was super sensitive to that, as was the team. So, that is an instance of us doing something because of the geopolitical dynamics at the time and us making a decision. You don’t know how that’s going to play out because things can change., You’ve just got to be smart around what you think is the best thing for the shareholders and your company and stick to it. Do you mostly follow the lead of the clients? Do you have your own points of view on geopolitics? I’m thinking of things like when you land the cable in Europe and your devices there decoding all the traffic that there are a number of European spy agencies that might want to sit right next to that. The NSA in our country would love to sit right next to that. When you land in other countries that have different kinds of privacy and security concerns, they might want to be a part of that. Is that something where you say, “Look, Meta owns this cable. You talk to Meta. We’re going to do what the client says,” or is that, “We are simply not going to build these cables in certain devices”? We’re actually pretty fortunate that we don’t have to make some of those tough decisions because it’s not our cable. So to your point — But the data going over the cable, that’s you, right? You’re encoding and decoding it? Yeah, that’s what we’re doing, but even that technology is owned by the customer. We sold that to the customer, and what they do with it is entirely up to them. We don’t have control over that. It’s their network.. It’s their property. You think about these submarine cables. Someone owns the cable, and we put the technology on the end of it. It’s their technology. They own that, and they run it as well. We don’t run it. So they run those networks. We’re fortunate in that we’ve always been able to stay one step behind some of those dilemma questions. It’s not something we have to opine on. When you think about the actual cables, they’re in international waters. What’s the longest one that you operate? I think it’s about 10,000 kilometers. Some of these cables are around the Pacific where you get the big distances, so they are very, very long cables. A lot of them stop off on different islands and places and spur off. Some of the new cables going in are spurring off in different places. We’ve also developed a technology that overlays that provides for resilience. So if you get a cut on a particular cable, then we can reroute it depending on the architecture. It’s called GeoMesh. It’s software and technology that’s embedded into our core offerings and enables us to provide resilience across some of those submarine cable links. In the normal run of things, you get I think something like 100-plus faults a year, mainly trawlers dragging their anchors on a fiber cable because they’re buried at the bottom of the sea until they’re not. I mean, they’ve got to come up somewhere. Typically, it’s in the shallower waters where you’ll get some fishing vessel come across it. Do you ever get angry sharks? Do you ever get a text message like “shark attack brought down the network?” Actually, that’s a common question I get asked around it. There is a section around fish attacks. I think it’s zero. I’m sure there are some examples of it that someone can point to over the last three decades, but I’ve never heard of it personally. I think they’ve got other things to worry about than these little tiny... it’s about the size of a big hosepipe, so I don’t think it’d be particularly interesting to them. We have this phrase that we’ve been using at The Verge, my friend Casey Newton came up with it ages ago. He calls it the “Splinternet,” where we perceive one cohesive internet, but really we’re fracturing. We’re fracturing into continent-specific, country-specific internets. As I talked to you about the cloud providers, it’s very obvious to me that we now have a number of private internets operating at high speed around the world that are just owned and controlled by single companies. You have a long view of the internet. You are one of the few guests on Decoder who’s ever just straight up talked about Alcatel. You have a long view of the internet, how we’ve grown it, and what it’s for. The telecoms, by and large, were national champions, right? That’s how they have thought about themselves. Even in the United States, that’s how they’ve thought about themselves. That’s where they came from. There’s a new kind of nationalism in America around our tech giants in the Trump administration. Mark Zuckerberg says, “I want the Trump administration to go fight the European regulators on my behalf.” That’s new, it hasn’t come up before. We’ll see if this jacket fits. He’s trying it on. But the way we build networks is an expression of national capability. We haven’t experienced that too much as the internet. It’s been one global internet that connects all, and then we do whatever we want and set our borders. But we haven’t actually split the networks apart. But now you’ve got big cloud provider private networks. You do have rising nationalism around the world. You just have a pulling apart of the internet. Is that affecting how you are building networks or how your clients are asking you to build networks? I totally understand the notion, and I think what you’ve got is that a disproportionate amount — this is sort of an English understatement — of the innovation and development for all of this has been done in the US, amongst all these technology companies, for sure. Now, the big cloud players are investing in that network because that’s their business model, and the network is becoming more and more important. When we talk about the network, to your point, we talk about it in this homogeneous form. But if you think about this in the context of some of the large markets that the US cloud players are trying to get into… take places like India. When they enter the Indian market, they are dependent upon connectivity from the local carriers. So they can tip up with the submarine cables and the landing stations, but then it’s, “How do I get connected to all the people I need to get connected to in India enterprise and consumer?” They are then dependent on the local carriers, be it Bharti, Jio, Vodafone Idea, some of the wholesale carriers that are also there, and fiber. There’s always going to be an interrelationship because as omnipotent as all of these cloud players are, they’re not going to be able to connect to everybody’s home across the planet. So you’ve always got this interplay between service providers and the cloud players. What often happens there is that in some of these countries, the service provider will provide a specific network for the cloud player, and they call it a Managed Optical Fiber Network, or MOFN. And we help facilitate that. It’s our technology, so it matches all of their global networks. But it’s owned and operated by the local service provider to support Meta, Google, Microsoft, etc. Increasingly, I’d argue you’re seeing that interdependency work. So, I wouldn’t say it’s the counter-argument to the idea that we’re all splitting up because at the end of the day, to get to the consumers around the world, these service providers are not going away in that regard. That’s not going to change. They are the only ones that can provide that connectivity ultimately, be it the enterprise or the consumer. I’m fascinated by this because it does seem like the overall geopolitical dynamics of the world are changing, and the internet will change with it. I just keep coming back to the question I started with, which is about how the experience we have on the digital internet obviously impacts the physical internet that you are responsible for building. I’m always trying to find the touchpoints between the two. The way we architect networks in India has a direct relationship to the Indian internet that those users experience, and it seems like those things are, if not diverging completely between different countries, certainly beginning down different paths. That, to me, seems utterly fascinating. I want to end with AI here. As you think about entering their data centers and saying, “We can envision some new high bandwidth, high capacity workloads in these data centers,” which for the past 15 years we have not really come up with massive new ones outside of streaming video. Streaming video is a lot, but that’s basically what we came up with. Now there’s some new ones in AI that might hit all kinds of new industries. Do you think that that is just an exponential rise in how much capacity we need, how much power we’ll need to use, how much networking capacity that we’ll sustain? Or is it, to make the comparison earlier to dark fiber, building out a lot of capacity that we’ll eventually use over time? That’s a great question. Having lived through the previous period of the telecom nuclear winter where we built out all this capacity — and as it turned out, no one came — it did facilitate all these business models that wouldn’t have accelerated without that glut of capacity. I get asked the question if we’re in another bubble around all of these data centers. Specifically around the data center piece, I think there’s an insatiable demand for compute, to build out compute power. These things always take longer than we all think to monetize and the rest of it, so we’re probably going to go through some iterations. But to answer your real question, I’m actually of the opposite view this time round. I think we’re underestimating the amount of traffic and bandwidth that will be required to go do this because we’re already seeing a clip up in cloud traffic. We’re pretty well placed to see that. Now, how much of that could I attribute to AI? Some of it is, but I’ve got no way of really discerning which bit is which, and it’s not our network. But there’s a definite uptick in cloud traffic just to connect to all of these data centers. We are absolutely seeing that, and I think that’s going to continue because you’ve got a lot more data centers coming online in the next 18 months, or two years around the world. If they’re going to monetize any of that, they’ve got to all be connected for learning, training, and the rest of it. That’s before you even see the applications for medical use or verticalization, whatever you want to call it. Using your ChatGPTs is generating traffic, sure. But then you start to get to any of that medical usage, for example, and the amount of graphics that are required. Graphics are about 10–20 times more bandwidth-consuming than normal data. So, if you start to get to the monetization of that through these vertical applications, I think we’re underestimating the amount of traffic that’s going to be there. When you plan out growth for the company — obviously, you’re a public company, so you have to do it out in front of everyone and talk about risk — in your most optimistic view, is it sustainable, the rate of demand that you see now? You’re saying we’re underestimating it. I look at it maybe a bit more cynically, which is, “Wow, we are building a lot of capacity against business models that don’t exist.” OpenAI has yet to turn $1 in profit, and it wants all of the power that the world can generate. It wants every GPU that Nvidia can build. That’s a lot, right? There’s an inherent promise there that this will all pay off. Maybe you would call that a bubble or maybe you won’t. I’m just looking at it more mathematically. A lot of companies are going to sell a lot of things to these data centers. We’re going to build a lot of capacity, and maybe at some point we will have built enough or not enough or something will happen, but that will come to an end. Then a company like yours is saying, “Well, we’ve had this rate of growth and now maybe it’s plateaued or maybe it’s going down.” How are you thinking about that? I think about it like this: Don’t confuse compute capacity with the network. The network is always the afterthought to all of this, right? It’s, “Oh my gosh, I do actually need to connect these data centers.” So what’s the hierarchy of their thought process? It’s, “I need the compute. I need the power. I need the space.” Those are the things that are driving their decision. Then by the way, “Oh my gosh, I need to connect these data centers right now.” I’m being flippant, but it is down there. I’d like to tell you it was right up there, but it isn’t. In the answer to this question, I think that’s actually a good thing. We only get there when they need it. They’re not building out these enormous capacities because we see it. We’re putting capacity out there, and they’re putting traffic down it. So I take real comfort from that, having lived through 2002 and 2003 when our revenues went down from something like $1.6 billion to about $300 million in one year. I’ve still got the scars from that, so I’m particularly sensitive to this. This is not the same dynamic. They are actually putting capacity out, and as fast as we put it out there, traffic is coming through it. To your point and to what a lot of other folks are saying, is it going to get overheated in terms of the GPU stuff and the data centers and the rest of it? In my personal opinion? Absolutely. Will there be a bit of a tail off in all of that? Absolutely. Will it take longer for applications in the AI world to truly generate the economics? Absolutely. But we’re not banking on that. We’re just seeing this nice steady growth in bandwidth, which I think will pervade throughout. Here’s another way of answering your question. Over the last two decades, bandwidth has grown about 20, 30 percent a year and is not cyclical. When you think about it, it shouldn’t be cyclical, should it? We’re just putting more and more applications out, we’re using our phones for more stuff, more people are getting phones, and all these devices are now connected. That has been very steady and consistent throughout. Even when you get an economic downturn, it continues at about that pace. What we’re talking about here is the advent of AI on top of that. Exactly what is it going to be? No one really knows. There’s all these models, but no one really knows. But it’s reasonable to assume that it’s going to come on top of that and could push us to 30, 40 percent bandwidth growth per year, and I think that’s going to be pretty sustainable. When you think about all the promise of AI, the real trick to it is you start putting any graphics down it. Every time you hear [Google CEO] Sundar Pichai say multi-modal AI, I can see the dollar signs floating through the offices over there. I love it. We’re basically planning our business on what we see, and we’ve taken our growth rates up. Typically, this business has grown. We’ve grown about 7 or 8 percent. We’re now saying it’s going to grow 8 to 11 percent over the next three years, and that’s without any massive entry into the data center space or anything else. It’s just what we see from a cloud growth point of view. You’ve talked a lot about entering the data center using the same core technology that you use for the undersea cables and the telecom providers. What are the barriers to doing that and what were the things you assessed when you thought, “Okay. This is the market we have to address”? The barriers to entry there are that you’ve got a technology called direct-connect, which has been well ensconced there really since the start of communication in data centers. You’ve got an ecosystem there that is going to be designed to elongate that for as long as possible, and the customers want to keep it for as long as possible. With the analytics we’ve done on it and working with them, they think that there’s going to be an intersection point where the physics of that gets to the point where it’s not sustainable. We think we’ve got to the point with power and space where there’s a good intersection. So it’s the analytics around that and working with two or three of these players who are already our customers but outside the data center. Is that them coming to you or are you going to them? A little bit of both. We have strong relationships with them, so that collaboration has been there. We’re realistic about it. The existing way of working and that direct-connect? That’s not going away. That’s probably still the majority of applications for it. So you’re looking at what the subset of corner-case applications are for this kind of high-speed connectivity. But even a small part of that is massive for us and massive from a scale point of view given the amount of spend that’s gone on in that space. It’s always about taking risks when that market isn’t there right now, but if you wait until that market appears, it’s too late. If you’re waiting for, “Oh, what’s the market share of this and what’s the growth rate?” At the end of the day, you’ve just got to go with what your intuition is and what you’re hearing and seeing from the customers and the rest. So we’ve got our first iteration of technology for this coming out at the end of the year. That’s a bet that we placed two, three years ago. As you know, the timing takes a while with some of these chip designs and stuff. You have to guess where the market’s going to go, not where it is right now. There’s always an element of risk to it. Listen, having gone through some of this before, you’re never going to get it completely right. You just have to be in the right vector, pay attention, and tweak along the way around it. So we’re listening intently. Gary, this was an incredible conversation. You’re going to have to come back sometime. I could talk to you about this for hours and hours. Love to. I enjoyed it, Nilay. Good questions. Good stuff. We’ll see. We should have you back a couple of years from now and see how stressed you are about these undersea cables. I think that would be very interesting. We’re certainly in for some entertainment, aren’t we? I know what we’re writing about for the next four years. Gary, this is amazing. Thank you so much.

One of the biggest tech companies you’ve never heard of is helping you listen to this podcast. by Nilay Patel One of the biggest tech companies you’ve never heard of is helping you listen to this podcast. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Gary Smith, CEO of the networking company Ciena. You probably aren’t familiar with Ciena — the company isn’t really a household name. But every internet user has relied on the company’s products; in fact, every internet user has used its products. Ciena makes the hardware and software that make the fiber optic cables that connect the world light up with data. That’s everything from local fiber networks for broadband ISPs to the massive undersea cables that connect continents. There’s a high probability that this very podcast came to you over a Ciena-powered network, in fact — this company is everywhere. Gary himself is a fascinating character in this story. He joined Ciena in 1997, the year the company had an astonishingly successful IPO in the middle of the dotcom boom. And he became its CEO in 2001, right after the dotcom crash sent the company’s stock price — and the rest of the economy — into a tailspin. So Gary has had a front-row seat to the development of the internet as we know it, and Ciena has been there every step of the way — as telecoms and undersea cables first brought the planet online, all the way to the rise of cloud computing and, now, generative AI. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! You’re going to hear Gary and I talk a lot about something called WDM, or Wavelength Division Multiplexing, which is the fundamental technical innovation Ciena is built around. WDM is absolutely key to how the modern internet works, and most people have no idea it exists. The basic idea is that WDM uses multiple wavelengths of light to fit more data onto a single fiber optic cable, which allows those cables to deliver more and more information over time — you’ll hear Gary call it “virtualizing” a fiber optic cable, like you’re turning a single cable into two, or five, or 10. This is obviously hugely important as the world’s internet usage increases and data-hungry applications like streaming video and generative AI ramp up. Ciena didn’t invent WDM, but it was the first company to deploy it commercially in the ’90s — and I wanted to know how Gary was managing his investment in pushing that technology forward and whether he was thinking about the next kind of tech that might disrupt it. I also wanted to know about Ciena’s customers. There are only so many companies building deep sea cables and giant data centers, and it won’t surprise you that the customer set has largely shifted from telecom providers and ISPs to giant cloud computing companies like Meta and Google and Microsoft over the past few years. Just a few months ago, Meta announced it would pay $10 billion to build its own exclusive subsea cable stretching nearly 25,000 miles. Ciena sits right in the middle of that complicated relationship between industry and infrastructure, and I think you’ll find Gary’s perspective to be pretty unique. We also got into the fracturing state of the internet and what it means that people in different geographic locations, dependent on various levels of government control, experience the online world differently. Connecting cables stretching across continents means the people on either end of those cables might have very different ideas about the internet, and Ciena has to take all of that into account. See, I’m guessing you didn’t know about Ciena before, but almost every single Decoder idea is right here, sitting on the backbone of the internet. Okay, Ciena CEO Gary Smith. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Gary Smith, you’re the CEO of Ciena. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you. Good to be here. I am very excited to talk to you. The Decoder team and I were talking earlier about how we love stories of hidden companies that run the world, and Ciena very much feels like one of those companies. It is a huge player in networking. It’s a huge player in the future of our networks. There’s some AI to talk about. There’s undersea cables to talk about, which is always fun. Quickly, for everyone, describe what Ciena is and what you do. Basically, Ciena is the leading technology company in the world for providing high-speed connectivity. So if you think about all the networks that have been enabled around the internet and around the world, or, as you alluded to, submarine cables, Ciena is really the driving force behind that high-speed technology. Even with mobile connectivity, terrestrial connectivity, and submarine cable connectivity, we’re basically the best in the world at moving optical bits. I always think about it as two internets, right? There’s the internet we experience — the digital internet — and then there’s the physical internet: the actual cables and wires that connect our networks together and connect us together. That is Ciena’s business, running these cables, figuring out how to move data across them more quickly, and figuring out how to move more data across them. Ciena’s been around for a minute. How has the dynamic between what people are doing on the digital internet most consumers experience and what you need to do on the physical internet changed? It seems like something we don’t ever really get to talk about. I’m very curious to ask you about it. I think we consume most of the internet now in a mobile form, on our iPads, iPhones, or whatever. We still have some desktops, but it’s all laptops. The first point of connectivity there is mobile. It’s available to us all the time. But what we don’t think about is that it’s only mobile until it’s not. It needs to get terrestrialized to the nearest area where it comes down into terrestrial — typically fiber because to get really high speed, you need to use fiber. Wireless has some limitations around that. So basically, until it gets to any mobile application, its real objective is to get terrestrial into that cell tower as quickly as possible. Then, from the bottom of the cell tower is when all the magic starts, with the physical fiber cables and the networks that go around the world. If you have an inquiry, depending on what it is, that could require a different continent. That goes down through the cell tower and out across the sea and back to you. But that’s invisible to us all. We’re able to do it at such high speeds now that it’s transparent to the applications that you’re using. That’s the part I really want to dig into. Intellectually, I think I’ve always understood that. I think most people understand that there are servers and data centers elsewhere and we are communicating with them somehow. But at some point we need to hit a fiber line and actually talk to those servers. What I’m trying to understand is that there’s the consumer application layer of the internet — we’re all going to watch a bunch of Instagram reels or something. Then, there’s the internet we need to build to support that. What’s the relationship between those two? How often do you think, “I see the next set of applications that are coming on phones, I see the next set of devices that people may want to use. or I see the rise of streaming services. We better start building an internet that can support it?” That dynamic often seems subsumed in some cell carrier or data center conversations. It very rarely comes to the forefront. Because it’s the piece that connects all of this stuff. Everybody focuses on things like AI, Netflix, or whatever right now. How do you get those things to manifest themselves to the consumer and to enterprise? The reality is that it required a massive build-out over the last two decades for a fiber infrastructure that basically connects all these data centers together, that connects them through submarine cables, and connects them across countries. It has intelligence on it so it knows where to go to get that information. That has evolved over the last two decades. It continues to evolve because if you think about some of the business models that we now take for granted, like Uber, that wouldn’t be available if you couldn’t get instant response to it. Twenty years ago, that would not have been possible as a business model. There was an interesting point in the early 2000s where there was this massive overbuild of fiber capacity. It was sort of the telecom nuclear winter where we had more capacity than apparently we’d need for the next two decades. People built out all of these large fiber networks and no one came. But that enabled business models to take large amounts of bandwidth at low cost. That created business models like Amazon, which weren’t able to get stimulated and be sustainable until they had large amounts of dependable connectivity. So it’s constantly evolving with applications that are demanding much higher bandwidth. We’re in an era of that now with AI for sure. The networks have to catch up and facilitate that. Let me ask about the networks. Let’s say I want to build a network in some rural part of the country. Do I just call Ciena and say, “All right. We’re going to get to work. Go dig some trenches”? Do I run the network? Do you run the network? How does that work? We don’t run the network. Those are the service provider carriers. If you take North America as an example, there are hundreds of carriers that do the local last mile piece out in the rural areas. Then, there’s the Verizons, Comcasts, and AT&Ts of this world that then facilitate all of that connectivity to the consumer. We provide the technology that powers their networks basically. For them to get that high-speed connectivity, Ciena’s technology goes on the ends of those fiber cables that allows the speed and throughput to continue to drive the capacity. What we basically do is virtualize a single piece of fiber. So instead of having that little thread, which is about a hair thread in terms of weight and distance, we can multiply that many, many times. That’s hundreds of virtual fibers because of the technology we use around it. That’s enabled the whole scaling of the internet. It’s enabled the scaling of this global connectivity phenomenon that we have, and it’s at the center of scaling for AI connectivity now and into the future. That core piece of technology where you’re multiplexing and virtualizing the single piece of fiber, that was Ciena’s big technology bet. I believe it’s called WDM. Explain that to people very quickly. Basically, it’s virtualization. Where you’ve got one piece of fiber, [WDM] makes it look like multiple fibers. Depending on the distance and what you’re putting down, it can be hundreds of fibers, which is actually physically manifested as a single fiber. So you don’t need to put more fibers into the ground. With the technology we have on either end of it, you can just scale it up. So, it’s the virtualization of fiber that has enabled this almost seamless marriage between the applications, to your point, and the driving of all the network traffic with the actual network. Through our technology development, we’ve grown the ability to go do that faster than Moore’s Law. We now have a new piece of technology, called WaveLogic, that can do 1.6 terabits of data down a single piece of fiber. It’s always been explained to me that the fiber is the fiber, and we’re just sending light back and forth. It’s the pieces at the end that actually create the additional bandwidth to create that additional capability. Is that more or less true? Are you just focused on the bits at the end that talk to each other? Absolutely. There are technology developments within the fiber that assist that, for sure, and there’s been a lot of that development from companies like Corning in the fiber world. But basically, the magic is the technology that goes on the end of those fibers. When you think about it, if we had to scale by digging up the place every time we wanted to put more fibers in, it’s just not practical. We can get a tremendous amount of expansion and virtual capacity even on old fibers just by putting our technology on the end of it. You were talking about scaling faster than Moore’s Law, which is roughly a doubling every 18 months. Decoder listeners are very pedantic. They will tell me that’s not actually what Moore’s Law means, but I think that’s how you’re using it. I appreciate our listeners very much, but I don’t think that’s what applies here. You’re talking about a doubling of bandwidth every 18 months. Yes. You’ve been doing WDM since 1997, right? This is the technology bet of the company. Is it the capacity of WDM where you’re using multiple wavelengths of light across a single fiber? Is that what’s doubling? Yeah, it’s our ability to continue to drive that. When we first started, we could multiplex and keep it very simple. It was a single piece of fiber. We thought we could put four virtual fibers down there. That was revolutionary at the time. Many of the carriers we went to with that said, “Oh, that’s fantastic. We’ll never need more than that.” Then, we figured out how to do eight, then 16, then 32, then 64. And we’re way, way beyond that now. So what that means is you have that single piece of fiber that looks like 64 fibers. That’s enabled this massive scaling of architecture around the world. Then, we deploy that technology not just with local connectivity, but across the country and whole continents — 8,000, 10,000-mile submarine cables. We can support that kind of capacity across the submarine cables. Do you just sell these boxes to the telecom and data center providers and walk away? Do you have ongoing support? No, it’s a very integrated partnership. Most of the major carriers — I think 96 percent of the major carriers around the world — are Ciena customers. These are collaborations that we’ve worked on for multiple decades. We help manage the networks. We do a lot of the installation work for them. We do the planning. We have the software that actually manages the network and looks for predictive issues or challenges and switches automatically. If there are problems on certain fibers, it will detect that and switch it through. So, there’s a lot of underlying technology and collaboration between us and all the service providers. Also all of the hyperscalers. Pretty much all of the hyperscalers use Ciena to connect their data centers around the world. We partner with them as well on technology developments that are specific to their networks. You look at the hyperscalers, some of the largest networks in the world, and they’re very complicated, multi-continent, metro, long-haul, submarine cables. The biggest players and the biggest owners of capacity on submarine cables now are actually the cloud players. That used to be the traditional service providers, but now it’s the likes of Google and Meta that really own a lot of the global capacity on those submarine cables. This is the thing that I was talking about at the beginning. It seems so hard to understand, and it’s so interesting to talk to you about it because you’re in it. The internet we experience is obviously changing the dynamics of the internet we build. So. I experience my phone and there’s a bunch of stuff happening on some data center owned by Google, Microsoft, or whatever, and that means those companies now own most of the capacity of undersea cables. I don’t think that chain of events is intuitive unless you’re paying attention to it. But just talking to you for 13 minutes here, that seems very intuitive to you. It makes sense to you that they would have the capacity because I’m not sending nearly as much data as a consumer across the ocean. Do you see that changing? How fast has that grown? Describe that dynamic to me. Take the submarine cables as an example. It’s a good proxy for what’s happened here. From the 1980s to 2010, this was all funded by the service providers. It was a way of getting transatlantic phone conversations largely to Europe and a little bit to Asia. These companies, like British Telecom and AT&T, would have these cables, they would get together a consortium, and, as a syndicate, fund these submarine cables. With the advent of cloud, you had these players that wanted to have very high-speed connectivity. Take for example Meta, Google, Microsoft, or any of these players. If they were going to be in the European market, they needed to have very high speed, dedicated capacity. So in about 2010, you began to see the cloud players purchasing the capacity of those submarine cables. In the last five years or so, you’ve seen Google begin to own many of these cables, with Meta and others too. So, it evolved from, “Hey, it’s all this service provider and it’s just phone calls.” When you want to reach your aunt in Europe, in India, or whatever, then it’s just a phone call, which is a very small amount of data. The amount of data that’s now being required by these cloud players is multiple more times than that. You’ve got a lot of graphics going over it as well, which takes a lot of bandwidth. So the need for bandwidth has grown dramatically. It makes sense that the cloud players want to connect their data centers. If they’re putting a data center in India and want to connect it to North America, they want to own the connectivity for that, and it’s a much higher speed. So they’re not just buying the capacity. They’re actually taking control and owning the cables. So, there’s been sort of an evolution of that over the last five years. The first 10 years was, “Hey, we will take the capacity now.” Their networks are made up of a hybrid of owning the cable, owning some, or they rent it from the service providers. But you’ve now got, I think, 600-plus submarine cables around the world. You’ve got about 1.5 million kilometers of fiber at the bottom of the sea facilitating this, and the cloud players are really driving that marketplace now. That’s going to lead us into the inevitable conversation we’ll have about AI, but I just want to stay on this for one second. How has the verticalization, from “what we sell is virtualized compute capacity” down to “we will now own the cables in the ocean and verticalize our business and make sure we own it tip to tail,” changed your company? We’re looking at, “There’s WDM in 1997. This is the core innovation that lets us get more capacity out of the fiber networks. We’re initially going to sell that to telecom companies to do more phone calls or the early internet.” Now, multiple generations in, you’re selling it directly to Google to connect data centers so that it might run AI workloads.” It feels like that would have some pressure on your roadmaps and your go-to-market. How is that expressed? The evolution has been such that the first appreciators for that technology were obviously the service providers. As the internet began to gain traction in 2003, 2004, you began to see the cloud players get more interested in the network because if they’re going to monetize and get to the eyeballs that they wanted, the network actually becomes important to them. So, there’s been a steady increase in appreciation of that even prior to the AI piece, and they’ve become much more active. I mean, we really didn’t sell to the cloud players until about 10 years ago, and we had zero market share there. Now, we’ve got the main market share with a leading player in connecting data centers and cloud players around the world. Submarine cables are the same kind of thing. We really didn’t focus on the submarine cables with our technology because there wasn’t that much capacity being required. We’ve now got number one share in submarine cable connectivity around the world because they value very high-speed capacity. So the cloud players have gone from being a very small percentage of our business to over 50 percent of our business now being, directly or indirectly, cloud and hyperscalers. So it’s a very significant shift in the business, and that’s really accelerated in the last five years. I think this is a great time to ask the classic Decoder questions. You’re describing a shift in the business and a shift in your customers. How is Ciena organized now? What does that org chart look like? It’s been easier for us in some ways because we’ve always been the leading technology company, so it’s really about who appreciates that technology and collaborates. This shift to the submarine markets and to cloud players has generally been a good fit for Ciena because we move very quickly, and we’re at cutting-edge technology. The latest technology we have is actually on three-nanometer chips. We were the first company in the world to have a 3nm chip actually be used in the telecom space, and we’re now actually working on our second. We’ve got that out, it’s carrying traffic around the world, and we’re working on our second version of that. We’ve always been at the leading edge of technology, and it really is a natural fit with these cloud players. So, we’re organized very simply. We have a large-service provider team around the world, a dedicated team for the hyperscalers and cloud, and an engineering team that works with them on co-development and stuff with that kind of technology. I’m a great believer in simplicity of organizational design. So, we have a very simple organizational structure that’s evolved to address that. That’s how we’re able to scale as quickly as we have. You’ve got the two big markets — the telecoms and the hyperscalers — and you have the engineering organization. I’m assuming the telecoms and the cloud providers want different things. How is that expressed in what the engineering organization goes off and builds? It’s interesting. There’s a lot of commonality about what they want. If you think about it from an engineering point of view and the latest WaveLogic technology we just developed, we actually take that same technology and we deploy it in slightly different variants to both markets. So, we get a better scale of development over that. Obviously, we develop a single chip and then do variants of it for specific applications that they want, but that same technology is essentially consumed across the service provider world because they all want the same thing: better economics across the fiber that they’ve got and increased bandwidth. The particular sensitivity, I would say — what’s really the difference between the two markets — is the cloud players are much more focused on power, which we all hear about from a data center point of view. It manifests itself exactly the same way in the telecom networks. We do variants that are power optimized for the cloud players, but that’s the predominant difference. That’s just taking the same core technology and doing a different variant of it that’s prioritized around power. That enables us to scale the development and the rest of it. So, we have a single global engineering team focused on this core technology. Ciena has always been a very focused player. We’ve been very focused on just high-speed connectivity. This has enabled us when most of our competitors are trying to do mobile or other kinds of things. For the past three decades, we just wanted to be the best in the world at moving optical bits at a high speed. The opportunity we have now is increasingly into the campus and potentially even inside the data center with that same core technology, and that’s all in front of us. We get zero revenue from there right now. But it’s the same customers, so that’s an exciting opportunity for us in the future. I want to talk about that a little bit more, but can I just ask one more question? You said power. That suggests to me that you’re building a data center, you have an energy budget, and then you hold all the vendors to some number on the line to make sure you hit your energy budget. You’re feeling that too, even as the person is like, “Here’s the box that connects to the fiber line.” Yes. It manifests itself differently obviously, but everybody talks about the data centers and the power and the rest of it. Everybody is very focused on that for obvious reasons. But that same issue deploys when they come out onto the network too. You put amplifiers on the fiber to do that, and around these amplification sites, they want super low power because they are constrained around power and space. I’m assuming they would rather spend their power budget on running the GPUs as hot as they can. Exactly. They don’t want to spend it on the communications part, or they want to spend as little as possible on that. They want it optimized. We’re able to do that for them in terms of the footprint of the technology. We can now get down on a single plug what used to be a rack of cords. Quite literally, a six-foot-wide rack on a single plug, that same capacity. That’s what we’ve evolved over the last two decades with. So, we’re well placed with these guys to continue to drive down the power usage on the network, not just in the data center. How big is Ciena? How many people are on all of these various teams? We’re close to about 10,000 people worldwide. We’re very distributed. This year’s consensus revenue is about $4.4 billion, something like that. We’re profitable, and we have a strong balance sheet. We very much invest directly into this technology. Because we’ve been such a focused player at it, we felt that this high-speed connectivity would be appreciated eventually, and it’s really coming into its own now. You have to make these investments for the long term. Some of our technologies take five-plus years to evolve. We’re fortunate in this time right now. It’s a good intersection point where high-speed technology is super appreciated. Is that an even split? Is it 3,300 in engineering, 3,300 in hyperscaler sales- No, it’s basically predominantly engineering. As you can imagine, this kind of technology is more about engineering, so more than half of our team are engineering talent. We’ve got applications engineers at the front end who help make sure we understand the applications and work with the customers on that, but more than half is engineering. As I said to you earlier on, it’s a very simple structure. One of the things that really strikes me is there is this core enabling invention, WDM. The company is built around it. Ciena’s made a few acquisitions over the years. You’ve led a few of them. There was one in 2019 for Centina Systems. Is WDM still the heart of it? Is that proprietary Ciena we’re building around it? Is there a next way to use fiber that’s coming? No, it’s basically the journey that we’re on. We’ve made multiple acquisitions, but it’s all been about the core mission, which is high-speed connectivity and the things we need around that. A lot of the acquisitions have been around vertical integration of that, so we have more control over it. It’s not just the core technology. It’s the things around it that you need to do. Most of those surrounding technologies were where we could focus and provide competitive advantage by doing something to them. Over the years, we’ve worked very carefully at acquisitions and organic developments that make us vertically integrated so we can control that. There’s advantages to control and scale, but what really drove us was that we think we can put competitive advantages in each of the technologies that we gather around the core technology, if that makes sense. The reason I’m asking that is because often you might want to buy a company that’s early to the next turn, but it seems like WDM is still the heart of what you’re doing, and you don’t see a finish line there. Basically, it’s this technology. The actual variant that we focus on is the coherent technology, and that’s what has enabled this DWDM to scale so much. But there are other technologies around it that we’ve developed, like the SerDes — the Serializer / Deserializer — and the kinds of things that are for analog conversion, which is incredibly difficult to do. We’ve got some of the best technology in the world around that. It’s the moat that you put around that, but it’s not the next thing. We think there’s a lot of headroom, particularly because this technology is all deployed right now. Think about it outside the data center. So as soon as it wants to present outside the data center, that’s Ciena. The opportunities we have with the same kinds of technology are now becoming apparent inside the campus — these campuses are getting super big now — and eventually will be inside the data center. That’s because the GPU and compute investment that’s going on requires higher and higher speed over longer and longer distances, even in some of these data centers. First of all, they’re enormous. You’ve got fiber going around them, sometimes multiple kilometers within a single data center with that fiber getting wrapped around. We think there’s an intersection point for our technology there. The technology there right now, which is just called direct-connect, is required to connect all of the racks within the data center and the intra-data center. The physics of that is getting challenged as these GPUs require higher and higher speed. So, we think there’s a real opportunity for us to intersect that, to your point, with the same kind of core technology that requires some variations over the next 1–3 years. Let me ask you the classic Decoder question, and then I want to get into that. You’ve been at Ciena for a long time. I think you’ve been there for 30 years. You’ve been the CEO for almost 25 now. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? Depends on what kind of decision it is, right? Not all decisions are equal. I very much feel that it’s a team game. When we make strategic decisions — which I think is what you’re alluding to with how we invest and what long-term things we’re focused on — we’re strategically aligned around what we want to go do. We’re a very focused company. Back to the point I was making earlier, I think people appreciate the best of breed, and we want to be the best in the world at what we do. The north star is very clear to us. Then, it’s about what things we need to do to get out into the future on that. From that point of view, the decision making is somewhat easier because we know we’ve chopped the field, so we know where we’re playing on. There’s not some great conversation about adjacencies and things that we might want to get into; it’s all based on our core technology. To answer your question, if it’s something strategic around those investments, it’s always a team game. We’re super collaborative. It’s how we work and get cross-functional input into all of those things. So, it’s a process. But I would say that I think the role of a CEO sometimes is to say, “Okay. We’ve had the debate. This is the overall perspective of what we want to do. Let’s go.” I think part of the role of the CEO is to facilitate the best conversations and discussions and then help drive to a conclusion. Let me give you a hypothetical that I suspect you will shrug off, but I’m going to try anyway. You’re looking at two big groups of clients. You’ve got your telecom companies, and you’ve got your big cloud providers who are all racing into AI. You have some opportunity to grow that business by going into the data centers, not just landing the fiber at the doorstep. That seems like the much richer opportunity. I look at the state of the telecoms in the United States, for example. They’re not growing much, right? They’re churning customers between them. It would seem very obvious that your entire team would say, “Don’t worry about them so much. We need to put all of our focus on the AI providers because that is where there’s growth using our same core technology.” But then you still have to service the telecom customers, I imagine. How do you balance that out? How do you make that decision to say, “These investments are going to go over here?” It’s actually much easier for us because, back to the point I was making, it’s the same kind of core technology. When we move the ball down the field for the cloud players, we can apply that to the service provider space because it’s the same core technology. In terms of their needs, there are actually a lot of similarities. Another way of thinking about this is when we start talking about the data center and the rest of it, we provide optical systems where we do the whole thing for the service providers. And we do that pretty much for the cloud players too. So we do all of the systems for the software, what we call the WDM modem technology, and the line systems. We do all of that, and often we’ll install it, support it, and maintain it. We do that for service providers and we do that for the cloud players. Then, to the point around the opportunity in the data center, it’s not necessarily about providing those complete systems. It’s taking them, putting them in plugs, and then putting them in components. So it’s a different kind of play, but it’s still the core technology. So, anything you do to advance that also applies to our systems business, and our systems business is both service provider and in the cloud. You don’t have to make the “which are your favorite children?” kind of choice, which is where you were going with that. I think that’s another benefit of a company staying super focused on its core technology and understanding what value we bring to the world. That is very difficult for anybody else to replicate, Well, can I ask you about that? Because it feels like the Trump administration is incoming. By the time people listen to this, he will have been inaugurated and we’ll be off to the races with a new kind of business climate here in the United States. Mergers will be in fashion again. They have not been in fashion over the past four years. If I was running Google or Microsoft, I would say, “Well, this is the core technology that’s going to make my data center more efficient and move data faster on my cable. I’m just going to buy this company.” Have you been approached to be acquired? Well, I’m not going to– I’m just wondering because I can see why over the past several years, all of that conversation has chilled. But it’s also remarkable to me that a company like Ciena has remained independent for 30 years. That used to be the conversation all the time. Think about 20 years ago. I’m not sure some of your viewers will remember some of these names: Lucent, Alcatel, Nortel, even Nokia. The model was all what I call the “generalist model.” They were actually spin outs from their phone companies like Marconi. Northern Telecom came out of Canada. So with the model, we had to be end to end. You had to put switches, routers, handsets, mobile infrastructure, and this thing called transport. We said when we started, “No, we’re going to just focus on the transport piece because we think it can get to scale.” What’s happened over the last two decades is that the generalists, because they couldn’t afford to be at the cutting edge in each of those areas, have all struggled. You trace the genesis of all of those companies now and basically they’re all in Nokia. With Alcatel and Lucent and all the rest of them, the music stopped and that’s where they ended up. The point I’m making about that is the world’s too competitive now for the whole end-to-end thing and being a generalist supplier. It just absolutely is. They used to say to us, “Well, when are you going to get bought?” We used to say, “Listen, we’re a public company. We have all the fiduciary responsibilities that you would expect with a public company, but we think we can get to scale and be a real company just doing what we’re doing.” Now, these things take a while and we’ve been public for 25 years, but we’re at a point now where we absolutely have scale. We’re very strong financially. We can invest in this kind of technology. We’ve got the number one market share in all the key markets that we want to play in. So, we’ve got a good opportunity to drive shareholder value from here. Do you think that DWDM, the multiplexing you do to virtualize the fiber, is enough of a moat? You were describing the other acquisitions you’ve made and how you surround the core technology with other things to enter different markets as the moat. But is that core technology something that… I don’t know if Mark Zuckerberg woke up one morning and was like, “screw it, I’m open sourcing it,” he could just do it? Or is that more specialized? There are other companies that have variants of this technology, for sure. It’s just that we’re able to implement it faster and quicker and better than anybody else, and we have the core competencies around it. A bit of an analogy is TSMC. People kind of know how to do [what TSMC does], but they can’t do it, right? You can go to ASML and ask for a machine and that’s not where it stops. Yeah. Because it’s people, and it’s the folks that understand that it’s the five, 10 percent of each of these areas that really make the difference to things when you put it and all the things we’ve built around it all together. So like with any of these things, it’s a confluence that makes up the competitive advantage. It’s when you get down to the real technologies. It’s all of those things that provide the moat for us. It’s the fact that we’re focused and the fact that we’re now so embedded with these key cloud and technology companies and were part of the collaboration process around the evolution of their networks. It’s the relationships that you build up, that trusted relationship and the technology collaboration over time. That’s why we think we’ve got an opportunity to take that into a whole new market for us with the campus and eventually inside the data center. I want to talk about two things that seem like they’re going to happen to the hyperscalers, in particular, over the next four, 10 years. One of them has a lot to do with subsea cables and the other one is obviously AI. Let’s start with subsea cables. If I look broadly at our nation’s big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta, Apple — they’re about to enter into a world where an emboldened Donald Trump wants to just reset the international order. They own cables that connect our continents together. There’s a lot of people who want to break the internet apart in different ways. We might ban TikTok. We might not ban TikTok. China doesn’t allow our apps there. There’s a lot of interest in what is happening on our networks that connect our countries together and who gets what where. Then there’s just the reality that they are wires in the ground. Bad things happen to them. They get cut. There are wars. How much of that do you engage with personally? How much do you think about, “Okay. There are some fraught geopolitics that are about to change. I need to make some decisions to get ahead of it, be aware of it, insulate myself against it, or insulate Ciena against it?” How much of your time do you spend on that? I mean, there are the headings of things you can control and then things that you can’t control but need to be mindful of, right? It’s definitely in that second list. I could argue that over the last five or 10 years we’ve had quite a lot of geopolitical dynamics going on. We are mindful of that, particularly because we operate in multiple countries, so 80 countries around the world. Our technology is widely deployed. We are mindful of those kinds of dynamics, and I’ll give you an example. We made a decision in the early 2000s that we would not go in and be a provider to the Chinese market for its major service providers. There was a whole set of thought processes that went into that. One of our competitors at the time was Huawei and it was just emerging. I don’t think people appreciate this, but the first real iteration of technology that Huawei came out with was actually in our space, so way before all the mobile stuff and all the other omnipotent things that it’s now doing. So around 2003 we said, “What’s this company, what are they doing, and how is it achieving price points that are just lower than our cost?” Turns out that we’re being subsidized by the Chinese government, right? It’s like we’ve seen this movie several times since 2003. So one of the thought processes that we had, just to give you an illustration , we said, “You know what? We will not compete with it directly in the China market. It obviously wants us there because we’ve got leading technology and the rest of it. We’re actually not going to manufacture in China either. So we’re going to be the antithesis, if you like, of Huawei in every single way. We’re going to be the alternative that’s not a Chinese manufacturer, and we won’t operate there.” That was a very controversial thing. You imagine a young company that’s just gone public and going, “Hang on a minute, why are you not going into the largest market and fastest growing telecom market in the world?” But we had the strength of our convictions. It’s taken a while, but I think largely that was a good decision for us because we didn’t get distracted by that Chinese market. They’ll give you 10 percent of that market, but they’ll make sure you won’t get anything else, and you’ll partner with a local partner. I spent a lot of time in Asia. I lived in Asia for a number of years before I came to Ciena. And I saw that movie, to your point, play out in so many different ways. I was super sensitive to that, as was the team. So, that is an instance of us doing something because of the geopolitical dynamics at the time and us making a decision. You don’t know how that’s going to play out because things can change., You’ve just got to be smart around what you think is the best thing for the shareholders and your company and stick to it. Do you mostly follow the lead of the clients? Do you have your own points of view on geopolitics? I’m thinking of things like when you land the cable in Europe and your devices there decoding all the traffic that there are a number of European spy agencies that might want to sit right next to that. The NSA in our country would love to sit right next to that. When you land in other countries that have different kinds of privacy and security concerns, they might want to be a part of that. Is that something where you say, “Look, Meta owns this cable. You talk to Meta. We’re going to do what the client says,” or is that, “We are simply not going to build these cables in certain devices”? We’re actually pretty fortunate that we don’t have to make some of those tough decisions because it’s not our cable. So to your point — But the data going over the cable, that’s you, right? You’re encoding and decoding it? Yeah, that’s what we’re doing, but even that technology is owned by the customer. We sold that to the customer, and what they do with it is entirely up to them. We don’t have control over that. It’s their network.. It’s their property. You think about these submarine cables. Someone owns the cable, and we put the technology on the end of it. It’s their technology. They own that, and they run it as well. We don’t run it. So they run those networks. We’re fortunate in that we’ve always been able to stay one step behind some of those dilemma questions. It’s not something we have to opine on. When you think about the actual cables, they’re in international waters. What’s the longest one that you operate? I think it’s about 10,000 kilometers. Some of these cables are around the Pacific where you get the big distances, so they are very, very long cables. A lot of them stop off on different islands and places and spur off. Some of the new cables going in are spurring off in different places. We’ve also developed a technology that overlays that provides for resilience. So if you get a cut on a particular cable, then we can reroute it depending on the architecture. It’s called GeoMesh. It’s software and technology that’s embedded into our core offerings and enables us to provide resilience across some of those submarine cable links. In the normal run of things, you get I think something like 100-plus faults a year, mainly trawlers dragging their anchors on a fiber cable because they’re buried at the bottom of the sea until they’re not. I mean, they’ve got to come up somewhere. Typically, it’s in the shallower waters where you’ll get some fishing vessel come across it. Do you ever get angry sharks? Do you ever get a text message like “shark attack brought down the network?” Actually, that’s a common question I get asked around it. There is a section around fish attacks. I think it’s zero. I’m sure there are some examples of it that someone can point to over the last three decades, but I’ve never heard of it personally. I think they’ve got other things to worry about than these little tiny... it’s about the size of a big hosepipe, so I don’t think it’d be particularly interesting to them. We have this phrase that we’ve been using at The Verge, my friend Casey Newton came up with it ages ago. He calls it the “Splinternet,” where we perceive one cohesive internet, but really we’re fracturing. We’re fracturing into continent-specific, country-specific internets. As I talked to you about the cloud providers, it’s very obvious to me that we now have a number of private internets operating at high speed around the world that are just owned and controlled by single companies. You have a long view of the internet. You are one of the few guests on Decoder who’s ever just straight up talked about Alcatel. You have a long view of the internet, how we’ve grown it, and what it’s for. The telecoms, by and large, were national champions, right? That’s how they have thought about themselves. Even in the United States, that’s how they’ve thought about themselves. That’s where they came from. There’s a new kind of nationalism in America around our tech giants in the Trump administration. Mark Zuckerberg says, “I want the Trump administration to go fight the European regulators on my behalf.” That’s new, it hasn’t come up before. We’ll see if this jacket fits. He’s trying it on. But the way we build networks is an expression of national capability. We haven’t experienced that too much as the internet. It’s been one global internet that connects all, and then we do whatever we want and set our borders. But we haven’t actually split the networks apart. But now you’ve got big cloud provider private networks. You do have rising nationalism around the world. You just have a pulling apart of the internet. Is that affecting how you are building networks or how your clients are asking you to build networks? I totally understand the notion, and I think what you’ve got is that a disproportionate amount — this is sort of an English understatement — of the innovation and development for all of this has been done in the US, amongst all these technology companies, for sure. Now, the big cloud players are investing in that network because that’s their business model, and the network is becoming more and more important. When we talk about the network, to your point, we talk about it in this homogeneous form. But if you think about this in the context of some of the large markets that the US cloud players are trying to get into… take places like India. When they enter the Indian market, they are dependent upon connectivity from the local carriers. So they can tip up with the submarine cables and the landing stations, but then it’s, “How do I get connected to all the people I need to get connected to in India enterprise and consumer?” They are then dependent on the local carriers, be it Bharti, Jio, Vodafone Idea, some of the wholesale carriers that are also there, and fiber. There’s always going to be an interrelationship because as omnipotent as all of these cloud players are, they’re not going to be able to connect to everybody’s home across the planet. So you’ve always got this interplay between service providers and the cloud players. What often happens there is that in some of these countries, the service provider will provide a specific network for the cloud player, and they call it a Managed Optical Fiber Network, or MOFN. And we help facilitate that. It’s our technology, so it matches all of their global networks. But it’s owned and operated by the local service provider to support Meta, Google, Microsoft, etc. Increasingly, I’d argue you’re seeing that interdependency work. So, I wouldn’t say it’s the counter-argument to the idea that we’re all splitting up because at the end of the day, to get to the consumers around the world, these service providers are not going away in that regard. That’s not going to change. They are the only ones that can provide that connectivity ultimately, be it the enterprise or the consumer. I’m fascinated by this because it does seem like the overall geopolitical dynamics of the world are changing, and the internet will change with it. I just keep coming back to the question I started with, which is about how the experience we have on the digital internet obviously impacts the physical internet that you are responsible for building. I’m always trying to find the touchpoints between the two. The way we architect networks in India has a direct relationship to the Indian internet that those users experience, and it seems like those things are, if not diverging completely between different countries, certainly beginning down different paths. That, to me, seems utterly fascinating. I want to end with AI here. As you think about entering their data centers and saying, “We can envision some new high bandwidth, high capacity workloads in these data centers,” which for the past 15 years we have not really come up with massive new ones outside of streaming video. Streaming video is a lot, but that’s basically what we came up with. Now there’s some new ones in AI that might hit all kinds of new industries. Do you think that that is just an exponential rise in how much capacity we need, how much power we’ll need to use, how much networking capacity that we’ll sustain? Or is it, to make the comparison earlier to dark fiber, building out a lot of capacity that we’ll eventually use over time? That’s a great question. Having lived through the previous period of the telecom nuclear winter where we built out all this capacity — and as it turned out, no one came — it did facilitate all these business models that wouldn’t have accelerated without that glut of capacity. I get asked the question if we’re in another bubble around all of these data centers. Specifically around the data center piece, I think there’s an insatiable demand for compute, to build out compute power. These things always take longer than we all think to monetize and the rest of it, so we’re probably going to go through some iterations. But to answer your real question, I’m actually of the opposite view this time round. I think we’re underestimating the amount of traffic and bandwidth that will be required to go do this because we’re already seeing a clip up in cloud traffic. We’re pretty well placed to see that. Now, how much of that could I attribute to AI? Some of it is, but I’ve got no way of really discerning which bit is which, and it’s not our network. But there’s a definite uptick in cloud traffic just to connect to all of these data centers. We are absolutely seeing that, and I think that’s going to continue because you’ve got a lot more data centers coming online in the next 18 months, or two years around the world. If they’re going to monetize any of that, they’ve got to all be connected for learning, training, and the rest of it. That’s before you even see the applications for medical use or verticalization, whatever you want to call it. Using your ChatGPTs is generating traffic, sure. But then you start to get to any of that medical usage, for example, and the amount of graphics that are required. Graphics are about 10–20 times more bandwidth-consuming than normal data. So, if you start to get to the monetization of that through these vertical applications, I think we’re underestimating the amount of traffic that’s going to be there. When you plan out growth for the company — obviously, you’re a public company, so you have to do it out in front of everyone and talk about risk — in your most optimistic view, is it sustainable, the rate of demand that you see now? You’re saying we’re underestimating it. I look at it maybe a bit more cynically, which is, “Wow, we are building a lot of capacity against business models that don’t exist.” OpenAI has yet to turn $1 in profit, and it wants all of the power that the world can generate. It wants every GPU that Nvidia can build. That’s a lot, right? There’s an inherent promise there that this will all pay off. Maybe you would call that a bubble or maybe you won’t. I’m just looking at it more mathematically. A lot of companies are going to sell a lot of things to these data centers. We’re going to build a lot of capacity, and maybe at some point we will have built enough or not enough or something will happen, but that will come to an end. Then a company like yours is saying, “Well, we’ve had this rate of growth and now maybe it’s plateaued or maybe it’s going down.” How are you thinking about that? I think about it like this: Don’t confuse compute capacity with the network. The network is always the afterthought to all of this, right? It’s, “Oh my gosh, I do actually need to connect these data centers.” So what’s the hierarchy of their thought process? It’s, “I need the compute. I need the power. I need the space.” Those are the things that are driving their decision. Then by the way, “Oh my gosh, I need to connect these data centers right now.” I’m being flippant, but it is down there. I’d like to tell you it was right up there, but it isn’t. In the answer to this question, I think that’s actually a good thing. We only get there when they need it. They’re not building out these enormous capacities because we see it. We’re putting capacity out there, and they’re putting traffic down it. So I take real comfort from that, having lived through 2002 and 2003 when our revenues went down from something like $1.6 billion to about $300 million in one year. I’ve still got the scars from that, so I’m particularly sensitive to this. This is not the same dynamic. They are actually putting capacity out, and as fast as we put it out there, traffic is coming through it. To your point and to what a lot of other folks are saying, is it going to get overheated in terms of the GPU stuff and the data centers and the rest of it? In my personal opinion? Absolutely. Will there be a bit of a tail off in all of that? Absolutely. Will it take longer for applications in the AI world to truly generate the economics? Absolutely. But we’re not banking on that. We’re just seeing this nice steady growth in bandwidth, which I think will pervade throughout. Here’s another way of answering your question. Over the last two decades, bandwidth has grown about 20, 30 percent a year and is not cyclical. When you think about it, it shouldn’t be cyclical, should it? We’re just putting more and more applications out, we’re using our phones for more stuff, more people are getting phones, and all these devices are now connected. That has been very steady and consistent throughout. Even when you get an economic downturn, it continues at about that pace. What we’re talking about here is the advent of AI on top of that. Exactly what is it going to be? No one really knows. There’s all these models, but no one really knows. But it’s reasonable to assume that it’s going to come on top of that and could push us to 30, 40 percent bandwidth growth per year, and I think that’s going to be pretty sustainable. When you think about all the promise of AI, the real trick to it is you start putting any graphics down it. Every time you hear [Google CEO] Sundar Pichai say multi-modal AI, I can see the dollar signs floating through the offices over there. I love it. We’re basically planning our business on what we see, and we’ve taken our growth rates up. Typically, this business has grown. We’ve grown about 7 or 8 percent. We’re now saying it’s going to grow 8 to 11 percent over the next three years, and that’s without any massive entry into the data center space or anything else. It’s just what we see from a cloud growth point of view. You’ve talked a lot about entering the data center using the same core technology that you use for the undersea cables and the telecom providers. What are the barriers to doing that and what were the things you assessed when you thought, “Okay. This is the market we have to address”? The barriers to entry there are that you’ve got a technology called direct-connect, which has been well ensconced there really since the start of communication in data centers. You’ve got an ecosystem there that is going to be designed to elongate that for as long as possible, and the customers want to keep it for as long as possible. With the analytics we’ve done on it and working with them, they think that there’s going to be an intersection point where the physics of that gets to the point where it’s not sustainable. We think we’ve got to the point with power and space where there’s a good intersection. So it’s the analytics around that and working with two or three of these players who are already our customers but outside the data center. Is that them coming to you or are you going to them? A little bit of both. We have strong relationships with them, so that collaboration has been there. We’re realistic about it. The existing way of working and that direct-connect? That’s not going away. That’s probably still the majority of applications for it. So you’re looking at what the subset of corner-case applications are for this kind of high-speed connectivity. But even a small part of that is massive for us and massive from a scale point of view given the amount of spend that’s gone on in that space. It’s always about taking risks when that market isn’t there right now, but if you wait until that market appears, it’s too late. If you’re waiting for, “Oh, what’s the market share of this and what’s the growth rate?” At the end of the day, you’ve just got to go with what your intuition is and what you’re hearing and seeing from the customers and the rest. So we’ve got our first iteration of technology for this coming out at the end of the year. That’s a bet that we placed two, three years ago. As you know, the timing takes a while with some of these chip designs and stuff. You have to guess where the market’s going to go, not where it is right now. There’s always an element of risk to it. Listen, having gone through some of this before, you’re never going to get it completely right. You just have to be in the right vector, pay attention, and tweak along the way around it. So we’re listening intently. Gary, this was an incredible conversation. You’re going to have to come back sometime. I could talk to you about this for hours and hours. Love to. I enjoyed it, Nilay. Good questions. Good stuff. We’ll see. We should have you back a couple of years from now and see how stressed you are about these undersea cables. I think that would be very interesting. We’re certainly in for some entertainment, aren’t we? I know what we’re writing about for the next four years. Gary, this is amazing. Thank you so much.

Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, slid around 11%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020. Other AI trades like Micron and Arm Holdings dropped more than 8% and 9%, respectively. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices lost more than 14% and 5%, respectively. Constellation Energy and Vistra , two of the best-known derivative plays tied to the power buildout for AI, plummeted about more than 12% and 19%, respectively. International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, slid around 11%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020. Other AI trades like Micron and Arm Holdings dropped more than 8% and 9%, respectively. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices lost more than 14% and 5%, respectively. Constellation Energy and Vistra , two of the best-known derivative plays tied to the power buildout for AI, plummeted about more than 12% and 19%, respectively. International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, slid around 11%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020. Other AI trades like Micron and Arm Holdings dropped more than 8% and 9%, respectively. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices lost more than 14% and 5%, respectively. Constellation Energy and Vistra , two of the best-known derivative plays tied to the power buildout for AI, plummeted about more than 12% and 19%, respectively. International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Title: Has DeepSeek Ended The AI Run Led By NVIDIA? A Deep Dive Into What’s Next For The Magnificent Seven
URL: https://wccftech.com/has-deepseek-ended-the-ai-run-led-by-nvidia/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T14:45:42Z
Full Content:
Well, it's not a great day for AI investors, and NVIDIA in particular, since the Chinese firm DeepSeek has managed to disrupt industry norms with its newest R1 AI model, which is said to change the concept of model training and the resources involved behind it. If you have been living under the rocks or still haven't understood why the "AI markets" are panicking right now, this post is definitely for you. So, China has managed to launch an AI model that is said to be trained using significantly lower financial resources, which we'll talk about later, and this has stirred the debate on the fact whether the "AI supercycle" witnessed in the past year is overhyped or rather not worth the money poured into it. DeepSeek R1 has managed to compete with some of the top-end LLMs out there, with an "alleged" training cost that might seem shocking. Let's start with what DeepSeek R1 is, and how it differs from the others. The R1 is a one-of-a-kind open-source LLM model that is said to primarily rely on an implementation that hasn't been done by any other alternative out there. While we won't go much into technicals since that would make the post boring, but the important point to note here is that the R1 relies on a "Chain of Thought" process, which means that when a prompt is given to the AI model, it demonstrates the steps and conclusions it has made to reach to the final answer, that way, users can diagnose the part where the LLM had made a mistake in the first place. Another interesting fact about DeepSeek R1 is the use of "Reinforcement Learning" to achieve an outcome. It is a type of machine learning where the model interacts with the environment to make its decision through a "reward-based process." When a desirable outcome is reached, the model makes sure to opt for those where the reward is maximum, and in this way, it is certain that the desirable conclusion will be achieved. Whereas, with GPT's o1, the core focus is on supervised learning methods, which involve training the model on massive datasets of text and code, which ultimately requires more financial resources. Speaking of financial resources, there's a lot of misconception in the markets around DeepSeek's training costs, since the rumored "$5.6 million" figure is just the cost of running the final model, not the total cost. Since China is restricted from accessing cutting-edge AI computing hardware, it won't be wise of DeepSeek to reveal its AI arsenal, which is why the expert perception is that DeepSeek has power equivalent to its competitors, but undisclosed for now. $NVDA - MUSK SUGGESTS DEEPSEEK 'OBVIOUSLY' HAS MORE NVIDIA GPUS THAN CLAIMED Elon Musk and Alexandr Wang suggest DeepSeek has about 50,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, not the 10,000 A100s they claim, due to U.S. export controls. Musk, with experience from xAI, agrees with Wang's… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 27, 2025 Compared to OpenAI's GPT-o1, the R1 manages to be around five times cheaper for input and output tokens, which is why the market is taking this development with uncertainty and a surprise, but there's a pretty interesting touch to it, which we'll talk about next, and how people shouldn't panic around DeepSeek's accomplishment. NVIDIA has generated gigantic revenue over the past few quarters by selling AI compute resources, and mainstream companies in the Magnificent 7, including OpenAI, have access to superior technology compared to DeepSeek. Given that DeepSeek has managed to train R1 with confined computing, imagine what the companies can bring to the markets by having potent computing power, which makes this situation much more optimistic towards the future of the AI markets. There's no competition to NVIDIA's CUDA and the surrounding ecosystem, and it's safe to say that in the world where AI is emerging as a growing technology, we are just at the start. DeepSeek's implementation doesn't mark the end of the AI hype. Rather, it shows us the untapped potential of the technology, although the markets aren't taking this development with much optimism, as Team Green has managed to shave $300 billion+ from its market cap after DeepSeek's R1. But, we expect the dust to settle, once people realize the positive outcome of the situation. Moreover, this will prompt companies like Meta, Google and Amazon to speed up their respective AI solutions, and as a Cantor Fitzgerald analyst says, DeepSeek's achievement should rather turn us more bullish towards NVIDIA and the future of AI.

Title: 'AI's Sputnik moment': China-based DeepSeek's open-source models may be a real threat to the dominance of OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia

Some serious competition, at the very least. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. US-based companies have been at the forefront of the AI revolution, but now it looks like a new challenger has emerged. China-based DeepSeek is just over a year old, but the startup has released an open-source AI model called R1 that seems to have the rest of the industry worried. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the co-founder of High Flyer, an AI-driven hedge-fund (via Bloomberg). Despite being a mere fledgling in the AI world compared to some of the bigger names like OpenAI and Meta, the DeepSeek V3 family of AI models appear to be much more efficient than competitors' efforts like ChatGPT. Now R1, a new reasoning model fine-tuned from V3 training, also appears to be comparable in performance and accuracy to OpenAI's efforts. The Register has performed some early testing on R1 in comparison to OpenAI's o1, a similar "Chain of Thought" (CoT) model, and found that its capabilities seem remarkably similar—with the former even beating out the OpenAI model in the MATH-500 test. All while costing much less to train, with a Chiphell forum user claiming that "DeepSeek-R1 is priced at only about 3.65% of OpenAI o1" per million outputs. That's potentially bad news for Nvidia, which has been raking in cash as a result of high sales of its AI accelerator hardware to run the latest models at scale, taking the company's valuation up to the highest by market cap in the world at time of writing. According to some analysts, Nvidia's stock price is on track to shed nearly $400 billion dollars in the wake of R1's launch, although it appears to be holding relatively steady after a slump in early Monday trading. Dutch chip-maker ASML has seen its share price fall by more than 10% since R1's launch, while Siemens Energy dropped by 21%. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. US venture capitalist and advisor to Donald Trump, Marc Andreessen, made the comparison of R1's launch to the US and USSR space race, calling it "AI's Sputnik moment." Sputnik was a satellite launched by the USSR in 1957, and is widely thought to have wrongfooted the US government on the Soviet Union's space capabilities, leading to a space race between the two nations. What is artificial general intelligence?: We dive into the lingo of AI and what the terms actually mean. The elephant in the room, however, is trade sanctions. The US government has banned the export of high-end AI hardware to China, which some have speculated has led to a more efficient approach resulting in DeepSeek's new models. If so, that would suggest that the sanctions haven't had the effect that the US gov may have hoped. However, being a Chinese product (and given that many of the leading AI companies are US-based), it seems possible that restrictions may follow on its use for US companies, and potentially even those using US equipment, in the same fashion as the current trade sanctions. Either way, the release of DeepSeek-R1 appears to have caused a significant rumble in the AI markets. Whatever happens next, it seems that the US may no longer hold all the keys to advanced AI—and the world awaits it's response.

Title: Shiba Inu Community Highlights 10 Reasons Why SHIB ETF Approval Is Inevitable
URL: https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-community-highlights-10-reasons-why-shib-etf-approval-is-inevitable/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T14:27:49Z
Full Content:
As the Trump administration’s crypto executive order takes effect, expectations are rising for more Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approvals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2025. Among these anticipations, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community remains hopeful that a SHIB ETF could soon gain approval. In a tweet on Monday, “Shibizens” a Shiba Inu-focused news platform, outlined ten reasons why major financial institutions like BlackRock and Grayscale should list a SHIB ETF. Notably, the platform highlighted SHIB’s “massive market opportunity,” driven by its global base of over 1.3 million holders. It also pointed to Shibarium’s operational Layer 2 blockchain, which supports diverse use cases in gaming, DeFi, and utility tokens such as BONE and TREAT. The platform further emphasized SHIB’s affordability, which appeals to retail investors and expands the potential client base for institutional players. Its high liquidity and trading volume add to its stability, while the broad range of assets within the Shiba Inu ecosystem offers strong diversification prospects. Additionally, Shibizens argued that the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs sets a powerful precedent, demonstrating robust demand for crypto-based investment products. “Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have shown strong demand. SHIB, as a next-generation blockchain project, is a logical step to capture the growing appetite for diversified crypto products.” It wrote. As per the platform, SHIB’s commitment to social causes, exemplified by the Shib Karma Foundation, also resonates with ESG-conscious investors. Additionally, with its global reach and innovative blockchain approach, SHIB positions itself as a forward-thinking investment. In conclusion, the platform argued that introducing a SHIB ETF would play a key role in driving the next wave of crypto innovation while strengthening the position of issuers as forward-thinking leaders in wealth management. “By launching a SHIB ETF, companies like BlackRock can capitalize on emerging crypto trends, meet growing investor demand, and establish themselves as leaders in digital asset management,” It added. This surge in optimism follows the SEC’s approval of similar products for Bitcoin and Ethereum last year. Notably, after the spot ETH ETF approval last May, Shiba Inu’s pseudonymous lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, sent a congratulatory message to Ethereum, cryptically hinting that SHIB could be next in line. Lucie, a leading spokesperson for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has also consistently advocated for the potential of a SHIB ETF. Last July, she expressed strong confidence, stating, “Do I think a SHIB ETF will happen? Most definitely,” citing growing institutional interest in SHIB’s decentralized framework. Last week, Bloomberg ETF strategist Eric Balchunas suggested that more cryptocurrency ETFs, including those for TRUMP and DOGE, are likely to be approved before April, a move that could open doors for others like SHIB. That said, despite the SEC’s lack of indication regarding meme coin ETFs, the SHIB community remains resolute. Campaigns continue to apply pressure on asset managers to front such products to the SEC, with a Change.org petition led by the SHIB army aimed at Grayscale already attracting over 11,000 signatures.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 6:27:08 AM PST by lasereye Nasdaq futures plunged on Monday to lead a stock rout on Wall Street as a Chinese startup rattled faith in US leadership and profitability in AI, taking a hammer to Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech stocks. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) sank nearly 4%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) tumbled over 2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) fell 0.9%, or about 380 points, on the heels of a winning week for the major gauges. Markets have been rattled by claims by China's DeepSeek that its AI assistant uses cheaper chips and less data than leading models, but performs equally well. A surge in DeepSeek's popularity has spurred a scramble by investors to reassess bets that AI demand-driven growth will keep fueling gains for stocks. AI bellwether Nvidia's shares tumbled over 11% in pre-market trading, as chip-related names took a bruising. ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered. Shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) both slid about 6% amid worries about megacaps' hefty investment in AI. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground as techs sold off across the board. Big Tech earnings season kicks off this week, highlighted by results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft. Eyes will be on guidance for future profit as DeepSeek casts doubt on prospects for revenue. Investors started to flock to assets seen as safe as stocks plunged. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell as much as 12 basis points to 4.50%, the lowest level in over a month, while haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc surged.

It has sparked discussions about the effectiveness of U.S. export restrictions on advanced AI chips to China. The DeepSeek-V3 model, which uses Nvidia’s H800 chips, is gaining recognition for its competitive performance, challenging the global dominance of U.S. AI models. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepSeek Note: AI technology is outside my expertise.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) fell 0.9%, or about 380 points, on the heels of a winning week for the major gauges. Markets have been rattled by claims by China's DeepSeek that its AI assistant uses cheaper chips and less data than leading models, but performs equally well. A surge in DeepSeek's popularity has spurred a scramble by investors to reassess bets that AI demand-driven growth will keep fueling gains for stocks. AI bellwether Nvidia's shares tumbled over 11% in pre-market trading, as chip-related names took a bruising. ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered. Shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) both slid about 6% amid worries about megacaps' hefty investment in AI. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground as techs sold off across the board. Big Tech earnings season kicks off this week, highlighted by results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft. Eyes will be on guidance for future profit as DeepSeek casts doubt on prospects for revenue. Investors started to flock to assets seen as safe as stocks plunged. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell as much as 12 basis points to 4.50%, the lowest level in over a month, while haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc surged.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq futures tank, Dow tumbles 350 points as AI fears rock tech stocks

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 6:27:08 AM PST by lasereye Nasdaq futures plunged on Monday to lead a stock rout on Wall Street as a Chinese startup rattled faith in US leadership and profitability in AI, taking a hammer to Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech stocks. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) sank nearly 4%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) tumbled over 2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) fell 0.9%, or about 380 points, on the heels of a winning week for the major gauges. Markets have been rattled by claims by China's DeepSeek that its AI assistant uses cheaper chips and less data than leading models, but performs equally well. A surge in DeepSeek's popularity has spurred a scramble by investors to reassess bets that AI demand-driven growth will keep fueling gains for stocks. AI bellwether Nvidia's shares tumbled over 11% in pre-market trading, as chip-related names took a bruising. ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered. Shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) both slid about 6% amid worries about megacaps' hefty investment in AI. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground as techs sold off across the board. Big Tech earnings season kicks off this week, highlighted by results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft. Eyes will be on guidance for future profit as DeepSeek casts doubt on prospects for revenue. Investors started to flock to assets seen as safe as stocks plunged. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell as much as 12 basis points to 4.50%, the lowest level in over a month, while haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc surged.

ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered.

Title: DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about Big Tech earnings. New developments from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech names prompted a pause in the US AI trade. Nvidia stock dropped more than 16%. Meanwhile, fellow "Magnificent Seven" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) were all off 2% or more. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, fell over 17%. "When expectations are high, one skeptical headline can knock the market off its axis," Ritholtz Wealth Management chief markets strategist Callie Cox wrote in a note on Monday. "That’s exactly what we’re seeing today." A slowdown in Big Tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice. "You have so much concentration in one area of the market — this has been the AI dominant themed market — and all of a sudden you bring in some uncertainty to that market, the initial reaction is to sell first and ask questions later," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. Unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, DeepSeek's new AI model appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through. "The biggest risks are the ones that we're not talking about," Lerner said. "And everyone thinks it's tariffs and China. And, you know, really, what we're finding out is [DeepSeek] wasn't on anyone's bingo card."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about Big Tech earnings. New developments from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech names prompted a pause in the US AI trade. Nvidia stock dropped more than 16%. Meanwhile, fellow "Magnificent Seven" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) were all off 2% or more. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, fell over 17%. "When expectations are high, one skeptical headline can knock the market off its axis," Ritholtz Wealth Management chief markets strategist Callie Cox wrote in a note on Monday. "That’s exactly what we’re seeing today." A slowdown in Big Tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice. "You have so much concentration in one area of the market — this has been the AI dominant themed market — and all of a sudden you bring in some uncertainty to that market, the initial reaction is to sell first and ask questions later," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. Unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, DeepSeek's new AI model appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through. "The biggest risks are the ones that we're not talking about," Lerner said. "And everyone thinks it's tariffs and China. And, you know, really, what we're finding out is [DeepSeek] wasn't on anyone's bingo card." In 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, Big Tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. With NVIDIA shedding nearly half a trillion dollars in market capitalization today as analysts and investors alike begin to question the demand paradigm for hyperscalers, especially given the purportedly phenomenal efficiency gains demonstrated by DeepSeek's R1 AI model, Wall Street analysts are coming out in droves with broadly reassuring takes on the GPU giant's prospects. As we've noted in a previous post, China's DeepSeek recently shocked the global tech industry by training its R1 model at a cost of just around $6 million, which is roughly 1/50th the cost of comparable LLMs from the US and the EU. The model, in some respects, is quite superior to OpenAI's o1 model. What's more, the R1's operating costs are just 3 percent of what OpenAI typically charges for compute-intensive outputs. ALRIGHT, HERE’S MY QUICK, TECH-FLAVORED RUNDOWN OF DEEPSEEK, WHY IT’S SO COST-EFFICIENT: 1) Big Picture on Cost: Traditional AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic) blow through $100M+ in compute to train something like GPT-4. DeepSeek reportedly did a similarly capable model for just $6… https://t.co/etCMxlWJdH — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 27, 2025 DeepSeek was able to achieve these phenomenal efficiency gains by implementing a few novel ideas: This brings us to the crux of the matter. At first glance, DeepSeek's R1 model appears to be a dark cloud for NVIDIA, questioning the need for hundreds of thousands of top-notch GPUs when an effective model can be trained with just 2000 H800s, as was the case with R1. However, a Cantor Fitzgerald analyst disagrees. Cantor Fitzgerald: DeepSeek V3 is Actually Very Bullish for Compute and $NVDA: "Following release of DeepSeek's V3 LLM, there has been great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs. We think this view is farthest from the truth… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 27, 2025 Cantor Fitzgerald's investment note concedes at the outset that DeepSeek's R1 model has generated "great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs." However, the investment bank thinks this view is "farthest from the truth." We think this view is farthest from the truth and that the announcement is actually very bullish with AGI seemingly closer to reality and Jevons Paradox almost certainly leading to the AI industry wanting more compute, not less. Accordingly, the investment bank declares that it would be "buyers of NVIDIA shares on any potential weakness." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Jevons paradox posits that increased efficiency in utilizing a resource can lead to a greater consumption of that resource. Cantor Fitzgerald has applied the same reasoning towards DeepSeek's R1 model and the democratization of the AI moat. $NVDA The DeepSeek sell-off: Analyst Reactions:🔸 JPMorgan (Sandeep Deshpande): Suggests the AI investment cycle might be overhyped; DeepSeek's efficiency could lead to a more efficient future. 🔸 Jefferies (Edison Lee): Proposes two strategies post-DeepSeek: continue… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 27, 2025 Interestingly, analysts at Citi and Bernstein have adopted a similar bullish view on NVIDIA in light of DeepSeek's advances. However, Raymond James analysts believe the development bodes ill for "large GPU clusters." Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: It’s Monday, January 27. Why haven’t you written about DeepSeek yet? I did! I wrote about R1 last Tuesday. I totally forgot about that. I take responsibility. I stand by the post, including the two biggest takeaways that I highlighted (emergent chain-of-thought via pure reinforcement learning, and the power of distillation), and I mentioned the low cost (which I expanded on in Sharp Tech) and chip ban implications, but those observations were too localized to the current state of the art in AI. What I totally failed to anticipate were the broader implications this news would have to the overall meta-discussion, particularly in terms of the U.S. and China. Is there precedent for such a miss? There is. In September 2023 Huawei announced the Mate 60 Pro with a SMIC-manufactured 7nm chip. The existence of this chip wasn’t a surprise for those paying close attention: SMIC had made a 7nm chip a year earlier (the existence of which I had noted even earlier than that), and TSMC had shipped 7nm chips in volume using nothing but DUV lithography (later iterations of 7nm were the first to use EUV). Intel had also made 10nm (TSMC 7nm equivalent) chips years earlier using nothing but DUV, but couldn’t do so with profitable yields; the idea that SMIC could ship 7nm chips using their existing equipment, particularly if they didn’t care about yields, wasn’t remotely surprising — to me, anyways. What I totally failed to anticipate was the overwrought reaction in Washington D.C. The dramatic expansion in the chip ban that culminated in the Biden administration transforming chip sales to a permission-based structure was downstream from people not understanding the intricacies of chip production, and being totally blindsided by the Huawei Mate 60 Pro. I get the sense that something similar has happened over the last 72 hours: the details of what DeepSeek has accomplished — and what they have not — are less important than the reaction and what that reaction says about people’s pre-existing assumptions. So what did DeepSeek announce? The most proximate announcement to this weekend’s meltdown was R1, a reasoning model that is similar to OpenAI’s o1. However, many of the revelations that contributed to the meltdown — including DeepSeek’s training costs — actually accompanied the V3 announcement over Christmas. Moreover, many of the breakthroughs that undergirded V3 were actually revealed with the release of the V2 model last January. Is this model naming convention the greatest crime that OpenAI has committed? Second greatest; we’ll get to the greatest momentarily. Let’s work backwards: what was the V2 model, and why was it important? The DeepSeek-V2 model introduced two important breakthroughs: DeepSeekMoE and DeepSeekMLA. The “MoE” in DeepSeekMoE refers to “mixture of experts”. Some models, like GPT-3.5, activate the entire model during both training and inference; it turns out, however, that not every part of the model is necessary for the topic at hand. MoE splits the model into multiple “experts” and only activates the ones that are necessary; GPT-4 was a MoE model that was believed to have 16 experts with approximately 110 billion parameters each. DeepSeekMoE, as implemented in V2, introduced important innovations on this concept, including differentiating between more finely-grained specialized experts, and shared experts with more generalized capabilities. Critically, DeepSeekMoE also introduced new approaches to load-balancing and routing during training; traditionally MoE increased communications overhead in training in exchange for efficient inference, but DeepSeek’s approach made training more efficient as well. DeepSeekMLA was an even bigger breakthrough. One of the biggest limitations on inference is the sheer amount of memory required: you both need to load the model into memory and also load the entire context window. Context windows are particularly expensive in terms of memory, as every token requires both a key and corresponding value; DeepSeekMLA, or multi-head latent attention, makes it possible to compress the key-value store, dramatically decreasing memory usage during inference. I’m not sure I understood any of that. The key implications of these breakthroughs — and the part you need to understand — only became apparent with V3, which added a new approach to load balancing (further reducing communications overhead) and multi-token prediction in training (further densifying each training step, again reducing overhead): V3 was shockingly cheap to train. DeepSeek claimed the model training took 2,788 thousand H800 GPU hours, which, at a cost of $2/GPU hour, comes out to a mere $5.576 million. That seems impossibly low. DeepSeek is clear that these costs are only for the final training run, and exclude all other expenses; from the V3 paper: Lastly, we emphasize again the economical training costs of DeepSeek-V3, summarized in Table 1, achieved through our optimized co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware. During the pre-training stage, training DeepSeek-V3 on each trillion tokens requires only 180K H800 GPU hours, i.e., 3.7 days on our cluster with 2048 H800 GPUs. Consequently, our pre- training stage is completed in less than two months and costs 2664K GPU hours. Combined with 119K GPU hours for the context length extension and 5K GPU hours for post-training, DeepSeek-V3 costs only 2.788M GPU hours for its full training. Assuming the rental price of the H800 GPU is $2 per GPU hour, our total training costs amount to only $5.576M. Note that the aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data. So no, you can’t replicate DeepSeek the company for $5.576 million. I still don’t believe that number. Actually, the burden of proof is on the doubters, at least once you understand the V3 architecture. Remember that bit about DeepSeekMoE: V3 has 671 billion parameters, but only 37 billion parameters in the active expert are computed per token; this equates to 333.3 billion FLOPs of compute per token. Here I should mention another DeepSeek innovation: while parameters were stored with BF16 or FP32 precision, they were reduced to FP8 precision for calculations; 2048 H800 GPUs have a capacity of 3.97 exoflops, i.e. 3.97 billion billion FLOPS. The training set, meanwhile, consisted of 14.8 trillion tokens; once you do all of the math it becomes apparent that 2.8 million H800 hours is sufficient for training V3. Again, this was just the final run, not the total cost, but it’s a plausible number. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang said they have 50,000 H100s. I don’t know where Wang got his information; I’m guessing he’s referring to this November 2024 tweet from Dylan Patel, which says that DeepSeek had “over 50k Hopper GPUs”. H800s, however, are Hopper GPUs, they just have much more constrained memory bandwidth than H100s because of U.S. sanctions. Here’s the thing: a huge number of the innovations I explained above are about overcoming the lack of memory bandwidth implied in using H800s instead of H100s. Moreover, if you actually did the math on the previous question, you would realize that DeepSeek actually had an excess of computing; that’s because DeepSeek actually programmed 20 of the 132 processing units on each H800 specifically to manage cross-chip communications. This is actually impossible to do in CUDA. DeepSeek engineers had to drop down to PTX, a low-level instruction set for Nvidia GPUs that is basically like assembly language. This is an insane level of optimization that only makes sense if you are using H800s. Meanwhile, DeepSeek also makes their models available for inference: that requires a whole bunch of GPUs above-and-beyond whatever was used for training. So was this a violation of the chip ban? Nope. H100s were prohibited by the chip ban, but not H800s. Everyone assumed that training leading edge models required more interchip memory bandwidth, but that is exactly what DeepSeek optimized both their model structure and infrastructure around. Again, just to emphasize this point, all of the decisions DeepSeek made in the design of this model only make sense if you are constrained to the H800; if DeepSeek had access to H100s, they probably would have used a larger training cluster with much fewer optimizations specifically focused on overcoming the lack of bandwidth. So V3 is a leading edge model? It’s definitely competitive with OpenAI’s 4o and Anthropic’s Sonnet-3.5, and appears to be better than Llama’s biggest model. What does seem likely is that DeepSeek was able to distill those models to give V3 high quality tokens to train on. What is distillation? Distillation is a means of extracting understanding from another model; you can send inputs to the teacher model and record the outputs, and use that to train the student model. This is how you get models like GPT-4 Turbo from GPT-4. Distillation is easier for a company to do on its own models, because they have full access, but you can still do distillation in a somewhat more unwieldy way via API, or even, if you get creative, via chat clients. Distillation obviously violates the terms of service of various models, but the only way to stop it is to actually cut off access, via IP banning, rate limiting, etc. It’s assumed to be widespread in terms of model training, and is why there are an ever-increasing number of models converging on GPT-4o quality. This doesn’t mean that we know for a fact that DeepSeek distilled 4o or Claude, but frankly, it would be odd if they didn’t. Distillation seems terrible for leading edge models. It is! On the positive side, OpenAI and Anthropic and Google are almost certainly using distillation to optimize the models they use for inference for their consumer-facing apps; on the negative side, they are effectively bearing the entire cost of training the leading edge, while everyone else is free-riding on their investment. Indeed, this is probably the core economic factor undergirding the slow divorce of Microsoft and OpenAI. Microsoft is interested in providing inference to its customers, but much less enthused about funding $100 billion data centers to train leading edge models that are likely to be commoditized long before that $100 billion is depreciated. Is this why all of the Big Tech stock prices are down? In the long run, model commoditization and cheaper inference — which DeepSeek has also demonstrated — is great for Big Tech. A world where Microsoft gets to provide inference to its customers for a fraction of the cost means that Microsoft has to spend less on data centers and GPUs, or, just as likely, sees dramatically higher usage given that inference is so much cheaper. Another big winner is Amazon: AWS has by-and-large failed to make their own quality model, but that doesn’t matter if there are very high quality open source models that they can serve at far lower costs than expected. Apple is also a big winner. Dramatically decreased memory requirements for inference make edge inference much more viable, and Apple has the best hardware for exactly that. Apple Silicon uses unified memory, which means that the CPU, GPU, and NPU (neural processing unit) have access to a shared pool of memory; this means that Apple’s high-end hardware actually has the best consumer chip for inference (Nvidia gaming GPUs max out at 32GB of VRAM, while Apple’s chips go up to 192 GB of RAM). Meta, meanwhile, is the biggest winner of all. I already laid out last fall how every aspect of Meta’s business benefits from AI; a big barrier to realizing that vision is the cost of inference, which means that dramatically cheaper inference — and dramatically cheaper training, given the need for Meta to stay on the cutting edge — makes that vision much more achievable. Google, meanwhile, is probably in worse shape: a world of decreased hardware requirements lessens the relative advantage they have from TPUs. More importantly, a world of zero-cost inference increases the viability and likelihood of products that displace search; granted, Google gets lower costs as well, but any change from the status quo is probably a net negative. I asked why the stock prices are down; you just painted a positive picture! My picture is of the long run; today is the short run, and it seems likely the market is working through the shock of R1’s existence. Wait, you haven’t even talked about R1 yet. R1 is a reasoning model like OpenAI’s o1. It has the ability to think through a problem, producing much higher quality results, particularly in areas like coding, math, and logic (but I repeat myself). Is this more impressive than V3? Actually, the reason why I spent so much time on V3 is that that was the model that actually demonstrated a lot of the dynamics that seem to be generating so much surprise and controversy. R1 is notable, however, because o1 stood alone as the only reasoning model on the market, and the clearest sign that OpenAI was the market leader. R1 undoes the o1 mythology in a couple of important ways. First, there is the fact that it exists. OpenAI does not have some sort of special sauce that can’t be replicated. Second, R1 — like all of DeepSeek’s models — has open weights (the problem with saying “open source” is that we don’t have the data that went into creating it). This means that instead of paying OpenAI to get reasoning, you can run R1 on the server of your choice, or even locally, at dramatically lower cost. How did DeepSeek make R1? DeepSeek actually made two models: R1 and R1-Zero. I actually think that R1-Zero is the bigger deal; as I noted above, it was my biggest focus in last Tuesday’s Update: R1-Zero, though, is the bigger deal in my mind. From the paper: In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. Reinforcement learning is a technique where a machine learning model is given a bunch of data and a reward function. The classic example is AlphaGo, where DeepMind gave the model the rules of Go with the reward function of winning the game, and then let the model figure everything else on its own. This famously ended up working better than other more human-guided techniques. LLMs to date, however, have relied on reinforcement learning with human feedback; humans are in the loop to help guide the model, navigate difficult choices where rewards aren’t obvious, etc. RLHF was the key innovation in transforming GPT-3 into ChatGPT, with well-formed paragraphs, answers that were concise and didn’t trail off into gibberish, etc. R1-Zero, however, drops the HF part — it’s just reinforcement learning. DeepSeek gave the model a set of math, code, and logic questions, and set two reward functions: one for the right answer, and one for the right format that utilized a thinking process. Moreover, the technique was a simple one: instead of trying to evaluate step-by-step (process supervision), or doing a search of all possible answers (a la AlphaGo), DeepSeek encouraged the model to try several different answers at a time and then graded them according to the two reward functions. What emerged is a model that developed reasoning and chains-of-thought on its own, including what DeepSeek called “Aha Moments”: A particularly intriguing phenomenon observed during the training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is the occurrence of an “aha moment”. This moment, as illustrated in Table 3, occurs in an intermediate version of the model. During this phase, DeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial approach. This behavior is not only a testament to the model’s growing reasoning abilities but also a captivating example of how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and sophisticated outcomes. This moment is not only an “aha moment” for the model but also for the researchers observing its behavior. It underscores the power and beauty of reinforcement learning: rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies. The “aha moment” serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of intelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in the future. This is one of the most powerful affirmations yet of The Bitter Lesson: you don’t need to teach the AI how to reason, you can just give it enough compute and data and it will teach itself! Well, almost: R1-Zero reasons, but in a way that humans have trouble understanding. Back to the introduction: However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217. This sounds a lot like what OpenAI did for o1: DeepSeek started the model out with a bunch of examples of chain-of-thought thinking so it could learn the proper format for human consumption, and then did the reinforcement learning to enhance its reasoning, along with a number of editing and refinement steps; the output is a model that appears to be very competitive with o1. Here again it seems plausible that DeepSeek benefited from distillation, particularly in terms of training R1. That, though, is itself an important takeaway: we have a situation where AI models are teaching AI models, and where AI models are teaching themselves. We are watching the assembly of an AI takeoff scenario in realtime. So are we close to AGI? It definitely seems like it. This also explains why Softbank (and whatever investors Masayoshi Son brings together) would provide the funding for OpenAI that Microsoft will not: the belief that we are reaching a takeoff point where there will in fact be real returns towards being first. But isn’t R1 now in the lead? I don’t think so; this has been overstated. R1 is competitive with o1, although there do seem to be some holes in its capability that point towards some amount of distillation from o1-Pro. OpenAI, meanwhile, has demonstrated o3, a far more powerful reasoning model. DeepSeek is absolutely the leader in efficiency, but that is different than being the leader overall. So why is everyone freaking out? I think there are multiple factors. First, there is the shock that China has caught up to the leading U.S. labs, despite the widespread assumption that China isn’t as good at software as the U.S.. This is probably the biggest thing I missed in my surprise over the reaction. The reality is that China has an extremely proficient software industry generally, and a very good track record in AI model building specifically. Second is the low training cost for V3, and DeepSeek’s low inference costs. This part was a big surprise for me as well, to be sure, but the numbers are plausible. This, by extension, probably has everyone nervous about Nvidia, which obviously has a big impact on the market. Third is the fact that DeepSeek pulled this off despite the chip ban. Again, though, while there are big loopholes in the chip ban, it seems likely to me that DeepSeek accomplished this with legal chips. I own Nvidia! Am I screwed? There are real challenges this news presents to the Nvidia story. Nvidia has two big moats: These two moats work together. I noted above that if DeepSeek had access to H100s they probably would have used a larger cluster to train their model, simply because that would have been the easier option; the fact they didn’t, and were bandwidth constrained, drove a lot of their decisions in terms of both model architecture and their training infrastructure. Just look at the U.S. labs: they haven’t spent much time on optimization because Nvidia has been aggressively shipping ever more capable systems that accommodate their needs. The route of least resistance has simply been to pay Nvidia. DeepSeek, however, just demonstrated that another route is available: heavy optimization can produce remarkable results on weaker hardware and with lower memory bandwidth; simply paying Nvidia more isn’t the only way to make better models. That noted, there are three factors still in Nvidia’s favor. First, how capable might DeepSeek’s approach be if applied to H100s, or upcoming GB100s? Just because they found a more efficient way to use compute doesn’t mean that more compute wouldn’t be useful. Second, lower inference costs should, in the long run, drive greater usage. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in a late night tweet almost assuredly directed at the market, said exactly that: Jevons paradox strikes again! As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of. https://t.co/omEcOPhdIz Third, reasoning models like R1 and o1 derive their superior performance from using more compute. To the extent that increasing the power and capabilities of AI depend on more compute is the extent that Nvidia stands to benefit! Still, it’s not all rosy. At a minimum DeepSeek’s efficiency and broad availability cast significant doubt on the most optimistic Nvidia growth story, at least in the near term. The payoffs from both model and infrastructure optimization also suggest there are significant gains to be had from exploring alternative approaches to inference in particular. For example, it might be much more plausible to run inference on a standalone AMD GPU, completely sidestepping AMD’s inferior chip-to-chip communications capability. Reasoning models also increase the payoff for inference-only chips that are even more specialized than Nvidia’s GPUs. In short, Nvidia isn’t going anywhere; the Nvidia stock, however, is suddenly facing a lot more uncertainty that hasn’t been priced in. And that, by extension, is going to drag everyone down. So what about the chip ban? The easiest argument to make is that the importance of the chip ban has only been accentuated given the U.S.’s rapidly evaporating lead in software. Software and knowhow can’t be embargoed — we’ve had these debates and realizations before — but chips are physical objects and the U.S. is justified in keeping them away from China. At the same time, there should be some humility about the fact that earlier iterations of the chip ban seem to have directly led to DeepSeek’s innovations. Those innovations, moreover, would extend to not just smuggled Nvidia chips or nerfed ones like the H800, but to Huawei’s Ascend chips as well. Indeed, you can very much make the case that the primary outcome of the chip ban is today’s crash in Nvidia’s stock price. What concerns me is the mindset undergirding something like the chip ban: instead of competing through innovation in the future the U.S. is competing through the denial of innovation in the past. Yes, this may help in the short term — again, DeepSeek would be even more effective with more computing — but in the long run it simply sews the seeds for competition in an industry — chips and semiconductor equipment — over which the U.S. has a dominant position. Like AI models? AI models are a great example. I mentioned above I would get to OpenAI’s greatest crime, which I consider to be the 2023 Biden Executive Order on AI. I wrote in Attenuating Innovation: The point is this: if you accept the premise that regulation locks in incumbents, then it sure is notable that the early AI winners seem the most invested in generating alarm in Washington, D.C. about AI. This despite the fact that their concern is apparently not sufficiently high to, you know, stop their work. No, they are the responsible ones, the ones who care enough to call for regulation; all the better if concerns about imagined harms kneecap inevitable competitors. That paragraph was about OpenAI specifically, and the broader San Francisco AI community generally. For years now we have been subject to hand-wringing about the dangers of AI by the exact same people committed to building it — and controlling it. These alleged dangers were the impetus for OpenAI becoming closed back in 2019 with the release of GPT-2: Due to concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased, or abusive language at scale, we are only releasing a much smaller version of GPT-2 along with sampling code⁠(opens in a new window). We are not releasing the dataset, training code, or GPT-2 model weights…We are aware that some researchers have the technical capacity to reproduce and open source our results. We believe our release strategy limits the initial set of organizations who may choose to do this, and gives the AI community more time to have a discussion about the implications of such systems. We also think governments should consider expanding or commencing initiatives to more systematically monitor the societal impact and diffusion of AI technologies, and to measure the progression in the capabilities of such systems. If pursued, these efforts could yield a better evidence base for decisions by AI labs and governments regarding publication decisions and AI policy more broadly. The arrogance in this statement is only surpassed by the futility: here we are six years later, and the entire world has access to the weights of a dramatically superior model. OpenAI’s gambit for control — enforced by the U.S. government — has utterly failed. In the meantime, how much innovation has been foregone by virtue of leading edge models not having open weights? More generally, how much time and energy has been spent lobbying for a government-enforced moat that DeepSeek just obliterated, that would have been better devoted to actual innovation? So you’re not worried about AI doom scenarios? I definitely understand the concern, and just noted above that we are reaching the stage where AIs are training AIs and learning reasoning on their own. I recognize, though, that there is no stopping this train. More than that, this is exactly why openness is so important: we need more AIs in the world, not an unaccountable board ruling all of us. Wait, why is China open-sourcing their model? Well DeepSeek is, to be clear; CEO Liang Wenfeng said in a must-read interview that open source is key to attracting talent: In the face of disruptive technologies, moats created by closed source are temporary. Even OpenAI’s closed source approach can’t prevent others from catching up. So we anchor our value in our team — our colleagues grow through this process, accumulate know-how, and form an organization and culture capable of innovation. That’s our moat. Open source, publishing papers, in fact, do not cost us anything. For technical talent, having others follow your innovation gives a great sense of accomplishment. In fact, open source is more of a cultural behavior than a commercial one, and contributing to it earns us respect. There is also a cultural attraction for a company to do this. The interviewer asked if this would change: DeepSeek, right now, has a kind of idealistic aura reminiscent of the early days of OpenAI, and it’s open source. Will you change to closed source later on? Both OpenAI and Mistral moved from open-source to closed-source. We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem first is more important. This actually makes sense beyond idealism. If models are commodities — and they are certainly looking that way — then long-term differentiation comes from having a superior cost structure; that is exactly what DeepSeek has delivered, which itself is resonant of how China has come to dominate other industries. This is also contrary to how most U.S. companies think about differentiation, which is through having differentiated products that can sustain larger margins. So is OpenAI screwed? Not necessarily. ChatGPT made OpenAI the accidental consumer tech company, which is to say a product company; there is a route to building a sustainable consumer business on commoditizable models through some combination of subscriptions and advertisements. And, of course, there is the bet on winning the race to AI take-off. Anthropic, on the other hand, is probably the biggest loser of the weekend. DeepSeek made it to number one in the App Store, simply highlighting how Claude, in contrast, hasn’t gotten any traction outside of San Francisco. The API business is doing better, but API businesses in general are the most susceptible to the commoditization trends that seem inevitable (and do note that OpenAI and Anthropic’s inference costs look a lot higher than DeepSeek because they were capturing a lot of margin; that’s going away). So this is all pretty depressing, then? Actually, no. I think that DeepSeek has provided a massive gift to nearly everyone. The biggest winners are consumers and businesses who can anticipate a future of effectively-free AI products and services. Jevons Paradox will rule the day in the long run, and everyone who uses AI will be the biggest winners. Another set of winners are the big consumer tech companies. A world of free AI is a world where product and distribution matters most, and those companies already won that game; The End of the Beginning was right. China is also a big winner, in ways that I suspect will only become apparent over time. Not only does the country have access to DeepSeek, but I suspect that DeepSeek’s relative success to America’s leading AI labs will result in a further unleashing of Chinese innovation as they realize they can compete. That leaves America, and a choice we have to make. We could, for very logical reasons, double down on defensive measures, like massively expanding the chip ban and imposing a permission-based regulatory regime on chips and semiconductor equipment that mirrors the E.U.’s approach to tech; alternatively, we could realize that we have real competition, and actually give ourself permission to compete. Stop wringing our hands, stop campaigning for regulations — indeed, go the other way, and cut out all of the cruft in our companies that has nothing to do with winning. If we choose to compete we can still win, and, if we do, we will have a Chinese company to thank. I wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 6:01:30 AM PST by MtnClimber "Sustainability" investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn't just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being "nice." Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, "All investments are going to be looked through sustainability." But "sustainability" is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet UN sustainability goals of "nutrition" and "sanitation" by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as "Beyond Petroleum." Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created "sustainability investment funds," claiming "sustainability factors ... actually enhance returns!" His funds did enhance Gore's own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his "sustainable" fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they "made investment mistakes." Most funds promoting "sustainable investment" did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? "Because of pressures," says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. "Their largest clients are blue states' pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: 'Adopt these agendas or you're going to lose us as your largest customer!'" CalPERS still brags about "mitigating climate risk" and adding "climate-conscious board members" to Exxon's board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: "They will invest into climate-related efforts," he intoned. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. "What you're seeing," says Cole, "is ESG funds shuttering at record speed ... and they're not apologizing." Progressives never do. This fad didn't just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel's competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about "sustainability." Intel's website lists endless ESG goals like "environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet." It even brags about "green software" ... whatever that is. That's a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. Intel's stock fell 60% last year...SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Society KEYWORDS: wokeism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:01:30 AM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber When companies spend time sucking up to LEFTIST politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:02:11 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

He created "sustainability investment funds," claiming "sustainability factors ... actually enhance returns!" His funds did enhance Gore's own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his "sustainable" fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they "made investment mistakes." Most funds promoting "sustainable investment" did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? "Because of pressures," says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. "Their largest clients are blue states' pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: 'Adopt these agendas or you're going to lose us as your largest customer!'" CalPERS still brags about "mitigating climate risk" and adding "climate-conscious board members" to Exxon's board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: "They will invest into climate-related efforts," he intoned. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. "What you're seeing," says Cole, "is ESG funds shuttering at record speed ... and they're not apologizing." Progressives never do. This fad didn't just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel's competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about "sustainability." Intel's website lists endless ESG goals like "environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet." It even brags about "green software" ... whatever that is. That's a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline.

Title: Bitcoin briefly falls below $100,000 as China AI threat sparks stock market rout

Bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000 early Monday as a global technology stock sell-off rattled markets to start the week. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was down 3.51% as of Monday morning, bringing its price to $101,295 apiece. That was a recovery from a low of about $97,900 earlier in the day. Bitcoin has been boosted in recent months by President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, which first sent the popular coin above $100,000 last month in the aftermath of his election victory. Last week, Trump signed an executive order that set the stage for industry-friendly regulations and a national cryptocurrency stockpile — key campaign promises he made to the industry. But Bitcoin isn’t immune from other market turmoil. Contracts for all three major U.S. indices fell tumbled Monday morning as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Futures of the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged more than 800 points, or roughly 4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA+6.73%), were also down more than 300 points as of Monday morning. S&P 500 futures tumbled 2%. The sell-off was prompted by DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model rivaling OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+3.08%) Llama 3.1 built using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. In December, the private company launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” Investors are also awaiting the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Wednesday. Fed policymakers are expected to hold rates steady following this week’s meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The Fed reduced rates by a full percentage point in the span of three months last year, bringing the benchmark federal funds rate to 4.25%-4.50%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled a more cautious approach to interest rates this year, as concerns about balancing rising inflation with the strong labor market persist. “As for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market,” Powell said in a news conference following the committee’s December meeting. “And as long as the economy and the labor market are solid, we can be cautious as we consider further cuts.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 3% Monday afternoon as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA), went up 109 points or 0.2% as of Monday afternoon. Moreover, the S&P 500 tumbled by 1.8%. The Nasdaq, which has been significantly boosted by AI hype, is especially susceptible to any investor concerns, especially when it comes to AI. And the rise of any competitor to U.S. dominance in the space, especially one that uses less energy and has less of a need for high-end chips, can cause fears to spike. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company said it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store over the weekend. Most notably, DeepSeek built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings.

Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). “U.S. tech companies are trading at premium valuations, with major AI players like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) commanding forward [price-to-earnings] multiples far above historical averages,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment platform Saxo, in a statement. “With these stocks priced for perfection, even minor disruptions, such as DeepSeek proving advanced AI can be built without top-tier chips, could weigh heavily on share prices.” Analysts at Wedbush said DeepSeek is not yet a real threat to U.S. hyperscalers, and could prompt further capital expenditure from major firms like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, and Microsoft. This week, significant earnings reports are due from big tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT).

Title: Nvidia stock plunges 14% as a big advance by China's DeepSeek rattles AI investors

Nvidia (NVDA) stock plunged 16% Monday afternoon after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek’s latest model raised questions about American competitiveness in the AI space. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. And last week, the company said it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store over the weekend. Most notably, DeepSeek built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” Read more: The Nasdaq sinks more than 800 points as a China AI threat sparks a huge tech stock sell-off Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). “U.S. tech companies are trading at premium valuations, with major AI players like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) commanding forward [price-to-earnings] multiples far above historical averages,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment platform Saxo, in a statement. “With these stocks priced for perfection, even minor disruptions, such as DeepSeek proving advanced AI can be built without top-tier chips, could weigh heavily on share prices.” With the end goal of AI being artificial general intelligence (AGI) — and with U.S. companies well on their way to achieve it within the coming years — Wedbush analysts believe Monday’s investor jitters may be overblown. “While the model is impressive and it will have a ripple impact,” they said, “the reality is that Mag 7 and US tech is focused on the AGI endgame with all the infrastructure and ecosystem that China and especially DeepSeek cannot come close to in our view.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares of AI companies – which have driven the market in recent months – tumbled amid concerns about a possible lower-cost AI competitor in China. The potential pullback could come after the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted two straight winning weeks. The broad-based S&P hit an intraday record on Friday. Earnings will shape the market this week, as more than half of the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks will post results. The Federal Reserve will also announce its latest policy decision Wednesday. Follow live market updates. Shares of AI-linked tech companies including Nvidia, Broadcom and Microsoft fell in premarket trading as investors digested the capabilities of the Chinese startup DeepSeek. The company claims it developed the open-source large-language model it launched in December for only $6 million – a small fraction of the billions U.S. tech companies are spending on AI. Its reasoning model released last week reportedly outperformed OpenAI on several third-party tests. JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande explained the concern in a note, writing: "Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek's highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible." The concerns over U.S. tech stocks come during a week when many of the sector's key companies will report earnings. Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla will all post results. Outside of tech, other major companies reporting include General Motors, Boeing, Starbucks, Comcast, Chevron and Exxon Mobil. Here are the key results to watch this week: The first potential trade war of the second Trump administration ended before it really started. The White House delayed threatened 25% tariffs on Colombian goods after it said the South American nation reversed course and agreed to accept U.S. military flights carrying deported migrants. While Colombia is not one of the main U.S. trading partners, it is the second largest provider of coffee to the U.S., and is a major crude oil exporter. Investors and consumers are still waiting to see whether President Donald Trump will slap tariffs on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican goods. While Trump has had a friendly ties with many business sectors, his relationship with pharmaceutical companies hasn't always been smooth. The industry hopes that will change during Trump's second term in office. Executives are eager to see whether the White House tries to reform the insurance middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers. They are also watching to see whether Trump or the Republican Congress try to make any changes to Medicare drug price negotiations with Congress.

Title: The Tempi tragedy, the truth, Putin, Tsipras at the Kremlin, and how we ended up empty-handed (a true story), National Insurance, and Maris

Time Published: 2025-01-27T12:51:15Z

Greetings. A comment on yesterday’s very large gatherings for Tempi, given the time of year we’re in.The train accident that claimed the lives of 57 young people is an event that will always shock, move, and enrage public opinion because everyone relates to the tragedy of those 57 families, imagining that it could have been their own child. That’s why the Justice system must do its job properly. Personally, I can’t believe that any judge would fail to perform their duties in a case involving such a tragedy. Beyond that, the families of the lost children deserve nothing but respect, regardless of what they say or believe, as do the thousands of ordinary people who stand by them with genuine feelings of grief and inexpressible pain. However, when politicians and professional unionists—especially those from the two other parties that governed for years and shaped the image of a broken railway system riddled with political favors—step in, there’s a limit to what one can tolerate. I would have expected the mainstream opposition, especially PASOK, to use the Tempi anniversary and the massive gatherings as an opportunity to demand from the government a genuine investigation into the current state of the railway system so that we all know whether the necessary measures have been taken to prevent another tragic accident. As for SYRIZA, which attended the gathering, it would have been good if they had shown up to the gatherings for the Mati wildfire victims—which, of course, never happened for reasons we all understand. Ten Years Since “First Time Left”A few days ago marked ten years since the “First Time Left” government, with a sprinkle of far-right nationalism (courtesy of Panos Kammenos’ “Fatherland – Religion – Family” rhetoric), came to power with its well-documented consequences for the country. These have been analyzed extensively by journalists like us, as well as by politicians, historians, etc. Today, I’ll share with you an unknown incident from that chaotic period, particularly the first year, 2015, when the SYRIZA-ANEL government was scrambling to find money to break Greece’s chains from the Western creditors. This, of course, turned out to be utterly impossible and utopian, despite the legendary front-page headline of the late Kouris that read: “All of Europe Hangs on Alexis’ Heavy Balls,” with a subheading: “Tsipras Took Them Out, Weighed Them, and Is Ready to Show Them.” Before Tsipras could “show them,” however, he needed to find money because, as we all know, people can’t live on “heavy balls” alone, as the iconic headline suggested. So the SYRIZA people first went to the Chinese, who told them they could only lend a hundred million euros—an amount that wouldn’t even cover a week’s expenses, considering that Europeans and Americans collectively loaned Greece about 350 billion euros. At the Kremlin with PutinSo, the government turned to Russia, and the great Lafazanis, then Minister of Energy, assured Alexis that all it would take was a visit and a one-on-one meeting with “Father Putin,” and Mother Russia would open her endless purse strings and drown Greece in cash, freeing the people from the oppressive European creditors. And so, the leader (perhaps naively) agreed, and a meeting was arranged—under the guise of discussing energy cooperation—at the Kremlin between Vladimir and Alexis. Someone familiar with the content of the meeting recounts that Putin immediately left Tsipras speechless, giving him no wiggle room by explaining from the start that, yes, Russia is a great power, but it doesn’t have the ability to lend such enormous amounts to any country, let alone Greece. He also explained that politically, Russia couldn’t intervene in a country within another sphere of influence, reminding the Greek prime minister of something like: “Big guy, Churchill and Stalin settled these matters on a napkin at the end of World War II.” We’re Besties with Angela…What’s even more intriguing is what Putin told Tsipras at the end of their conversation, along with his rejection of the financial request. Reportedly, the Russian president told him: “Apart from everything else, you know, Alexis, Angela and I have an excellent relationship, and I wouldn’t want to spoil it!” Putin’s statement became even clearer years later, during the Ukraine war, when it was revealed that Germany had been receiving Russian natural gas at half-price during Angela Merkel’s chancellorship. But there’s more: the Russian president is said to have done something even more shocking. A few hours after the meeting, he allegedly called Merkel and ratted out the Greeks for coming to him asking for money. Needless to say, I can only imagine what Lafazanis heard from Tsipras afterward and how lucky we are to have avoided what could have been. Today, we’re here writing stories instead of living them. Banks Await Ratings Verdict After InterviewsAfter recently being interviewed by the rating agency S&P, Greek banks are awaiting their verdict (expected later this month or early next month). The evaluation will concern only the banks and not the Greek state, as the agency has scheduled April 18 as the date for assessing the national economy. National Insurance: Sale of Syngrou Building Postponed – Low OffersThe management of National Insurance evaluated the offers received for the sale of its property on Syngrou Avenue and decided to shelve them. Although the company remains committed to selling this prime asset, it is not willing to agree to a price lower than what it believes the property is worth. This decision indicates that the insurer does not currently face liquidity needs. It also reflects that the offers were below the valuation threshold the company had set. Meanwhile, renovations of the company’s building on Karageorgi Servias Street are progressing to accommodate employees currently based on Syngrou Avenue back in central Athens. Among other things, this means that if the desired price for the Syngrou property takes time to materialize, the insurer could explore alternative ways to commercially utilize the property. It seems that, at least for now, the acquisition of Open by Dimitris Maris has not progressed, as Savvidis’ side has stated—yet again—that the channel is not for sale. However, Dimitris Maris, who the market believes has relocated to New York (though reliable friends tell me he’s currently residing in Filopappou), appears determined to intensify his business activity in Greece. He is already active in betting companies and media (owning news247.gr and sports24.gr). Last Friday, January 24, the company Deep Capital Holding S.A. was established, headquartered on Vasilissis Sofias Avenue, specializing in “portfolio management services”—essentially a holding company designed to host a variety of ventures. The initial share capital amounts to €700,000, corresponding to 70,000 shares of €10 each, fully contributed by Dimitris Maris. The first Board of Directors consists of Maris as Chairman and Alexandros Chatzopoulos and Polytimi Dalamanga as members. Polytimi Dalamanga is a long-time collaborator of Maris, while lawyer Alexandros Chatzopoulos joined Deep Capital Group in November 2022 as General Manager of Corporate Affairs. In the past, Chatzopoulos has held senior positions at Philip Morris International, Papastratos, and SEV (the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises). Earlier, from 2009 to 2011, he served as a strategic planning and communications advisor in the office of Prime Minister George Papandreou. Evidently, this new company serves as an “extension” of Dimitris Maris’ Deep Capital Group, which operates in over 10 countries, with investments in Kaizen Gaming, 24 Media Participations, and other businesses, focusing on technology, media, and real estate sectors. In a special ceremony to be held today, the Senate of the University of Piraeus will confer an honorary doctorate on Christos Megalou, CEO of Piraeus Bank. The collaboration between the bank and the university runs deep, as they jointly created the first postgraduate program specializing in Sustainable Development: the “MBA in Sustainability powered by Piraeus.” This program is offered tuition-free and is coordinated by the university’s Department of Business Organization and Management, having launched last October. The Frankfurt-listed construction group Hochtief has long been absent from pursuing new major concessions or PPP contracts in Greece. Two months ago, the German-origin group struck a deal with its partners in the Olympia Odos consortium (Vinci, AVAX, GEK TERNA, and AKTOR) to sell its 17% stake in the “Olympia Odos” for €100 million. This places the total valuation of the concession at around €600 million—equivalent to what GEK TERNA estimates it will earn annually from its two major concessions, Attiki Odos and Egnatia Odos. Hochtief operates across Europe, North America, and Australia. Since 2007, the Spanish construction giant ACS has held a 75.7% stake in the company. Rumors suggest that the Spaniards and Germans no longer see a competitive edge in the Greek market. Consequently, there is growing speculation that Hochtief’s next move will be to sell its 38.89% stake in the “Aegean Motorway” consortium. In this consortium, Hochtief holds the largest share, followed by AVAX (23.61%), AKTOR Concessions (22%), and the French group Vinci Concessions (15.18%). In recent weeks, fresh money has been pouring into the stock market, with existing players strengthening their positions, resulting in record-breaking milestones. The General Index hit a new 14-year high, aiming for the 1,550-point mark—last seen on April 7, 2011. Similarly, the FTSE 25/Large Cap index and the Mid Cap index are at 11- and 15-year highs, respectively. Among individual stocks, PPC (Public Power Corporation) reached a 15-year high, climbing to €13.14 during the trading day before closing at €12.95—the best closing price since August 19, 2010. National Bank of Greece matched its previous record of €8.52 from May 20, 2024, with further gains taking it back to November 27, 2015, when it reached €12.1. Piraeus Bank achieved a 4-year record, surpassing €4.4 and hitting its highest level since April 2021. Meanwhile, IDEAL Holdings will soon brief analysts and shareholders on the details of its Barba Stathis acquisition. This week, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the European Central Bank on Thursday will announce decisions on interest rates for the US Dollar and the Euro, respectively. In the US, no rate cuts are expected. However, in Europe, political pressures on central bankers are immense. If Christine Lagarde cuts Euro interest rates, highly indebted businesses will breathe a sigh of relief. On the other hand, if rates remain unchanged, banks—already driving the rise in stock markets—stand to benefit. Meanwhile, Europe, particularly Italy, is seeing seismic shifts in banking acquisitions and mergers. After UniCredit delayed its merger with Commerzbank pending German election results, the third-largest Italian bank, Banco BPM, made a bid to acquire asset manager Anima Holding in November, only to become a target for acquisition by UniCredit shortly thereafter. Last week, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena upped the ante with a €13.3 billion offer to acquire competitor Mediobanca. The final chapter for Tupperware in Greece has been written! Despite being one of the profitable subsidiaries of the American group, the closure could not be averted due to the parent company’s heavy burdens. About a year after the closure of its factory in Greece, the company is now ceasing all operations in the country. The parent company has decided to dissolve and liquidate the Greek subsidiary, appointing two liquidators to oversee the process. One week from today, Attica Holdings will kick off its “Around the World in 80 Days” tour in London, aiming for a well-executed placement to boost stock liquidity and align with the new free-float rules set by the Athens Stock Exchange. Next Monday’s presentation, organized by UBS, Euroxx, and Piraeus Securities, will host about 30 London-based fund managers tasked with evaluating the Group’s growth prospects in light of Greece’s booming tourism sector. Ahead of the London meeting, Attica Group’s stock surged by 7.66% on Friday, closing at €2.39—raising the valuation of Greece’s largest passenger ferry company to €581.16 million. Today, the largest shareholder of Attica Group is STRIX Holdings L.P., which controls 25.4% directly and 61.3% indirectly through its subsidiary MIG Shipping S.A. Significant room exists to expand the shareholder base—provided the consultants give the green light this time. The next session of the European Council, set to take place at the Palais d’Egmont in Brussels, where EU leaders will discuss a unified European policy in response to the new Trump challenge, will mark the first Summit under the Polish Presidency of the EU. Beyond discussions on European Defense issues, new priorities for common industrial policy will also be on the agenda. At this juncture, Greece and Italy have developed a joint platform aimed at a “productive model transformation.” Greece’s Minister of Development, Takis Theodorikakos, along with his Italian counterpart, Minister of Entrepreneurship Adolfo Urso, have already submitted a joint proposal to the presiding Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, focusing on strengthening investments, bolstering industry, and financing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The timing of the Polish Presidency—following Hungary’s tumultuous and unproductive tenure—is especially critical, coinciding with the start of the EU’s new three-year funding period for 2025–2027. Greece has already submitted its own plan for transforming its productive model, while next Friday, the Greek Cabinet will include the issue of the Quality Strategy in its agenda. This marks an important legislative initiative for the National Quality System, which is a prerequisite and milestone for approving the sixth payment request from the Resilience and Recovery Fund. Last Saturday, President Trump visited Las Vegas for yet another “victory lap.” He addressed hundreds of enthusiastic supporters at the Circa Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. His first promise as the newly elected President was to fulfill his campaign pledge to abolish the tip taxes imposed during the Biden administration. “We’re going to get this done for you—no tax on tips,” Trump announced to a roaring crowd, standing behind a podium emblazoned with the same slogan used throughout his 2024 campaign. Trump’s message to Nevada’s hospitality workers was crystal clear: he intends to eliminate income taxes on tips. In Las Vegas, a 24/7 economy relies heavily on tips to support thousands of workers in the hospitality industry—from waiters and valets to hotel housekeepers, hairstylists, taxi drivers, and countless others. Nevada has the highest concentration of workers in this sector, with approximately 25.8 waiters and waitresses per 1,000 jobs, followed by Hawaii and Florida. By pledging to abolish tipping taxes, Trump managed to secure electoral victories in all these states. Interestingly, this issue also seems to resonate in Greece, where the Ministry of Finance is closely monitoring Trump’s March legislation to draw inspiration for its own fiscal reforms. One of the main reasons all the CEOs of the tech giants on the U.S. West Coast have openly supported Donald Trump (he even confided a few days ago that Elon Musk spearheaded his campaign in Pennsylvania!) is the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and the immense power these tech titans aim to harness by controlling AI. A striking example is Mark Zuckerberg’s interview, which was extensively covered in a New York Times feature, outlining how he plans to eliminate lower-tier programming positions at Meta. Essentially, the founder of Facebook signaled the dawn of a new labor market—one far more employer-friendly. But then, the unexpected happened. On Christmas Day, a Chinese-origin computational model named Deepseek shook the landscape. It managed to compete against postdoctoral mathematics students at just 5% of the cost of OpenAI’s top-tier model (o1) while using only 1% of the GPU power for training. Additionally, this model demonstrated remarkable learning capabilities, is open-access, and allows operation on simple computers through a complex compression process. The sudden emergence of Deepseek prompted the hasty announcement of Project Stargate, with prominent figures like Masayoshi Son and Oracle’s Larry Ellison promising breakthroughs like curing cancer. Meanwhile, Elon Musk continues to clash with Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) on X. This story is far from over and promises to unfold with fascinating developments. Explore related questions

Title: DeepSeek's 'cheap' Chinese AI chatbot sparks tech stock selloff

US tech giant Nvidia lost over a sixth of its value after the surging popularity of a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) app spooked investors in the US and Europe. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot reportedly made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals, launched last week but has already become the most downloaded free app in the US. AI chip giant Nvidia and other tech firms connected to AI, including Microsoft and Google, saw their values tumble on Monday in the wake of DeepSeek's sudden rise. In a separate development, DeepSeek said on Monday it will temporarily limit registrations because of "large-scale malicious attacks" on its software. The DeepSeek chatbot was reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its rivals, raising questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. Last week, OpenAI joined a group of other firms who pledged to invest $500bn (£400bn) in building AI infrastructure in the US. President Donald Trump, in one of his first announcements since returning to office, called it "the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history" that would help keep "the future of technology" in the US. DeepSeek is powered by the open source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was trained for around $6m - significantly less than the billions spent by rivals. But this claim has been disputed by others in AI. The researchers say they use already existing technology, as well as open source code - software that can be used, modified or distributed by anybody free of charge. DeepSeek's emergence comes as the US is restricting the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China. To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology. This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before. It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry. After DeepSeek-R1 was launched earlier this month, the company boasted of "performance on par with" one of OpenAI's latest models when used for tasks such as maths, coding and natural language reasoning. Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Trump adviser Marc Andreessen described DeepSeek-R1 as "AI's Sputnik moment", a reference to the satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off-guard by their rival's technological achievement. DeepSeek's sudden popularity has startled stock markets in Europe and the US. In the US, AI chipmaker Nvidia ended Monday's trading having plunged 16.9% while its rival Broadcom slumped 17.4%. Other tech firms also sank, with Microsoft down 2.14% and Google's owner Alphabet down over 4%. In Europe, Dutch chip equipment maker ASML ended Monday's trading with its share price down by more than 7% while shares in Siemens Energy, which makes hardware related to AI, had plunged by a fifth. "This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn't necessarily been forefront, so it's taken the market a little bit by surprise," said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index. "So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that's going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they've already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure." Singapore-based technology equity adviser Vey-Sern Ling told the BBC it could "potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain". But Wall Street banking giant Citi cautioned that while DeepSeek could challenge the dominant positions of American companies such as OpenAI, issues faced by Chinese firms could hamper their development. "We estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US access to more advanced chips is an advantage," analysts said in a report. Meanwhile, DeepSeek said on Monday it had been the victim of a cyberattack. "Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service," it said in a statement. "Existing users can log in as usual. Thanks for your understanding and support." The company was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, a city in southeastern China. The 40-year-old, an information and electronic engineering graduate, also founded the hedge fund that backed DeepSeek. He reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, now banned from export to China. Experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to launch DeepSeek, by pairing these chips with cheaper, lower-end ones that are still available to import. Mr Liang was recently seen at a meeting between industry experts and the Chinese premier Li Qiang. In a July 2024 interview with The China Academy, Mr Liang said he was surprised by the reaction to the previous version of his AI model. "We didn't expect pricing to be such a sensitive issue," he said. "We were simply following our own pace, calculating costs, and setting prices accordingly."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Fundamental Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against other best fundamental stocks to buy now. The S&P 500 index closed 0.3% lower at 6,101.24 on Friday, January 24, reversing its course after hitting a fresh intraday record earlier in the session. The Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also slipped, with the former dropping 0.5% to 19,954.30 and the latter falling 140.82 points to 44,424.25. This marked the end of a four-day winning streak for the three major indexes. The decline was largely attributed to investors taking profits, particularly in mega-cap tech stocks. Despite this, the market remains bullish, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting their second consecutive positive week, rising 1.7% and 1.7% respectively. The Dow climbed 2.2% over the same period. In other news, President Trump made headlines on Thursday by calling for interest rates to drop immediately and asking Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations to lower the price of oil. Market participants are closely watching the President’s statements, which have had a significant impact on the market. However, the market’s optimism is largely driven by President Donald Trump’s pro-business policies, which have boosted risk assets. Investors are also relieved that the President has only made threats on the tariff front, rather than taking formal action, during his first few days in office.

In an interview with CNBC on January 23, Mike Bailey, Director of Research at FBB Capital Partners, discussed the current state of the market. He noted that companies have had a great quarter, which reflects the fact that the economy is doing well, people have jobs, and they’re buying things, which trickles down to the market. This, in turn, has a positive impact on the tech sector as a whole. However, Bailey advised investors to take a more nuanced approach and consider the specific fundamentals of each company. Bailey believes that large-cap companies have the greatest opportunity to meet or exceed investor expectations for growth. He noted that while small caps are trading cheaper, they may not be the best option for long-term investments or high-conviction plays. Bailey explained that his firm’s approach is focused on identifying companies with strong earnings growth potential, and larger cap companies tend to have more resources and a stronger track record of delivering on their growth promises. However, he did acknowledge that small caps can be a good option for investors who are looking to capitalize on a short-term economic cycle or recovery. Bailey emphasized the importance of looking beyond the top ten stocks that make up 50% of the market, which often dominate the conversation. He suggested that there are plenty of other companies that are worth considering. These companies, according to Bailey, offer a compelling combination of growth potential, valuation, and dividend yield, making them attractive options for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Furthermore, Bailey emphasized the importance of having a long-term perspective and not getting caught up in short-term market fluctuations. He encouraged investors to focus on the underlying fundamentals of each company and to avoid making emotional decisions based on market volatility. Large-cap companies with stable revenue and consistent net income growth remain attractive options for investors seeking reliable returns and long-term stability.

Title: DeepSeek: A shocking Chinese AI advancement is sending US stocks plunging
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/tech/deepseek-stocks-ai-china/index.html

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks dropped sharply Monday — and chipmaker Nvidia lost nearly $600 billion in market value — after a surprise advancement from a Chinese artificial intelligence company, DeepSeek, threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America’s technology industry. DeepSeek, a one-year-old startup, revealed a stunning capability last week: It presented a ChatGPT-like AI model called R1, which has all the familiar abilities, operating at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s, Google’s or Meta’s popular AI models. The company said it had spent just $5.6 million on computing power for its base model, compared with the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies. That sent shockwaves through markets, in particular the tech sector, on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged by 3.1% and the broader S&P 500 fell 1.5%. The Dow, boosted by health care and consumer companies that could be hurt by AI, was up 289 points, or about 0.7% higher. Stock market losses were far deeper at the beginning of the day. Meta last week said it would spend upward of $65 billion this year on AI development. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, last year said the AI industry would need trillions of dollars in investment to support the development of in-demand chips needed to power the electricity-hungry data centers that run the sector’s complex models. Marc Andreessen, a supporter of President Donald Trump and one of the world’s leading tech investors, called DeepSeek “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” in a post on X. The stunning achievement from a relatively unknown AI startup becomes even more shocking when considering that the United States for years has worked to restrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. That means DeepSeek was able to achieve its low-cost model on under-powered AI chips. US tech stocks got hammered Monday. Nvidia (NVDA), the leading supplier of AI chips, fell nearly 17% and lost $588.8 billion in market value — by far the most market value a stock has ever lost in a single day, more than doubling the previous record of $240 billion set by Meta nearly three years ago. For perspective, Nvidia lost more in market value Monday than all but 13 companies are worth — period. Nvidia began the day as the most valuable publicly traded stock on the market — over $3.4 trillion — after its shares more than doubled in each of the past two years. It ended the day in third place behind Apple and Microsoft. Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL), Google’s parent company, were also down sharply. Nvidia competitors Marvell, Broadcom, Micron and TSMC all fell sharply, too. Oracle (ORCL), Vertiv, Constellation, NuScale and other energy and data center companies tumbled. That dragged down the broader stock market, because tech stocks make up a significant chunk of the market — tech constitutes about 45% of the S&P 500, according to Keith Lerner, analyst at Truist. “The bottom line is the US outperformance has been driven by tech and the lead that US companies have in AI,” Lerner said. “The DeepSeek model rollout is leading investors to question the lead that US companies have and how much is being spent and whether that spending will lead to profits (or overspending).” This week kicks off a series of tech companies reporting earnings, so their response to the DeepSeek stunner could lead to tumultuous market movements in the days and weeks to come. In the meantime, investors are taking a closer look at Chinese AI companies. “Chinese tech companies, including new entrants like DeepSeek, are trading at significant discounts due to geopolitical concerns and weaker global demand,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo. “DeepSeek’s rise could spark renewed investor interest in undervalued Chinese AI companies, providing an alternative growth story.” The news also sparked a huge change in investments in non-technology companies on Wall Street. Energy companies had been traded up significantly higher in recent years because of the massive amounts of electricity needed to power AI data centers. But they all plummeted Monday. Constellation Energy (CEG), the company behind the planned revival of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant for powering AI, fell 21% Monday. Competitors like Vistra (VST) fell 28% and GE Vernova (GEV) was down 21%. Futures for natural gas, used to power electricity generators, tumbled 5.9%. Oil fell more than 2%. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also tumbled. One achievement, albeit a gobsmacking one, may not be enough to counter years of progress in American AI leadership. And a massive customer shift to a Chinese startup is unlikely. So the market selloff may be a bit overdone — or perhaps investors were looking for an excuse to sell. “Time will tell if the DeepSeek threat is real — the race is on as to what technology works and how the big Western players will respond and evolve,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital. “Markets had gotten too complacent on the beginning of the Trump 2.0 era and may have been looking for an excuse to pull back — and they got a great one here.” The industry is also taking the company at its word that the cost was so low. No one is really disputing it, but the market freak-out hinges on the truthfulness of a single and relatively unknown company. Although the cost-saving achievement may be significant, the R1 model is a ChatGPT competitor – a consumer-focused large-language model. It hasn’t yet proven it can handle some of the massively ambitious AI capabilities for industries that – for now – still require tremendous infrastructure investments. “Thanks to its rich talent and capital base, the US remains the most promising ‘home turf’ from which we expect to see the emergence of the first self-improving AI,” said Giuseppe Sette, president of AI market research firm Reflexivity.

Title: Pro-Crypto Policies Surge As Banks Lag—Here’s How They Can Catch Up

Go ahead and continuously improvement concept, silhouette man jump on a cliff from past to future ... [+] with cloud sky background. The landscape of digital assets is undergoing a significant shift as pro crypto regulatory clarity begins to take shape. Policymakers are moving faster than the price of Bitcoin. In recent weeks, significant developments, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) withdrawal of the contentious Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) via SAB 122 and President Trump’s January 23, 2025 Digital Assets Executive Order, signal a bullish trajectory for crypto policies. Meanwhile, traditional banks, burdened by outdated frameworks and resistance to the emerging digital asset industry, risk establishing their foothold in this rapidly evolving sector. SAB 121, introduced during former SEC Chair Gary Gensler's tenure, required financial institutions to account for customer-held crypto assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. While purportedly intended to protect investors from insolvency risks, critics lambasted the guidance as overly punitive and impractical for innovation. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce quickly celebrated the SEC’s decision to revoke SAB 121in an X/Twitter post, and bid SAB 121 “a not-so-fond farewell”. SAB 122 directs firms to follow FASB and international accounting standards, which better suit the evolving crypto landscape. Peirce highlighted that this change removes a regulatory barrier, fostering innovation and collaboration between crypto firms and financial institutions. This rollback reduces operational burdens and encourages institutional participation, paving the way for broader crypto adoption. On the heels of the SEC announcement came President Trump's much-anticipated Digital Assets Executive Order. This policy framework overhaul addresses longstanding issues, including the legal categorization of digital assets, taxation, and cross-border applications​. The EO outlines key pillars aimed at fostering innovation while ensuring consumer protection: These measures signal the administration’s recognition of blockchain technology's potential to revolutionize finance and other industries. In stark contrast to the policy momentum, traditional banks remain ensnared in skepticism and operational inertia, much of which can be attributed to prudential regulators’ admonitions. Documents obtained by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request initiated by Coinbase revealed that U.S. regulators informally discouraged banks from expanding crypto services, despite officially denying a policy of "debanking"​​, also referred to within the crypto industry as Chokepoint 2.0. While crypto adoption surged globally, most banks have failed to innovate their offerings. Their hesitancy contrasts starkly with the likes of Fidelity and Morgan Stanley, which are actively expanding crypto-based investment products​​. As regulatory clarity improves, banks must pivot quickly to avoid irrelevance. Opportunities include: Collaborating with fintech and blockchain startups: Banks can integrate blockchain to enhance cross-border payments and real-time settlement systems. Investing in crypto infrastructure: Developing secure custodial services and compliance solutions will attract institutional clients exploring crypto markets. Educating stakeholders: From brokers to customers, knowledge-building is critical to bridge the gap between traditional finance and emerging technologies​​. Failure to adapt will likely result in a widening gap between innovators and incumbents, where fintech players dominate while banks struggle to maintain relevance. The SEC's revised stance and the administration's pro-crypto policies underscore the urgency for financial institutions to adapt. While regulators open the door for innovation, banks are at a crossroads: evolve or be left behind. As the digital asset revolution accelerates, the institutions that embrace this paradigm shift will shape the future of finance, while those clinging to legacy models risk extinction. While many banks have hesitated to embrace the digital assets revolution, others have positioned themselves as trailblazers, leveraging crypto innovations to secure a foothold in the industry. However, the stark contrast between public rhetoric and private actions among certain institutions reveals a hypocrisy that cannot be ignored. Some financial institutions have embraced the crypto wave, proactively adapting their models to stay ahead of the curve. Fidelity Investments stands out as a pioneer in institutional crypto adoption. Since launching Fidelity Digital Assets in 2018, the company has offered secure custodial services and direct access to bitcoin for institutional investors. Fidelity was also among the first to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Canada and played a key role in the U.S. debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, when nine new spot Bitcoin ETFs and two conversions hit the market, collectively drawing $1.9 billion in inflows during their first three days of trading, according to Reuters. Similarly, Goldman Sachs, once a crypto skeptic, has now emerged as a player in legitimizing digital assets within traditional finance. The bank operates a robust digital asset desk, offering clients access to cash-settled derivatives, options, and futures tied to Bitcoin. According to Mathew McDermott, Goldman’s Global Head of Digital Assets, the firm has developed a comprehensive suite of crypto products to meet growing institutional demand. In the second quarter of 2024, Goldman made its debut in the spot Bitcoin ETF market, purchasing $418 million worth of bitcoin funds, including a $238 million stake in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust. The bank also disclosed positions in ETFs from Grayscale, Fidelity, and Invesco, as detailed in CNBC’s coverage of its Q2 filings. In stark contrast, Bank of America (BoA) has been a notorious laggard. While quietly filing for blockchain-related patents for years, the bank has publicly downplayed the potential of cryptocurrencies. BoA’s leadership has repeatedly warned clients of crypto's volatility, characterizing it as a “speculative bubble.” Despite these claims, the bank's internal research division acknowledged in a 2021 report that blockchain technology could fundamentally reshape finance. BoA’s inconsistency underscores its struggle to reconcile crypto's potential with its conservative stance​​. In a recent Squawk Box interview during Davos 2025, BoA CEO Brian Moynihan hedged his bets regarding institutional adoption of crypto, acknowledging BofA and other banking incumbents may have to adopt crypto payments given the regulatory shift. Wells Fargo has similarly been slow to act. Although offering limited crypto-related investment products to wealthy clients in 2021, years behind competitors, the bank has focused primarily on cautionary narratives about crypto fraud and environmental concerns rather than embracing innovation. The bank’s approach began to pivot in 2024, permitting bitcoin ETF investments for clients who specifically requested access. Additionally, according to DeCrypt.co, paperwork filed with the SEC shows that the bank had purchased shares of Grayscale's GBTC spot Bitcoin ETF, and that it also has exposure to Bitcoin Depot Inc., a Bitcoin ATM provider. Perhaps the most striking example of hypocrisy lies with JPMorgan Chase. For years, CEO Jamie Dimon has been one of bitcoin’s most vocal critics, famously calling it a “fraud” in 2017 and warning that it would “blow up.” Publicly, Dimon continues to maintain a stance of disdain for cryptocurrencies, repeatedly labeling them as speculative assets with no inherent value. However, JPMorgan has been integrating blockchain and digital asset into its operations for years. The bank developed JPM Coin (now rebranded Kinexys Digital Payments), a digital token designed to facilitate instant cross-border payments for institutional clients, showcasing its faith in blockchain technology for real-world applications. Moreover, JPMorgan has become a key player in the Bitcoin ETF space, serving as an authorized participant for the Blackrock bitcoin ETF (IBIT). JPMorgan's dual approach—public skepticism paired with internal adoption—highlights a troubling trend among some legacy institutions. These banks publicly criticize cryptocurrencies, discouraging retail clients from participating with brash headlines, while leveraging the same technology to bolster their institutional offerings and operational efficiencies. This pattern of public disdain and private opportunism is more than a marketing inconsistency; it undermines trust. As retail investors increasingly notice this duplicity, they may shift loyalty to forward-thinking incumbents, fintech startups, crypto-native institutions that offer transparency and alignment with the industry's ethos. Banks that remain insincere about their crypto involvement risk alienating a growing segment of clients who view blockchain technology as the future of finance. Transparency and trust are paramount in the new digital asset economy. As digital assets evolve, banking professionals face a clear choice: adapt or risk irrelevance. While some institutions have embraced blockchain technology, many still lag in understanding and integrating crypto into their services. Here’s how banking professionals can stay competitive: Crypto and blockchain are no longer fringe concepts. Banking professionals must understand blockchain’s foundational concepts, including cryptocurrencies, DeFi (decentralized finance), and NFTs. Staying informed about regulatory updates from the SEC, CFTC, IRS and prudential regulators is also critical. Internal continuing education and client education is key. Blockchain’s value extends far beyond cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key applications include: To meet evolving client needs, banks must innovate. Priority areas include: Rather than reinventing the wheel, banks should collaborate with fintech startups and blockchain companies to accelerate adoption. Partnerships can fast-track blockchain implementation in clearing, settlements, and lending. With increasing regulatory clarity, compliance can be a competitive advantage. By proactively addressing anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), and taxation requirements, banks can position themselves as trusted leaders in the crypto space. Internal inertia is often a bank’s biggest obstacle. Leadership must prioritize innovation by recruiting blockchain experts, upskilling staff, and piloting crypto-related projects. The digital assets landscape in the United States and beyond is evolving rapidly, creating both opportunities and challenges for financial professionals. With regulatory clarity improving, including the Digital Assets Executive Order and the withdrawal of SAB 121, the path is clear for broader institutional adoption. Traditional banks can no longer justify a head-in-sand approach and now face an urgent and unavoidable crossroads: embrace innovation to lead in this new financial era or cling to outdated models and risk obsolescence. Financial professionals must act now to build the expertise, infrastructure, and partnerships needed to thrive. Those who hesitate may find themselves sidelined in this new digital asset economy.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. The new regulatory environment has the technology sector eyeing prominent growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Big Tech is set to release earnings next week and investors are excited to see how the group performed in the last quarter. On January 24, Dan Ives, managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, appeared in an interview on Morning Brief at Yahoo Finance to share his 2025 outlook for the tech sector. Ives suggested that the Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech and advises investors to “grab popcorn” for the earnings week ahead. He also shared his optimism towards the billion-dollar investments made by the group before 2025 and claimed that the “fourth industrial revolution” has just begun. He also suggested that AI spending by companies heavily depends on the use cases for the company, and emphasized the unique selling point for each of the names in mega-cap tech names. Ives stated that the ability to monetize stall bases has been the crucial factor driving the growth among tech names, which happens to mimic what the hyperscalers have done. Ives emphasized that investments in artificial intelligence are now going to play out on the consumer side and remained confident that Big Tech is a step ahead in terms of the AI journey to monetization. He believes that seeing the return on investment play out, the Street is underestimating the growth in the tech sector, not just for the earnings next week but for 2025 as a whole. He also suggested that the regulatory environment is drastically changing especially in favor of the autonomous vehicles market and expects a massive year ahead for the segment and stocks associated with self-driving technologies and autonomous vehicle driving. The year ahead looks super solid for companies in the growth sector, namely artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, biotechnology, fintech, and software. While most of it is because of the efforts made by these names over the past year, the promising regulatory environment is going to boost the position of these stocks significantly. We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 23, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor and IT company that produces accelerators capable of managing complex AI workloads. Over the past few months, AMD launched advanced processors for the next generation of PCs and high-performing computing solutions for the AI computing demand. For instance, on January 6, AMD announced the launch of its first commercial Dell PCs that run on its AI processors. The new processors offer improved efficiency, privacy, personalization, and connectivity coupled with cutting-edge AI compute and advanced business productivity tools. On January 22, Thomas O’Malley, an analyst at Barclays shared his stance on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The analyst highlighted that the stock has been struggling for the past year. However, O’Malley believes that AMD’s investments in AI will allow the company to achieve year-over-year growth of a few billion dollars for MI series accelerators in 2025. He also added that the company will have to wait a little longer to garner opportunities for additional market share. Despite that, the analyst gives an overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $140, adding that the stock may potentially gain 12% in the coming months. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) attributes its growth to its data center products and ever-growing demand for its Ryzen PC processors. The company is emerging in the AI and technology sector as a leader in the production of accelerators and processors. Overall, AMD ranks 4th on our list of most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Trump’s RTO edict raises concerns over morale, efficiency — and burnout
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3808863/trumps-rto-edict-raises-concerns-over-morale-efficiency-and-burnout.html

President Donald J. Trump’s executive order to federal employees to return to the office “as soon as practicable” will have a variety of repercussions — most of them negative, according to industry analysts and others. The return-to-office (RTO) policy issued last week signals Trump’s intent to fulfill campaign promises to reform the 2.3-million-strong federal workforce, which he has criticized as inefficient and bloated. The language in Trump’s order doesn’t clarify whether it applies only to the estimated 10% of federal civilian workers — about 228,000 as of May 2024 — who work remotely full-time, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Trump may be upping the stakes, but then-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signed legislation Jan. 5 designed to bring more federal employees back to the office and increase the efficiency of office space utilization. Both men were likely taking cues from various businesses that have instituted RTO mandates in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2022, Tesla and SpaceX chief executive CEO Elon Musk — now a close advisor to Trump — delivered an RTO ultimatum to his two companies’ white-collar workers: get back in the corporate office or face firing. Musk’s letter to executive staff at the time specified: “The office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo-office. If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.” Other corporations have followed suit more recently. In December, Amazon and AT&T ended their work-from-home policies. AT&T went so far as to tell 9,000 of its 149,000 workers to relocate to an office area or be fired. Peter Miscovich, managing director at global real estate firm JLL, said the US is entering a “hybrid winter,” as many CEOs impose RTO mandates that could pose talent attraction and retention challenges for leading IT organizations. That’s especially true for advanced tech leadership teams and IT departments that have built sophisticated hybrid work practices over time and invested significantly in hybrid operational technologies and related infrastructure across global organizations, he said. “Perhaps the most significant risk associated with RTO mandates is the potential loss of valuable and critical IT digital talent,” Miscovich said. “The IT tech sector has embraced hybrid work more thoroughly than most industries, and IT professionals now view hybrid workplace flexibility as a standard expectation for the workforce rather than a perk.” Over the past two or so years, remote work — once praised as the new paradigm for productivity and employee satisfaction — began losing some of its luster as more organizations required workers to get back to their cubicles, at least part time. In fact, many organizations are already struggling to fill a significant IT talent gap. In some cases, generative artificial intelligence (genAI) has been able to replace needed workers; in most other instances, the dearth of tech talent remains. According to new research from the University of Pittsburgh, S&P 500 companies that rolled out RTO mandates experienced “abnormally high” employee turnover and longer time-to-hire when filling job vacancies. “This significant IT digital talent brain-drain risk is particularly acute given the current competitive market for technology talent,” Miscovich said. In 2025, CIOs and senior IT leaders face growing challenges when trying to attract top talent while maintaining operational excellence and managing workplace transformation amid RTO mandates, according to Miscovich. Resistance to the mandates is especially strong in global IT departments where hybrid and remote work are deeply integrated and have proven highly effective. John Veitch, dean of the School of Business and Management at Notre Dame de Namur in Belmont, California, said RTO mandates are “generally” a sign of insecure leadership. In other words, executives don’t trust what they can’t see. RTO mandates say, “I have to see people working and earning their living,” he said. Veitch didn’t have strong feelings either way about RTOs involving the federal government workers, though from a workflow point of view, he said he’s not convinced there are benefits. He agreed that with the tech marketplace unemployment rate near historic lows, it could push some workers out the door, he said. “I don’t think the federal government pays particularly well relative to what you can get if you’re a top-flight technologist at a Silicon Valley firm,” Veitch said. “Obviously, people who have options will choose those options, particularly if return-to-office is a deal breaker for them. So, I don’t think it’s going to help the government in any way, shape or form to retain talented people.” Further research points to other problems with RTO mandates. Being in the office five days a week leads to higher rates of burnout, lower morale, and inefficiencies associated with commuting time, according to J. P. Gownder, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. On average, US workers spend 2.3 days in the office each week, according to a Stanford University study. A separate Stanford study found that hybrid work had zero effect on workers’ productivity or career advancement and dramatically boosted retention rates. In general, hybrid working arrangements hold numerous advantages over full-time, in-office, Gownder said, and for non-collaborative work, home offices are far better suited because they create “a focused environment.” “Despite some managers’ concerns, employees who work in hybrid fashion are more productive than those who spend all their time in the office. Most employees engage in a mix of personal and collaborative work,” he said. In fact, hybrid work boosts employee productivity, performance, and retention, according to Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford. Because of RTO mandates, employees are often forced to commute in only to do tasks they could handle at home. Even in the office, many still rely on videoconferencing to collaborate with colleagues in other locations. As a result of that and other inconveniences, organizations that move from hybrid work to full-time in-office work can expect higher attrition rates, Gownder argued. “Sometimes, managers impose these policies specifically to drive higher attrition, in lieu of layoffs,” he said. “IT talent often can work effectively remotely, and attrition rates in general are higher among IT professionals.” Additionally, the federal government and private companies have a dramatically smaller number of offices to which they could return as many companies have consolidated their footprints to a few key hubs. AT&T, for example, ordered 60,000 managers to work from one of only nine offices, forcing 9,000 employees to relocate or resign. As the pandemic eased in 2022 and 2023, US core business centers in large and small cities continued to suffer the after-effects of remote- and hybrid-work policies, which led to a 20% to 40% reduction in office space use and a devaluation of properties. The big switch to remote work left many downtowns largely empty for months. Data indicates that approximately 80% of offices had downsized by the end of 2023. Other sources indicate the downsizing slowed last year and by Q4 2024 office leasing rates were at about 92% of pre-pandemic levels, according to David Brodeur-Johnson, employee experience research lead at Forrester Research. “And yes, I believe that firms would be willing to expand their office spaces as needed to keep up with capacity, but most aren’t there yet,” he said. While most organizations adopted a hybrid-work policies, requiring employees to be in the office a few days each week while allowing work from home on other days, the Trump Administration’s policies are a strict, five-day RTO. That’s likely to incur an employee backlash, Brodeur-Johnson said. The federal government, he said, risks employee disengagement more than attrition. Monitoring federal employee surveys like FedRamp will be crucial, as disengagement is costly for both employees and employers. “It’s important to bear in mind also that autonomy is a primary source of intrinsic motivation — the kind that comes from within — so I would argue strongly that the biggest negative impact will likely be to employee engagement instead of attrition,” Brodeur-Johnson said. Academic studies also show that strong social relationships are key to remote work success, with emotional closeness outweighing physical distance. But simply being in the office doesn’t promote social relationships, Brodeur-Johnson pointed out. “Which is why companies like Nvidia have left it up to employees to decide, up to and including fully remote work,” he said. “How close people feel to each other emotionally is far more important than physical distance.” While Trump’s executive order could spark a wider look at RTO edicts elsewhere, most private companies have settled on what their employees will tolerate. Meanwhile, federal agencies have steadily increased in-office requirements, so the latest change shouldn’t be a surprise, Brodeur-Johnson said. But for some workers — especially those with care-giving duties or better flexible job options — it could be the tipping point. Top talent might leave first, which is why RTO mandates have slowed recently, he said. Senior Reporter Lucas Mearian covers AI in the enterprise, Future of Work issues, healthcare IT and FinTech.

Beijing, China. Photo: Getty DeepSeek, an AI startup just over a year old, stirred awe and consternation in Silicon Valley with its breakthrough artificial intelligence model that offered comparable performance to the world's best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of the cost. Created in China's Hangzhou, DeepSeek carries far-reaching implications for the global tech industry and supply chain, offering a counterpoint to the widespread belief that the future of AI will require ever-increasing amounts of power and energy to develop. What exactly is DeepSeek? DeepSeek is a Chinese startup founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops open-source AI models, and its eponymous mobile app surged to the top of the iPhone's download charts in the US after its release in early January. The DeepSeek app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its R1 release offers performance on par with OpenAI's latest and has granted license for individuals interested in developing chatbots on the technology to build on it. How does DeepSeek R1 compare to OpenAI or Meta AI? Though not fully detailed by the company, the cost of training and developing DeepSeek's models appears to be only a fraction of what's required for OpenAI or Meta Platforms Inc.'s best products. The much better efficiency of the model puts into question the need for vast expenditures of capital to acquire the latest and most powerful AI accelerators from the likes of Nvidia Corp. That also amplifies attention on US export curbs of such advanced semiconductors to China â€ which were intended to prevent a breakthrough of the sort that DeepSeek seems to represent. DeepSeek R1 is near or better than rival models in several leading benchmarks such as AIME 2024 for mathematical tasks, MMLU for general knowledge and AlpacaEval 2.0 for question-and-answer performance. It also ranks among the top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated leaderboard called Chatbot Arena. What's raising alarm in the US? Washington has banned the export of high-end technologies like GPU semiconductors to China, in a bid to stall the country's advances in AI, the pivotal frontier in the US-China contest for tech supremacy. But DeepSeek's progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have worked their way around the restrictions, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. While it remains unclear how much advanced AI-training hardware DeepSeek has had access to, the company's demonstrated enough to suggest the trade restrictions have not been entirely effective in stymying China's progress. When did DeepSeek spark global interest? The AI developer has been closely watched since the release of its earliest model in 2023. Then in November, it gave the world a glimpse of its DeepSeek R1 reasoning model, designed to mimic human thinking. That model underpins its mobile chatbot app, which together with the web interface in January rocketed to global renown as a much cheaper OpenAI alternative, with investor Marc Andreessen calling it "AI's Sputnik moment." The DeepSeek mobile app was downloaded 1.6 million times by Jan. 25 and ranked No. 1 in iPhone app stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the US and the UK, according to data from market tracker App Figures. Who is DeepSeek's founder? Born in Guangdong in 1985, Liang received bachelor's and masters' degrees in electronic and information engineering from Zhejiang University. He founded DeepSeek with only 10 million yuan ($1.4m) in registered capital, according to company database Tianyancha. The bottleneck for further advances is not more fundraising, Liang said in an interview with Chinese outlet 36kr, but US restrictions on access to the best chips. Most of his top researchers were fresh graduates from top Chinese universities, he said, stressing the need for China to develop its own domestic ecosystem akin to the one built around Nvidia and its AI chips. "More investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation. Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation," Liang said. Where does DeepSeek stand in China's AI landscape? China's technology leaders, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. to Tencent Holdings Ltd., have poured significant money and resources into the race to acquire hardware and customers for their AI ventures. Alongside Kai-Fu Lee's 01.AI startup, DeepSeek stands out with its open-source approach designed to recruit the largest number of users quickly before developing monetization strategies atop that large audience. Because DeepSeek's models are more affordable, it's already played a role in helping drive down costs for AI developers in China, where the bigger players have engaged in a price war that's seen successive waves of price cuts over the past year and a half. What are the implications for the global AI marketplace? DeepSeek's success may push OpenAI and other US providers to lower their pricing to maintain their established lead. It also calls into question the vast spending by companies like Meta and Microsoft Corp each of which has committed to capex of $65 billion or more this year, largely on AI infrastructure â€ if more efficient models can compete with a much smaller outlay. That roiled Asia stock markets as investors sought Chinese names linked to DeepSeek, such as Iflytek Co., and moved away from chipmaking supply chain names like Advantest Corp. that may be exposed to any shortfall in expected demand for AI semiconductors. Already, developers around the world are experimenting with DeepSeek's software and looking to build tools with it. That could quicken the adoption of advanced AI reasoning models while also potentially touching off additional concern about the need for guardrails around their use. DeepSeek's advances may hasten regulation to control how AI is developed. What are DeepSeek's shortcomings? Like all other Chinese AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed sensitive in China. It deflects queries about Tiananmen Square or geopolitically fraught questions like the possibility of China invading Taiwan. In tests, the DeepSeek bot is capable of giving detailed responses about political figures like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but declines to do so about Chinese President Xi Jinping. DeepSeek's cloud infrastructure is likely to be tested by its sudden popularity. The company briefly experienced a major outage on Jan. 27 and will have to manage even more traffic as new and returning users pour more queries into its chatbot.

Title: NVIDIA Sheds $384 Billion In Value Within Hours As China’s DeepSeek Shocks Western Markets

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Chip designer NVIDIA Corporation's shares shed more than $300 billion in value in premarket trading today as investors speculated about the implications of Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek being able to train models on par with their American counterparts at a lower budget. DeepSeek's R1 model made a splash earlier this month to quickly become the most downloaded application on Apple's AppStore over the weekend. NVIDIA's shares were down by 11% in premarket trading as they joined peers from Japan and European chip equipment manufacturer ASML to report low single-digit percentage share price losses. Today's stock market selloff, which started soon after trading opened in Japan, affected data center stocks in the Asian country, the shares of chip manufacturing equipment provider ASML and NVIDIA. It was also reflected in the NASDAQ's futures and the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. ASML, which is highly exposed to the global semiconductor industry due to its status as the sole provider of advanced EUV chip manufacturing machines, saw its shares tumble by a whopping 11% in Europe ahead of its crucial earnings report due later this which will set the pace for 2025 AI expectations. The stock had already bled 22% in October last year when the firm guided weak equipment demand for 2025 and caused investors to price out some of their AI-related demand expectations. ASML's ADRs that trade on the NASDAQ exchange are down by 11% in premarket trading to remove roughly $30 billion from its valuation. Over the past six months, the ADRs are down by 16% excluding today's premarket losses. Japanese investment conglomerate Softbank, which sought to create headlines earlier this month through President Trump's $500 billion AI initiative, was down by 8.32% in Japanese markets. Chip testing equipment manufacturer Advantest also slid by 8.6%. Yet, due to its massive market valuation that made it the most valuable company in the world last week, NVIDIA's market cap has taken the hardest hit from the DeepSeek fallout. Its shares have lost roughly 11% in premarket trading to wipe out a stunning ~$384 billion in value from where it last stood as trading closed last week. NVIDIA's shares traded in Germany are down by an even larger 11.7%. After NVIDIA, one of the worst-hit chip stocks is semiconductor designer Broadcom. Its shares had soared by an unbelievable 38% in December when management shared that the firm expects to earn tens of billions of dollars through AI chip sales in 2027. However, as investors ponder whether the demand for AI chips will actually materialize given the currently held beliefs surrounding DeepSeek's training resources, they are fleeing Broadcom's stock in droves. Its shares are down by 10.5% in premarket trading to remove roughly $100 billion from its Friday valuation. NVIDIA's smaller rival, AMD, is also down by 5.3% in the premarket. While AMD's products, namely its accelerators, are also suitable for AI workloads, NVIDIA's GPUs are the industry leaders and see the highest demand. British chip design house Arm Ltd, whose CEO Rene Haas insisted multiple times earlier this month that his firm's CPUs are alongside all AI GPUs, has shed 9.43%. Other losers include Microsoft Corporation and Facebook's parent company, Meta. Their shares are down by 6% and 4.6% with investors pondering about the wisdom behind their multi-billion dollar capital expenditures. Shares of consumer technology giant Apple, which is only expected to benefit from consumer AI, are unfazed and have lost a mere 0.9% in premarket trading.

Manage your account (Bloomberg) -- DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial-intelligence startup that’s just over a year old, has stirred awe and consternation in Silicon Valley after demonstrating AI models that offer comparable performance to the world’s best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of their development cost. Most Read from Bloomberg Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Budapest Mayor Aims to Block Orban’s Plans to Build ‘Mini Dubai’ Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials Vienna Embraces Heat Pumps to Ditch Russian Gas Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires DeepSeek’s emergence may offer a counterpoint to the widespread belief that the future of AI will require ever-increasing amounts of computing power and energy. Global technology stocks tumbled on Jan. 27 as hype around DeepSeek’s innovation snowballed and investors began to digest the implications for its US-based rivals and AI hardware suppliers such as Nvidia Corp. What exactly is DeepSeek? DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops AI models that are open-source, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of the iPhone download charts in the US after its release in early January. The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its R1 release offers performance on par with the latest iteration of ChatGPT. It is offering licenses for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it, at a price well below what OpenAI charges for similar access. Follow The Big Take daily podcast wherever you listen. How does DeepSeek R1 compare to OpenAI or Meta AI? DeepSeek says R1’s performance approaches or improves on that of rival models in several leading benchmarks such as AIME 2024 for mathematical tasks, MMLU for general knowledge and AlpacaEval 2.0 for question-and-answer performance. It also ranks among the top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated leaderboard called Chatbot Arena. Though not fully detailed by the company, the cost of training and developing DeepSeek’s models appears to be only a fraction of what’s required for OpenAI or Meta Platforms Inc.’s best products. The greater efficiency of the model puts into question the need for vast expenditures of capital to acquire the latest and most powerful AI accelerators from the likes of Nvidia. It also focuses attention on US export curbs of such advanced semiconductors to China — which were intended to prevent a breakthrough of the sort that DeepSeek appears to represent. When did DeepSeek spark global interest? The AI developer has been closely watched since the release of its earliest model in 2023. Then in November, it gave the world a glimpse of its DeepSeek R1 reasoning model, designed to mimic human thinking. That model underpins its chatbot app, which exploded in popularity as a much cheaper OpenAI alternative, with investor Marc Andreessen calling it “AI’s Sputnik moment.” The DeepSeek mobile app was downloaded 1.6 million times by Jan. 25 and ranked No. 1 in iPhone app stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the US and the UK, according to data from market tracker App Figures. What did we learn from the giant stock market reaction? For much of the past two-plus years since ChatGPT kicked off the global AI frenzy, investors have bet that improvements in AI will require ever more advanced chips from the likes of Nvidia. The DeepSeek breakthrough suggests AI models are emerging that can achieve a comparable performance using less sophisticated chips for a smaller outlay. Investors offloaded Nvidia stock in response, sending the shares down 17% on Jan. 27 and erasing $589 billion of value from the world’s largest company — a stock market record. Semiconductor machine maker ASML Holding NV and other companies that also benefited from booming demand for cutting-edge AI hardware also tumbled. DeepSeek’s success calls into question the vast spending by companies like Meta and Microsoft Corp. — each of which has committed to capex of $65 billion or more this year, largely on AI infrastructure. Shares in Meta and Microsoft also opened lower, though by smaller margins than Nvidia, with investors weighing the potential for substantial savings on the tech giants’ AI investments. Meta even recovered later in the session to close higher. Chinese names linked to DeepSeek, such as Iflytek Co., also climbed. Some industry watchers suggested the industry overall could benefit from DeepSeek’s breakthrough if it pushes OpenAI and other US providers to cut their prices, spurring faster adoption of AI. How could DeepSeek affect the global strategic competition over AI? AI is the key frontier in the US-China contest for tech supremacy. Washington has banned the export to China of equipment such as high-end graphics processing units in a bid to stall the country’s advances. DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have worked their way around those restrictions, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. Still, it remains unclear how much advanced AI-training hardware DeepSeek has had access to. Already, developers around the world are experimenting with DeepSeek’s software and looking to build tools with it. This could help US companies improve the efficiency of their AI models and quicken the adoption of advanced AI reasoning. That in turn may force regulators to lay down rules on how these models are used, and to what end. DeepSeek’s progress raises a further question, one that often arises when a Chinese company makes strides into foreign markets: Could the troves of data the mobile app collects and stores in Chinese servers present a privacy or security threats to US citizens? The fact that DeepSeek’s models are open-source opens the possibility that users in the US could take the code and run the models in a way that wouldn’t touch servers in China. Who is DeepSeek’s founder? Born in Guangdong in 1985, engineering graduate Liang has never studied or worked outside of mainland China. He received bachelor’s and masters’ degrees in electronic and information engineering from Zhejiang University. He founded DeepSeek with 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in registered capital, according to company database Tianyancha. The bottleneck for further advances is not more fundraising, Liang said in an interview with Chinese outlet 36kr, but US restrictions on access to the best chips. Most of his top researchers were fresh graduates from top Chinese universities, he said, stressing the need for China to develop its own domestic ecosystem akin to the one built around Nvidia and its AI chips. “More investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation. Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation,” Liang said. Liang has been compared to OpenAI founder Sam Altman, but the Chinese citizen keeps a much lower profile and seldom speaks publicly. Where does DeepSeek stand in China’s AI landscape? China’s technology leaders, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. to Tencent Holdings Ltd., have poured significant money and resources into the race to acquire hardware and customers for their AI ventures. Alongside Kai-Fu Lee’s 01.AI startup, DeepSeek stands out with its open-source approach — designed to recruit the largest number of users quickly before developing monetization strategies atop that large audience. Because DeepSeek’s models are more affordable, it’s already played a role in helping drive down costs for AI developers in China, where the bigger players have engaged in a price war that’s seen successive waves of price cuts over the past year and a half. What are DeepSeek’s shortcomings? Like all other Chinese AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed sensitive in China. It deflects queries about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or geopolitically fraught questions such as the possibility of China invading Taiwan.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany will hold a snap national election on Feb. 23 following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-way coalition. Germany has two centrist, "big-tent" parties: Scholz's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the opposition conservatives, an alliance of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). However, they have both lost support in recent years, with smaller parties such as the environmentalist Greens and far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) gaining ground.

Big Tech's rapid earnings growth finally slowing has been a risk to the market strategists have been talking about for more than a year. Monday’s DeepSeek-driven selloff could be an opportunity to pick up beaten-down AI stocks, according to some Wall Street analysts. The stock market has performed exceptionally well in the past couple of years, with the S&P 500 producing a total return of nearly 50% between 2023 and 2024. In fact, the S&P 500 reached a fresh all-time high on the day this article was written. Real estate has been one of the worst performing parts of the stock market over the past few years -- not necessarily because the businesses in this sector aren't doing well, but because REITs are some of the most interest rate-sensitive stocks in the market. There is a little bit of a catch, however. NEW YORK/LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Global investors dumped tech stocks on Monday as they worried that the emergence of a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model would threaten the dominance of AI leaders like Nvidia, evaporating $593 billion of the chipmaker's market value, a record one-day loss for any company on Wall Street. This led the tech-heavy Nasdaq to fall 3.1% on Monday. Nvidia was the Nasdaq's biggest drag, with its shares tumbling just under 17% and marking a record one-day loss in market capitalization for a Wall Street stock, according to LSEG data. The roughly $78 billion the Oracle of Omaha has spent buying this stock since mid-2018 decisively signals it's his favorite. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) roared higher last year, gaining more than 170%, and emerged as the key player in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang even called the company the "on-ramp" to AI during an interview a few months ago on the BG2Pod podcast. Nvidia is well positioned to benefit over the long term and in the near term. And removes a feature. Intel is expected to report fourth-quarter results after the market closes Thursday, with analysts expecting the chipmaker to swing to a loss.

Looking back, 2024 was a spectacular year for the crypto world, marking a transformative milestone in technology, markets, and ecosystems. It will be remembered as a landmark chapter in the crypto history, with surging institutional interest in crypto assets, technology innovations, regulatory advancements and Bitcoin (BTC) reaching new heights fuelled by the crypto friendly Trump administration. We just entered the new year 2025. For me it is a tradition to deliver a blog in which I present the main trends for the new year on blockchain and crypto. This blog that will be somewhat longer than normal, dives into the core trends that will further shape the crypto market in 2025 and beyond. thereby increasingly transforming traditional finance. I Existing blockchain services will gain more massive adoption A first trend we will see is that in 2025 existing blockchain services will gain more massive adoption. Most important are tokenised real world Assets (RWA), DeFi, crypto ETFs as well as the introduction of more stablecoins. Tokenised RWAs reshaping finance One of the most significant trends in 2024 reshaping finance is the tokenisation of real-world assets, like property, commodities, real estate and securities, attracting both investors and companies from of a range of industries. This is transforming traditional finance, enhancing liquidity, transparency, and accessibility in the financial markets to various assets classes. By converting real world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, tokenisation is unlocking new investment opportunities and making traditionally illiquid assets, such as real estate, more accessible.to a wider range of investors. Tokenization enables fractional ownership, making them tradable even in small fractions, allowing investors to buy and sell portions of assets, thereby unlocking liquidity for traditionally nonliquid assets The trend of tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) is expected to take off in an accelerated way in 2025 hitting critical mass, revolutionizing how traditional finance interacts with blockchain technology. 2025 will push the boundaries of what can be tokenized. From medical data to personal biometrics, tokenizing assets once deemed untouchable will unlock new markets and create unprecedented opportunities for digital value. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): reaching all-time highs Decentralized finance (DeFi) that refers to financial services built on blockchain networks that operate without traditional intermediaries like banks, has exploded over the past few years. They provide decentralized alternatives to banking, lending, and trading. But this is just the beginning. DeFi is projected to expand significantly in 2025 and beyond, remaining a dominant force in the crypto space. Tokenized securities and high-value assets will thereby catalyse DeFi’s growth, attracting both retail and institutional investors, adding new liquidity and utility. The DeFi sector could benefit from further integration with traditional financial systems, allowing for seamless transactions between fiat and cryptocurrencies. As the DeFi ecosystem matures, and DeFi platforms such as automated market makers (AMM's) and decentralised exchanges (DEX's) become more mature and more user-friendly, it is likely that a growing number of investors will turn to these services for flexible lending and borrowing solutions. This year the DeFi market could reach a $100 billion valuation as more platforms solidify their roles within the ecosystem, more than double compared to 2024.. Increased Market Share of Crypto ETFs Crypto ETFs have seen significant developments, particularly with the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by the SEC in January 2024. This marked a transformative moment for the cryptocurrency market, paving the way for traditional financial players to include these products in their portfolios without the need for navigating crypto exchanges and wallets. This approval already provided a massive inflow of institutional capital, with Bitcoin’s price seeing a notable boost above $100.000, following the announcement of Trump’s presidential victory. The emergence and growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could continue through 2025, significantly accelerating institutional adoption. Bitcoin ETFs would get more inflows than ever before and maybe reach $40–50 billion this year. The popularity of these ETFs might greatly improve the situation of Bitcoin on the market. Building on the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and the more crypto friendly Trump administration, this year could mark a turning point for other cryptocurrency ETFs. There are currently over 10 ETF applications, including Solana (SOL) and XRP, pending review by the SEC for assets signalling the potential for expanded institutional interest in a broader range of digital assets. Such ETFs and other ETPs may continue to increase liquidity and stability in the blockchain and digital asset market. Stablecoins for Enterprise Adoption Last year the stablecoin market showed firm growth, triggered by the rising demand for digital assets that offer the stability of traditional fiat currencies. The stablecoin market could double in size by the end of 2025 reaching $ 400 billion, reflecting increased adoption and integration into various traditional financial systems. The stablecoin market's significant growth in 2024 and projected expansion in 2025 highlight its integral role in the digital transformation of the financial landscape. This is based on broader acceptance of digital payments, advancements in blockchain technology, and increased regulatory clarity. Stablecoins facilitating seamless transactions and acting as a hedge against the volatility commonly associated with cryptocurrencies. They also provide access to financial services for individuals in regions with limited banking infrastructure, promoting greater economic participation. More institutional interest in the crypto world This year is gearing up to be a pivotal year, especially when it comes to institutional blockchain and crypto adoption. In 2024 we already have seen a growing institutional interest in tokenised real-world assets (RWAs) and ETFs, thereby recognising cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. Major companies have already made Bitcoin and other important cryptocurrencies as part of their balance sheets, while institutional investors are starting to see digital currencies as a viable store of value Major payment networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, are incorporating blockchain technology into their operations, while major players in the financial world like Fidelity, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are entering the RWA space, signalling growing confidence in the potential of blockchain technology to transform traditional asset markets. The trend of traditional institutions entering the crypto space is expected to continue during 2025 in an accelerated way. Asset managers, hedge funds, and large corporations will likely increase their exposure to crypto assets as part of diversified portfolios. Institutional adoption is expected to reach new heights.T he volume of institutional crypto investments could surpass the $500 billion mark, driven by demand for regulated investment vehicles, including ETFs and structured products. As institutional investors continue to show interest, we may see further innovations in cryptocurrency-related products, such as bitcoin loans. These types of loans allow institutions and individuals to leverage their crypto holdings without selling them, offering a more efficient way to access liquidity. II Arrival of new blockchain services Other interesting trends to expect in 2025 is the growing adoption of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) and the arrival of new blockchain related services such as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Growing Adoption of Blockchain-as-a-Service (Baas) Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud based platform with which companies may implement and use blockchain solutions. In 2024, BaaS matured significantly, becoming a key component for businesses looking to leverage blockchain technology without the complexity of developing and the need of managing their own complex infrastructure. By simplifying the acceptance of blockchain BaaS trends in the technology. Accessibility and accessibility will be stimulated. BaaS will become an important trend in 2025, where big technology companies such as Microsoft and Amazon offer blockchain services (infrastructure and maintenance). With BaaS companies may chose the most suitable blockchain protocol for their needs. Going forward, more companies might adopt BaaS platforms, which could lead to increased application in supply chain management, finance and health care. Launch of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are another significant trend on the horizon. These government-backed digital currencies aim to enhance payment systems, reduce transaction costs and increase financial inclusion. They have become a focal point in the financial world. 2025 is poised to be their breakout year. Central banks worldwide are exploring or piloting CBDCs as a way to digitize their national currencies to enhance monetary control, streamline payments and reduce dependence on cash. This year multiple countries are expected to have launched fully operational CBDCs. They could be available in over 20 countries, including China, India and the EU each utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate secure, efficient transactions. I however just heard that Trump will put an end to all CBDC activities by the Fed in the US. CBDCs are expected to coexist alongside existing decentralised cryptocurrencies, though they will operate within more centralised frameworks, providing a stable digital currency for everyday transactions. The coexistence of CBDCs and decentralized cryptocurrencies will present unique dynamics. While CBDCs offer stability and government backing, decentralized cryptocurrencies provide greater privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship. Balancing these features will likely define the financial landscape of 2025 and further. III Technology innovations: Solving blockchain challenges During 2025 we will also see accelerated technology activities to solve the various blockchain challenges that restrict blockchain adoption including interoperability, scalability, security, privacy and sustainability. solutions .These challenges are increasingly being addressed for the blockchain technology to reach its full potential Layer 2 solutions are revolutionizing DeFi This year we will see is the accelerated emergence of Layer 2 solutions. These solutions address the scaling and interoperability issues of blockchain networks, enhancing scalability and facilitate integration between blockchains, which hold immense potential to transform the crypto ecosystem. A persistent obstacle has been the siloed nature of blockchains. Interoperability solutions may break through these barriers by building bridges between different blockchain eco-systems, enabling seamless interactions across different networks. Several platforms and developers are working on solving this challenge by building interoperable solutions to connect multiple blockchains. This reduces the complexity for users who wish to interact with multiple cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dApps). This process will be accelerated in 2025. Projects like Polkadot and Cosmos use Relais chains and hubs to let communicate blockchains with each other, bridging previously isolated ecosystems. This approach makes it easier for developers to create secure, interoperable smart contracts that operate seamlessly across multiple chains. We will also see increased use of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable decentralized applications to interact across chains with minimal friction, improving both usability and composability. As blockchain continues to be onboarded and integrated within corporations across various sectors network multiple Layer-2 scaling applications have more recently come to market, enabling lower latency and higher transaction throughput. This lets data and assets move easily between different blockchains. By 2025, advancements in layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Ethereum’s rollups and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, are expected to significantly enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs. With Layer 2 integration, transaction fees are expected to decrease, making the network more accessible for users, attracting more DeFi and NFT projects. L2 solutions may also introduce smart contract functionality, facilitating the adoption of decentralized applications, making DeFi accessible to a wider audience. This is driving a new wave of DeFi growth paving the way for a robust DeFi ecosystem built around cryptocurrencies. Improved Security and Privacy Features As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, security and privacy concerns will continue to be a focal point. More severe data privacy regulation worldwide would lead to stronger integration of privacy improving technologies making blockchain a trustful and more conform solution in various segments including finance, healthcare and identity verification. In 2025 we may expect to see increased innovation in security protocols, such as more robust encryption methods, decentralized identity solutions, and multi-signature authentication. Advancements in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will introduce new layers of security, privacy and functionality to blockchain systems. Privacy protocols will play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem by providing secure, non-custodial trading options. Privacy related technologies are likely to become more widely used, enabling users to transact with greater privacy, which is an important consideration for both individual and institutional users. Green Crypto Projects and Regenerative Finance (ReFi) Environmental sustainability has become a critical concern in the crypto industry. The environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) mining, has led to growing interest in green crypto solutions. As governments and environmental groups push for more sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency space is exploring eco-friendly solutions. Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) has set a trend for sustainable crypto practices, and other networks are promoting eco-friendly approaches. In 2025 the market is expected to witness a significant shift towards eco-friendly solutions, with more blockchains change over to POS while other energy-efficient consensus mechanisms are gaining traction. Additionally, projects that promote renewable energy for mining operations are becoming more common. The way the cryptocurrency business tackles environmental issues is being transformed by Regenerative Finance (ReFi). In addition to promoting sustainability, these programs are actively working to restore the environment. ReFi aims to address this by funding ecological restoration projects through blockchain. With public and private partnerships focusing on green technology, ReFi projects may become a cornerstone of crypto’s future. Leading the change are projects utilizing carbon-negative mechanisms and renewable energy-powered mining operations. This year we may see a significant shift toward green(er) cryptocurrencies, that could also lead to the development of crypto loan products that focus on supporting environmentally sustainable projects, opening new opportunities for eco-conscious investors. IV Blockchain integration with other technologies Other fundamental trends we may see in 2025 is the increasing merger of blockchain with other technologies of which Artificial Intelligence (AI) and WEB3 are the most prominent ones. Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain: A new tech narrative One of the most exciting trends in cryptocurrency is the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. They are converging in unprecedented ways, shaping the future of decentralised systems. This merger is poised to accelerate in 2025. AI-driven crypto projects are expected to experience significant growth in various sectors, demonstrating the potential of AI in driving crypto innovation, thereby introducing new opportunities for investors and creating novel solutions for industries across the globe. More sophisticated AI applications will likely emerge, potentially disrupting established systems, such as decentralised AI platforms, On-chain AI agent activity, ID checks and DePIN.. Decentralized AI platforms, which facilitate machine learning models powered by blockchain, are gaining attention. These platforms incentivize data sharing and model training in a decentralized, transparent way. Machine learning algorithms are being deployed to enhance smart contracts, secure networks, and optimise consensus mechanisms. Decentralized artificial intelligence (deAI) is set to reshape how AI operates by leveraging blockchain to distribute computation and data storage across a decentralized network. DeAI leverages blockchain to address data privacy concerns and enable distributed computing, creating a novel economic model. DeAI enhances transparency, security and privacy. This year we are likely to see more decentralized platforms that utilize AI-powered tokens to improve everything from supply chain management to security protocols. One of the most compelling narratives that will gain massive traction in 2025 is the integration of AI agents into the crypto ecosystem, extending beyond decentralized finance (DeFi) into diverse sectors. These specialized AI bots are designed to understand user intent and execute complex operations in dApps, streamlining processes transactions across various applications, thereby optimizing results by autonomously adapting their strategies. Several protocols have been working on ways to provide ID verification on chain over the past few years. One of the advancements in this field is undoubtedly the emergence of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, a technology that allows a human to prove themselves without revealing any personal information. One of the most promising applications of AI in cryptocurrencies to capture investor and user interest will be the development of DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), built on physical devices such as sensors and cameras. DePIN projects integrate blockchain technology with physical infrastructure, such as telecommunications, transportation, and energy. These projects aim to decentralize traditional industries by rewarding participants via digital tokens for providing resources and real services Web3 and DeFi: The New Financial Frontier Another technology trend we will see in 2025 is Web3, the decentralized version of the internet, further integrate blockchain technology into everyday applications. Increased demand for decentralized solutions underscores the need for a transparent, secure internet ecosystem. This integration is expected to reshape digital experiences by promoting user control and data privacy. Web3 and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) are set to change global finance by 2025. As DeFi expands, institutional adoption rises, and Web3 matures, the cryptocurrency landscape will likely undergo significant changes. With decentralized applications (dApps) gaining popularity, Web3 promises a new internet model where users interact on peer-to-peer networks. Everyone will have more options for managing money, getting loans, and making international deals. This shift could lead to more innovation and challenge old banking ways. V Regulatory Clarity: A Catalyst for Crypto Growth Regulation remains a key challenge and opportunity for the cryptocurrency market. As the crypto market expands and firms are increasingly embracing and invest in crypto, there is increasing need of regulatory clarity. Governments around the world, recognizing the growing role of crypto assets in the economy, are actively working on crypto regulation. They are creating frameworks and rules that will allow for safer, more secure crypto transactions. Various jurisdictions thereby are still taking different approaches. By 2025, global regulatory frameworks however are expected to be more cohesive, addressing issues such as anti-money laundering (AML), consumer protection, and environmental sustainability. The future of crypto regulation will likely focus on balancing innovation with consumer protection, making trading safer and more transparent. Investors are betting that the Trump presidency will be much more crypto-friendly than the Biden administration. Clear regulatory rules and guidelines for crypto assets and platforms, could bring increased institutional investment into the crypto space, accelerating its integration into global financial systems. VI Integration of Blockchain Technology in Traditional Finance All these developments are a signal that the bridging of traditional finance and digital assets is inevitable. Tokenized RWAs and stablecoins are poised to gain mainstream acceptance and become a cornerstone of modern finance. This mix of traditional finance and decentralised finance is changing the financial and banking world. Blockchain technology will increasingly be integrated into traditional financial systems. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are changing how banks work. We are likely to see banks offering crypto loan products, allowing customers to borrow against their digital assets while maintaining access to traditional banking services. This integration of blockchain into traditional finance could also result in hybrid financial products that combine the best aspects of both worlds—decentralization and regulatory oversight. With major players in FinTech, like PayPal and Visa, already integrating cryptocurrencies into their platforms and experimenting with stablecoins, real-world use cases could soon become a common mode of transaction. Forward thinking: redefining the traditional financial landscape Looking ahead the world of cryptocurrency is set for big changes, undergoing profound transformations. It holds significant potential for the expansive growth and further development of the cryptocurrency industry. Trends like mainstream crypto adoption, growing institutional interest and the integration of blockchain in traditional finance will redefine the financial landscape. But also continued advancements and innovations in blockchain technology and increasing regulatory clarity all are set to become key drivers for crypto to reshape traditional finance and create a more integrated financial world of both decentralised finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi).

These government-backed digital currencies aim to enhance payment systems, reduce transaction costs and increase financial inclusion. They have become a focal point in the financial world. 2025 is poised to be their breakout year. Central banks worldwide are exploring or piloting CBDCs as a way to digitize their national currencies to enhance monetary control, streamline payments and reduce dependence on cash. This year multiple countries are expected to have launched fully operational CBDCs. They could be available in over 20 countries, including China, India and the EU each utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate secure, efficient transactions. I however just heard that Trump will put an end to all CBDC activities by the Fed in the US. CBDCs are expected to coexist alongside existing decentralised cryptocurrencies, though they will operate within more centralised frameworks, providing a stable digital currency for everyday transactions. The coexistence of CBDCs and decentralized cryptocurrencies will present unique dynamics. While CBDCs offer stability and government backing, decentralized cryptocurrencies provide greater privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship. Balancing these features will likely define the financial landscape of 2025 and further. III Technology innovations: Solving blockchain challenges During 2025 we will also see accelerated technology activities to solve the various blockchain challenges that restrict blockchain adoption including interoperability, scalability, security, privacy and sustainability. solutions .These challenges are increasingly being addressed for the blockchain technology to reach its full potential Layer 2 solutions are revolutionizing DeFi This year we will see is the accelerated emergence of Layer 2 solutions. These solutions address the scaling and interoperability issues of blockchain networks, enhancing scalability and facilitate integration between blockchains, which hold immense potential to transform the crypto ecosystem. A persistent obstacle has been the siloed nature of blockchains. Interoperability solutions may break through these barriers by building bridges between different blockchain eco-systems, enabling seamless interactions across different networks. Several platforms and developers are working on solving this challenge by building interoperable solutions to connect multiple blockchains. This reduces the complexity for users who wish to interact with multiple cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dApps). This process will be accelerated in 2025. Projects like Polkadot and Cosmos use Relais chains and hubs to let communicate blockchains with each other, bridging previously isolated ecosystems. This approach makes it easier for developers to create secure, interoperable smart contracts that operate seamlessly across multiple chains. We will also see increased use of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable decentralized applications to interact across chains with minimal friction, improving both usability and composability. As blockchain continues to be onboarded and integrated within corporations across various sectors network multiple Layer-2 scaling applications have more recently come to market, enabling lower latency and higher transaction throughput. This lets data and assets move easily between different blockchains. By 2025, advancements in layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Ethereum’s rollups and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, are expected to significantly enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs. With Layer 2 integration, transaction fees are expected to decrease, making the network more accessible for users, attracting more DeFi and NFT projects. L2 solutions may also introduce smart contract functionality, facilitating the adoption of decentralized applications, making DeFi accessible to a wider audience. This is driving a new wave of DeFi growth paving the way for a robust DeFi ecosystem built around cryptocurrencies. Improved Security and Privacy Features As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, security and privacy concerns will continue to be a focal point. More severe data privacy regulation worldwide would lead to stronger integration of privacy improving technologies making blockchain a trustful and more conform solution in various segments including finance, healthcare and identity verification. In 2025 we may expect to see increased innovation in security protocols, such as more robust encryption methods, decentralized identity solutions, and multi-signature authentication. Advancements in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will introduce new layers of security, privacy and functionality to blockchain systems. Privacy protocols will play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem by providing secure, non-custodial trading options. Privacy related technologies are likely to become more widely used, enabling users to transact with greater privacy, which is an important consideration for both individual and institutional users. Green Crypto Projects and Regenerative Finance (ReFi) Environmental sustainability has become a critical concern in the crypto industry. The environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) mining, has led to growing interest in green crypto solutions. As governments and environmental groups push for more sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency space is exploring eco-friendly solutions. Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) has set a trend for sustainable crypto practices, and other networks are promoting eco-friendly approaches. In 2025 the market is expected to witness a significant shift towards eco-friendly solutions, with more blockchains change over to POS while other energy-efficient consensus mechanisms are gaining traction. Additionally, projects that promote renewable energy for mining operations are becoming more common. The way the cryptocurrency business tackles environmental issues is being transformed by Regenerative Finance (ReFi). In addition to promoting sustainability, these programs are actively working to restore the environment. ReFi aims to address this by funding ecological restoration projects through blockchain. With public and private partnerships focusing on green technology, ReFi projects may become a cornerstone of crypto’s future. Leading the change are projects utilizing carbon-negative mechanisms and renewable energy-powered mining operations. This year we may see a significant shift toward green(er) cryptocurrencies, that could also lead to the development of crypto loan products that focus on supporting environmentally sustainable projects, opening new opportunities for eco-conscious investors. IV Blockchain integration with other technologies Other fundamental trends we may see in 2025 is the increasing merger of blockchain with other technologies of which Artificial Intelligence (AI) and WEB3 are the most prominent ones. Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain: A new tech narrative One of the most exciting trends in cryptocurrency is the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. They are converging in unprecedented ways, shaping the future of decentralised systems. This merger is poised to accelerate in 2025. AI-driven crypto projects are expected to experience significant growth in various sectors, demonstrating the potential of AI in driving crypto innovation, thereby introducing new opportunities for investors and creating novel solutions for industries across the globe. More sophisticated AI applications will likely emerge, potentially disrupting established systems, such as decentralised AI platforms, On-chain AI agent activity, ID checks and DePIN.. Decentralized AI platforms, which facilitate machine learning models powered by blockchain, are gaining attention. These platforms incentivize data sharing and model training in a decentralized, transparent way. Machine learning algorithms are being deployed to enhance smart contracts, secure networks, and optimise consensus mechanisms. Decentralized artificial intelligence (deAI) is set to reshape how AI operates by leveraging blockchain to distribute computation and data storage across a decentralized network. DeAI leverages blockchain to address data privacy concerns and enable distributed computing, creating a novel economic model. DeAI enhances transparency, security and privacy. This year we are likely to see more decentralized platforms that utilize AI-powered tokens to improve everything from supply chain management to security protocols. One of the most compelling narratives that will gain massive traction in 2025 is the integration of AI agents into the crypto ecosystem, extending beyond decentralized finance (DeFi) into diverse sectors. These specialized AI bots are designed to understand user intent and execute complex operations in dApps, streamlining processes transactions across various applications, thereby optimizing results by autonomously adapting their strategies. Several protocols have been working on ways to provide ID verification on chain over the past few years. One of the advancements in this field is undoubtedly the emergence of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, a technology that allows a human to prove themselves without revealing any personal information. One of the most promising applications of AI in cryptocurrencies to capture investor and user interest will be the development of DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), built on physical devices such as sensors and cameras. DePIN projects integrate blockchain technology with physical infrastructure, such as telecommunications, transportation, and energy. These projects aim to decentralize traditional industries by rewarding participants via digital tokens for providing resources and real services Web3 and DeFi: The New Financial Frontier Another technology trend we will see in 2025 is Web3, the decentralized version of the internet, further integrate blockchain technology into everyday applications. Increased demand for decentralized solutions underscores the need for a transparent, secure internet ecosystem. This integration is expected to reshape digital experiences by promoting user control and data privacy. Web3 and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) are set to change global finance by 2025. As DeFi expands, institutional adoption rises, and Web3 matures, the cryptocurrency landscape will likely undergo significant changes. With decentralized applications (dApps) gaining popularity, Web3 promises a new internet model where users interact on peer-to-peer networks. Everyone will have more options for managing money, getting loans, and making international deals. This shift could lead to more innovation and challenge old banking ways. V Regulatory Clarity: A Catalyst for Crypto Growth Regulation remains a key challenge and opportunity for the cryptocurrency market. As the crypto market expands and firms are increasingly embracing and invest in crypto, there is increasing need of regulatory clarity. Governments around the world, recognizing the growing role of crypto assets in the economy, are actively working on crypto regulation. They are creating frameworks and rules that will allow for safer, more secure crypto transactions. Various jurisdictions thereby are still taking different approaches. By 2025, global regulatory frameworks however are expected to be more cohesive, addressing issues such as anti-money laundering (AML), consumer protection, and environmental sustainability. The future of crypto regulation will likely focus on balancing innovation with consumer protection, making trading safer and more transparent. Investors are betting that the Trump presidency will be much more crypto-friendly than the Biden administration. Clear regulatory rules and guidelines for crypto assets and platforms, could bring increased institutional investment into the crypto space, accelerating its integration into global financial systems. VI Integration of Blockchain Technology in Traditional Finance All these developments are a signal that the bridging of traditional finance and digital assets is inevitable. Tokenized RWAs and stablecoins are poised to gain mainstream acceptance and become a cornerstone of modern finance. This mix of traditional finance and decentralised finance is changing the financial and banking world. Blockchain technology will increasingly be integrated into traditional financial systems. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are changing how banks work. We are likely to see banks offering crypto loan products, allowing customers to borrow against their digital assets while maintaining access to traditional banking services. This integration of blockchain into traditional finance could also result in hybrid financial products that combine the best aspects of both worlds—decentralization and regulatory oversight. With major players in FinTech, like PayPal and Visa, already integrating cryptocurrencies into their platforms and experimenting with stablecoins, real-world use cases could soon become a common mode of transaction. Forward thinking: redefining the traditional financial landscape Looking ahead the world of cryptocurrency is set for big changes, undergoing profound transformations. It holds significant potential for the expansive growth and further development of the cryptocurrency industry. Trends like mainstream crypto adoption, growing institutional interest and the integration of blockchain in traditional finance will redefine the financial landscape. But also continued advancements and innovations in blockchain technology and increasing regulatory clarity all are set to become key drivers for crypto to reshape traditional finance and create a more integrated financial world of both decentralised finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi).

Title: Ethereum at $3.3K – Does THIS historical pattern indicate a bullish breakout?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-at-3-3k-does-this-historical-pattern-indicate-a-bullish-breakout/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T07:30:36Z
Full Content:
Some analysts maintain that altcoins could still outperform Bitcoin despite a delayed start of the rally. Per the Ethereum [ETH] MVRV Pricing Bands, each bullish cycle saw ETH surpass the 3.2 MVRV Pricing Band, indicating strong investor optimism and market momentum during these periods. At press time, ETH’s price was at $3,330, which was significantly below the 3.2 MVRV band priced at $6,770. This discrepancy suggested that while ETH was valued reasonably in terms of its historical realized price, it hasn’t reached the euphoric valuation peaks as in past bullish cycles. The bands at lower MVRV ratios, like 0.8, 1.0, and 2.4, sit at $1,693.33, $2,116.66, and $5,080.00 respectively, serving as potential support levels during market retractions. Source: Ali Charts/X Considering this, ETH could see significant upside potential if it approaches and surpasses the 3.2 band in future bullish conditions. This would not only reflect growing market confidence but also suggest a possible continuation of ETH’s uptrend in coming cycles. Additionally, ETH’s resistance indicated critical turning points where ETH either faced a pullback or a breakthrough. Breaking past this, then followed by a substantial uptrend, could suggest a bullish continuation. Ethereum appeared to be approaching this level once again, which could trigger a rally towards $6770. This move could be in line with historical cycles where Ethereum gathered significant momentum after crossing the MVRV threshold. Source: TradingView A successful break past the resistance could lead to a surge in buying activity. This is supported by the fact that BlackRock now holds over 1.2M ETH through its Spot ETF, while Fidelity’s FETH holds 432K ETH and Bitwise’s ETHW holds 105K ETH. The inflows suggest rising institutional demand. Finally, analysts are having different views on ETH, probably because of the delayed altseason. Michael van de Poppe called it the “most hated rally” suggesting a surprising bullish run, one that market sentiment did not initially favor. Also, Joao Wedson noted that altcoins have already dropped significantly, so it’s likely that many will recover and outperform Bitcoin. This predicted rally could coincide with a growing interest in “real utility coins,” or cryptos that offer functional, real-world applications. Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2025–2026 As institutional interest in utility-focused tokens increases, their adoption could boost demand for Ethereum, given its key role in the blockchain ecosystem. As ETH approaches the MVRV value again in 2025, sustaining institutional embracement could lead to a strong uptrend, defying initial market skepticism and solidifying its position in both market valuation and utility.

U.S. stocks notched back-to-back weekly gains last week and although the rally paused on Friday, the S&P 500 still hit a fresh record during the day. It comes after the U.S. leader called for lower interest rates and cheaper oil prices in a Thursday address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Investors have also been betting on potential tax cuts and deregulation under the new president, sending stocks higher. Not everyone is bullish looking ahead, however, with some — such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon — suggesting markets could be overpriced. After a week of interviews with business leaders, lawmakers and investors in the Swiss ski resort, here's what top industry names told CNBC: "I'm cautiously optimistic — that being said I have scenarios where it could be pretty bad," Fink told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin. "I believe if we were to unlock all this private capital we're going to have enormous growth, [but], at the same time, some of this is going to unlock new inflationary pressures," he explained. "And I do believe that's the risk that is not factored into the market." Pick said he believed corporate earnings could lift growth in markets over the next 12 to 24 months as they "continue to be strong." "That is kind of the indicator … How many companies right now are really talking about recession, how many are talking about inflation? I feel like the earnings pull through looks pretty sanguine," he said. "More importantly, I know we like to look at the index, but the index is dominated by half a dozen technology companies — which, by the way are all doing great — but if you look at the deregulation possibilities in the energy sector, in the financial services sector, those sectors are still in multiples that aren't that expensive," Pick added. "If you're an investor and you think about allocating over the next 12 to 18 months, sure there could be a drawdown at the index level, but [do] you really want to be thinking about where do I have sector exposure?" Lagarde told Karen Tso that there was divergence in monetary policy between the euro area and the U.S. due to a "different economic setting." She also said that she was not "overly concerned" about the risk that inflation abroad will be imported into Europe, adding that she expected the ECB will continue to gradually lower interest rates as the price growth rate moves toward target. "We are certainly interested to see the U.S. grow, because growth in the U.S. has always been a favorable factor for the rest of the world," Lagarde said. "I don't think you should give any advice to the U.S., but if you look at the risk to financial markets, I think inflation is for sure one, all driven by tariffs," Tangen said Tuesday. "Geopolitical tensions generally are negative for financial markets and for financial returns." Tangen added that "purely financially," Trump's arrival was going to be "very positive" for a lot of U.S. companies. Dimon said he thinks U.S. asset prices are "kind of inflated" at their current levels. "By any measure, they are in the top 10% or 15%," Dimon told Andrew Ross Sorkin on Wednesday, referring to U.S. stock markets. "They're elevated and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices. "We're all hoping for that, and having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there and they can tend to surprise you," he added. Solomon said markets were in risk-on mode and that there was a sense of optimism in equities both because of the new U.S. administration and because of advances in technology. Solomon also told Andrew Ross Sorkin that he was noticing a focus on growth, in the U.S., as well as in his conversations with European clients at Davos. "I think people are optimistic, and it's not going to be a smooth, perfect path, but people are optimistic that we are going to run a more growth-prone agenda. We're going to free up some investment, we're going to unlock the private sector a little but more, and that's got to be constructive," he said. "It's hard to dispute the fact that equity multiples are high ... I think the equity markets exhibit a sense of optimism at the moment, but they also exhibit a sense of optimism around growth and technology, in particular this AI wave. Of course it's not going to be a straight line, but some of the technology we're seeing, the opportunities for that technology to improve productivity meaningfully are extraordinary." "Continuing on the trends we've seen in 2024 being a positive year in most markets … I see that continuing in 2025, I see a continuation of strong tailwinds in the in the core markets, the U.S., Asia, particularly the growth driven markets in Asia," al-Mubarak told CNBC's Dan Murphy Monday. "I see a continuation of good tailwinds in technology and healthcare and financial services, life sciences," he added. "So I would say, maybe almost the same words I used last year: cautiously optimistic. When I look at 2025, it's going to be an exciting year." Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio told CNBC that price-earnings ratios were high in U.S. markets, but that there could be further scope to climb in artificial intelligence beneficiaries. "We have gone pretty far already ...I think it's led by the sectors that are great sectors, the disruptors, AI and so on." "I don't think it's been carried down to the applications of AI, to the uses of AI ... the applications of AI are under-discounted I think." Moynihan told Andrew Ross Sorkin on Tuesday he thought U.S. markets had room to climb in 2025, and that the key concern for business and financial services would be regulatory policy, rather than inflation. "Our research team thinks there's room to go this year, they predict the market to go up. Not as much as last year, and the unusual thing is you had a couple years in a row of very strong growth, but that was coming off a couple years of very unusual times," he said. Moynihan added, "I believe that if you look at the key thing for businesses generally, including financial services and the banking businesses, it's the regulation question." Tariffs proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump could prevent disinflation and keep interest rates higher, the banking chief told Andrew Ross Sorkin on Tuesday. "Inflation is much more sticky than we have been saying," Ermotti said. "Tariffs will probably not really help inflation to come down. And therefore I don't see [interest] rates coming down as fast as people believe," he said. Venkatakrishnan, whose British bank makes around 40% of its revenue in the U.S., said he was "optimistic" about U.S. deal activity this year. "I think there are two things driving it. One is interest rates have reached a relatively stable level. Our own economists are calling for maybe one rate cut in the U.S. over the next year," he told Andrew Ross Sorkin. "They're still high, but they're stable, so you can at least plan better, because you don't have the volatility in rates. The second is with the change in [U.S.] administration, it should be easier for mergers to take place." Venkatakrishnan added that he expected President Trump to relax regulation, which would be "generally good for business sentiment and good for business opportunity." The U.K. needs to attract more oversees investment to boost economic growth, Reeves told CNBC. "My message to U.S. investors and global investors too is: Britain is open for business, we want your investment." She also discussed Trump's global tariff threats. "I do understand that President Trump is concerned about countries that are running large and persistent surpluses on the trade balance with the U.S. That's not the case for the U.K.," Reeves said. "We are not part of the problem here. So we, the U.K., increased trade with President Trump last time he was in office." Sinding, CEO of Swedish private equity firm EQT, told CNBC's Karen Tso and Steve Sedgwick on the ground that the market for M&A and big business deals was "continuing to improve." "We had a record year in 2024 we did over $20 billion of investments," he said. "We did more than $10 billion of exits, and that's kind of building up to 2025, [when] I think a lot of the market participants are now ready to transact, whether it's private equity or family offices or strategic buyers. And, of course, if you look at the global capital markets, the IPO market is wide open. The credit markets are strong, so we're fairly positive looking into the next year."

Title: Trump is searching for potential TikTok buyers

President Donald Trump wants a US investor to take a major stake in ByteDance’s TikTok. Several parties are in contention even as potential buyers face a litany of legal hurdles and barriers. After stepping in to restore TikTok in the US and delaying a law that would effectively ban the app, Mr Trump is looking for avenues to keep the popular platform afloat. He has put forward a proposal for an American stakeholder to buy the company and then sell a 50 per cent stake to the US government, which will jointly run the app along with the private party. Mr Trump reportedly said Saturday that he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and that he would likely decide on its future in the next 30 days. So, who are the likely contenders for one of the most popular apps in the U.S.? Mr Trump has already flagged several major investors within his inner circle as acceptable buyers, one of which is Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk. The world’s richest person is leading Mr Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency, has close business ties to China and has voiced opposition to the TikTok ban. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that the Chinese government was considering a plan to have Mr Musk acquire TikTok’s US operations, citing anonymous sources. That followed a report from the Wall Street Journal, which claimed TikTok’s chief executive had been soliciting advice from Mr Musk ahead of Trump’s inauguration. CNBC was unable to reach Mr Musk for comment. “Elon Musk continues to be front and centre as a potential bidder for TikTok which likely includes some tech partners/outside investors to get a deal done,” financial services company Wedbush Securities said in a research note on Wednesday. “Musk would be hand picked by Beijing and his ironclad relationship with Trump would make this a very logical choice in our view,” the note added. Nat Schindler, an analyst at Scotiabank, also noted that Mr Musk’s acquisition of Twitter has demonstrated his interest in global social media platforms. However, he also sees some potential obstacles for the tech tycoon. “Musk is under fire already for owning X and the perception that he is using it to promote certain political ideas, and any involvement in TikTok could draw additional fire and potentially antitrust scrutiny,” Ms Schindler said. Mr Trump has also said he’d “like” to see Oracle chairman Larry Ellison purchase the platform. Mr Ellison, a longtime Trump supporter, stood beside the President at a press conference on his AI infrastructure investment plans last Tuesday, where Mr Trump was asked questions about a potential TikTok deal. “What I’m thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half and we’ll give you the permit,” Mr Trump said before turning to Mr Ellison to ask if the deal sounded reasonable. “Sounds like a good deal to me Mr President,” Mr Ellison replied. Mr Ellison and his company are currently at the centre of the TikTok dilemma, operating as a cloud infrastructure provider for ByteDance in the US. Given its existing relationship with TikTok, Oracle and is “directly invested in TikTok’s success in the region,” Scotiabank’s Ms Schindler said. Mr Ellison had bid for TikTok, along with Walmart, back in 2020 when Mr Trump first pushed for a ban on the platform. Neither company responded to CNBC’s request for comment. Mr Trump had approved of the Walmart-Oracle deal in principle, which would’ve seen the tech and retail giants partner to take over the video-sharing app in the US, avoiding a shutdown. However, the Trump administration’s attempt to ban TikTok in the US fell through in the face of legal challenges. Mr Ellison later joined a group of investors that helped Mr Musk buy social media platform Twitter, now known as X, in 2022. ″[We believe] Oracle/Ellison could play a pivotal role in any deal given their key technology partnership with TikTok and his appearance at the White House with Project Stargate,” Wedbush said. Wedbush added that it expects a slew of TikTok bids to come over the coming weeks from a host of players with Mr Musk and Mr Ellison leading the pack. According to a National Public Radio report on Saturday, the Trump administration is working on a plan to save TikTok that would involve Oracle and a group of outside investors effectively taking control of it global operations. California-based artificial intelligence search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid for TikTok to ByteDance on January 18, as it seeks to create a new merged entity combining Perplexity, TikTok US and new capital partners, CNBC learned. Following Mr Trump’s comments on a TikTok deal structure, the AI company revised its merger proposal on Sunday to also allow for the US government to own up to 50 per cent of the new company upon future IPO, according to a proposal document seen by CNBC. The document proposes ByteDance offer TikTok US, without its recommendation algorithm, in exchange for the company’s existing investors receiving equity in the merged company. The deal would reportedly bring more video to Perplexity — recently valued at about $US9 billion ($14.3b) — as it gains increasing investor interest amid the generative AI boom and competes with OpenAI and Google. Experts flagged several other parties likely to be interested in a potential deal for TikTok, adding that the barriers to entry were high. Given the financial stakes of a TikTok deal, it’s unlikely that some rogue investor is going to swoop in and buy the platform on the cheap, Paul Triolo of Albright Stone Group told CNBC. “While an up-to-date valuation on TikTok is difficult to come up with, it is likely to the order of $US40b-$US80b, meaning whoever decides to jump in has to be ready with some serious money,” he said. He added that potential suitors are likely to include some of America’s largest social media and technology players, such as Meta and Google, in addition to Mr Musk’s X. Meta and Google didn’t immediately respond to a CNBC inquiry. Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, however, warned that players such as Meta, Google and Mr Musk getting a substantial stake in TikTok could raise antitrust questions. Ms Schindler noted that there were also a number of other players, including existing investors BlackRock, Coatue, and General Atlantic, who own a large chunk of TikTok’s parent company. According to him, some of these investors are likely to participate in any sale of the US platform by investing in the new entity. “Other large VCs, hedge funds, and asset managers from Tiger to Fidelity would also likely show interest in a fast growing global platform with such a huge viewer base,” said Schindler, adding that finding investors to own a part of Tiktok won’t be a problem. The fervour surrounding a purchase of TikTok US has also seen some unconventional players enter the fray. Social media superstar MrBeast — real name Jimmy Donaldson — who has more than 100 million TikTok followers has posted several videos in which he indicated serious interest in buying the platform, claiming he has had talks with billionaires. In one video, the internet personality claimed he had an official offer ready, jesting that he might be the new TikTok CEO. Media reports have also mentioned Mr Donaldson and a group of investors preparing to make a bid for TikTok. On Thursday, Matthew Hiltzik, a spokesperson for Mr Donaldson, told CNBC that: “Several potential buyers are in ongoing discussions with Jimmy, but he has no exclusive agreements with any of them.” Led by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt and involving Canadian businessman and TV personality Kevin O’Leary, The People’s Bid for TikTok, has made a $US20b cash offer to buy TikTok. Mr O’Leary told CNBC last year that he wanted to buy the platform at a discount as any possible deal won’t include TikTok’s original algorithm. The organisation said it already has a replacement for the algorithm to use for TikTok US. Following Mr Trump’s comments on a 50 per cent stake in the platform, both Mr McCourt and Mr O’Leary told CNBC this week that they were interested in a TikTok deal and were hoping to work with Mr Trump to make it happen. Mr McCourt has also told CNBC that he wants TikTok to run a decentralised social networking protocol, or DSNP, overseen by the Project Liberty Institute, a non-profit founded by the billionaire. Bidding interest aside, a number of legal and tech experts have told CNBC that Mr Trump’s executive order to delay the TikTok ban contradicts the Supreme Court’s earlier ruling to uphold the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and could face legal opposition. Mr O’Leary also told CNBC last Monday that a TikTok deal could not happen under the current law, after the Supreme Court upheld an impending ban on TikTok under the Act on Sunday. Beijing and its pending negotiations with Mr Trump regarding trade with the US is also expected to play a determining factor in whether the Chinese government would allow ByteDance to make a divestiture. “In this game of high stakes poker between the Trump administration and Beijing it’s clear TikTok is a big chip on the table,” Wedush said.

Posted on 01/26/2025 4:56:07 PM PST by ChicagoConservative27 Former ‘Million Dollar Listing’ star and Los Angeles real estate agent Josh Altman said Friday on Fox Business Network’s “Varney Co.” a lack of adequate home insurance was the main reason 70% of Pacific Palisades residents won’t return. Guest host David Asman said, “I heard a figure 70% of Palisades residents would not return after the fires there. What does that mean for the county?” Altman said, Yeah, David, thanks for having me again. I want to preface that statement and explain it a little bit. They’re not gonna not return because they don’t want to return. Of course, they want to go back there. For every one person leaving the Palisades, there’s another five that would love to be there.” (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...

Speculators will buy up the land and put up high density/low income housing increasing the value of other exclusive neighborhoods. I feel for these people but I feel more for the NC folks. Fill the reservoir. Problem solved. All the new houses can be Mediterranean. “living in a fire prone habitat” It wouldn’t be bad if government did its job. But that applies to crime, taxes, etc. in CA. Except Trump said every single person he talked to in Pacific Palisades not only wanted to build back, not only wanted to stay there and go nowhere else.....but they were ready to build back tomorrow. That’s why he and the mayor got into it. The residents want to begin clearing their lots now and don’t want any red tape. They want their new houses built now. And they have the money to do it. Not Sure this Josh knows what he is talking about. he left the show? I used to watch when I had cable. Always liked it but haven’t seen it in more than a year I’m glad you are ok Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, 81-90 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Forecasts $700K Bitcoin Price Amid Inflation Worries

EditorCrypto bitcoin, Bitcoin Magazine, Mark Mason Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has suggested that Bitcoin could reach $700,000 per coin, citing its growing role as a hedge against economic instability. His projection, sparked by a discussion with a sovereign wealth fund, highlights the increasing momentum of institutional adoption and its potential to reshape market dynamics. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, recently speculated that Bitcoin could potentially reach valuations as high as $700,000 per BTC. This projection arises against the backdrop of intensifying concerns about currency debasement and global economic instability, positioning Bitcoin as a hedge against vulnerabilities in traditional financial systems. Fink’s remark was not an outright endorsement but rather a reflection on a recent meeting he had with a sovereign wealth fund. The fund sought advice from Larry Fink on whether to allocate 2% or 5% of its investment portfolio to Bitcoin. According to Fink, if institutional adoption continues to grow and similar allocation strategies are embraced broadly, market dynamics could drive Bitcoin to such remarkable heights. Fink made this striking statement during a recent interview, explaining that Bitcoin’s potential for exponential growth is closely tied to fears of economic downturns and fiat currency devaluation. Fink described Bitcoin as an “international instrument” capable of mitigating localized economic fears. JUST IN: $11.5 trillion BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says Bitcoin could go up to $700,000 if there is more fear of currency debasement and economic instability.pic.twitter.com/WOXclAsjDP With BlackRock managing $11.5 trillion in assets, Larry Fink’s words carry significant weight, sending a clear message to retail and institutional investors alike. His endorsement transcends personal opinion, serving as a market signal about Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. Long heralded as “digital gold,” Bitcoin is seen as a store of value that can protect wealth from inflation and governmental fiscal mismanagement. Fink’s recognition of this narrative could further accelerate its adoption among traditional investors. Larry Fink’s prediction comes as global economies grapple with soaring inflation, escalating national debts, and geopolitical tensions that threaten currency stability. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins and decentralized structure, presents an alternative asset class that is immune to the inflationary pressures inherent in fiat currencies. In this climate, its value proposition becomes increasingly compelling. BLACKROCK IS BACK.THEY JUST BOUGHT $600 MILLION OF BITCOIN, THEIR LARGEST BUY SO FAR THIS YEAR. pic.twitter.com/QLAm5eaik4 BlackRock’s deepening involvement in Bitcoin reached a milestone on January 21, 2025, when the firm purchased $662 million worth of Bitcoin for its exchange-traded fund (ETF), their largest daily purchase so far this year. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) surpassed the firm’s iShares Gold Trust (IAU) in net assets in October 2024. This milestone was achieved just months after IBIT’s launch in January 2024, highlighting the rapid growth and increasing investor interest in Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds led by Larry Fink. While Larry Fink’s projection is undeniably bullish, it remains contingent on the continuation of current economic trends. If global economic stability improves or innovative financial systems emerge to alleviate fears of currency debasement, Bitcoin’s price trajectory may stabilize at a lower level. Nevertheless, Fink’s high-profile commentary underscores its growing role as a legitimate asset class. Bitcoin’s evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial instrument is accelerating. Fink’s remarks may signal a pivotal moment, not just for Bitcoin, but for its broader acceptance in traditional finance. For investors and enthusiasts, this is more than a vote of confidence—it’s a sign that the integration of Bitcoin into the global financial landscape is not only imminent but already underway. As the world watches, Larry Fink’s prediction about Bitcoin’s role in redefining finance continues to grow. Fink’s prediction serves as a reminder that Bitcoin is no longer a fringe idea but a crucial player in the future of money.

The Nasdaq Composite lost 3.07%, falling to 19,341.83, and the S&P 500 slid 1.46% to 6,012.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 289.33 points, or 0.65%, to close at 44,713.58. Gains in Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Travelers helped lift the 30-stock index. Last week, DeepSeek released R1, an open-source reasoning model that reportedly outperformed OpenAI's in several tests, and has climbed the charts at app stores. DeepSeek said the initial version of its large language model, launched in late December, cost less than $6 million to design. While Wall Street questions that figure, the startup's claims are nonetheless raising concerns that big AI models could be built out with much less investment. AI darling Nvidia dropped nearly 17%, Broadcom lost 17.4%, and AMD shed 6.4%. Microsoft lost 2.1%. Palantir was hit for 4.4%. Derivative plays from the AI buildout such as power providers also suffered. Constellation Energy lost nearly 21%, while Vistra dropped 28%. "It's a good example of selling first and asking questions later, and investors sort of feeling that valuations are a bit stretched for technology in general and for semiconductors in particular," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "We're going to have volatility, especially when we're dealing with a richly valued market and exogenous events." On the other hand, a rotation into more defensive areas of the market helped ease Monday's losses. "What I've also been encouraged by is investors are not bailing out of stocks necessarily, but are rotating into the defensive areas, like consumer staples, health care, real estate," Stovall added. "The market at least seems to be coming back." Monday's sharp declines come as traders brace for a major week, with "Magnificent Seven" members Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple all due to report their latest quarterly results. On top of that, the Federal Reserve will hold its first policy meeting of the year, deciding on the level of interest rates Wednesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a 97% chance that the central bank leaves interest rates unchanged, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch Tool. Weighed down by a technology sell-off, the Nasdaq Composite ended Monday's session lower. The technology-dominated index slipped 3.07% to finish at 19,341.83. The S&P 500 shed 1.46% and closed at 6,012.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to add 289.33 points, or 0.65%, settling at 44,713.58. — Lisa Kailai Han Even with the Nasdaq Composite down more than 3%, there are some notable tech stocks on track to close higher on the day. Shares of Salesforce were higher by more than 3%. TakeTwo Interactive and Intuit rose more than 1%. Adobe, Service Now and Palo Alto Networks were also on track for modest gains. Those moves could be a sign that cheaper versions of AI models will shift the benefit to different tech stocks. "I think the market's read today, which I generally agree with, is this is good for anyone who uses AI in their business. This is a potential cost-takeout or margin expansion opportunity for companies that use AI," said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. — Jesse Pound The risk of tariffs on China from President Donald Trump over the next couple months may not be that significant, according to Barclays. "We think the likelihood of a tariff hike in Q1 is small as President Trump ordered the USTR to assess China's performance under the Phase One deal (due 1 April) and expressed an interest in visiting China," the bank wrote in a Monday note. That said, while Barclays thinks a tariff hike within the quarter isn't likely, it's still "too early to tell" regarding what could happen in the subsequent quarters. "A review of the timeline for US-China trade war 1.0 showed that it remains to be seen how the deal making could evolve and whether and when new tariff threats would materialize," the bank added. The forecast comes as Trump revealed last week that his team is discussing a 10% tariff on China and that the tariff could be imposed as soon as Feb. 1. He had previously vowed to raise tariffs by an additional 10% on all Chinese goods back in November last year. — Sean Conlon The march of a new artificial intelligence lab in China stole a step from the market on Monday, but the number of advancing stocks still outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange in late day trading, 1481 to 1261. What's more, the number of new NYSE 52-week highs swamped new lows, 73 to 18, according to FactSet data. To be sure, declining volume accounted for nearly 55% of all NYSE volume Monday against advancing volume of 45%. But the numbers were grimmer still on the Nasdaq, where decliners swamped advancers 2565 to 1636, new lows beat new highs 133 to 109 and declining volume accounted for 71% of all shares traded. — Scott Schnipper Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, sees two more rate cuts on the horizon for 2025. "Our base case is that they cut interest rates twice this year, once in the second quarter, and then once again in the fourth quarter," he told CNBC in a Monday interview. As for this Wednesday's FOMC meeting, Stovall is in agreement with many investors who believe that the U.S. central bank will most likely hold rates steady. — Lisa Kailai Han Stifel sees three risks developing this year to threaten the current bull market rally. "First, although some investors expect a smooth hand-off from Growth-led to Value-led (from P/E to EPS), history and our economic views suggest otherwise. Second, we see Core PCE inflation stuck at 2.7% to 2.9% y/y in 2025, implying little possibility of rate cuts until GDP weakens," wrote chief equity strategist Barry Bannister. As the last negative development, Bannister pointed to an elevated U.S. Treasury 10-year yield resulting from policy and inflation, which implies that U.S. economic data could soon weaken. — Lisa Kailai Han Despite today's market selloff, Deutsche Bank believes that stocks remain relatively resilient. "As the last 24 hours have demonstrated, markets remain very sensitive to downside news," wrote strategist Henry Allen in a Monday note. "Nevertheless, periodic selloffs are a normal feature of markets, and as we look forward, several factors that could have caused issues in the recent past are now looking more positive." Still, Allen pointed to four factors that could potentially drag the bull rally down, as follows: — Lisa Kailai Han Canaccord Genuity expects a stock market pullback this quarter to set the stage for another positive year for stocks. "Last week's new closing high in the SPX for the first time in seven weeks, coupled with the slight outperformance of the SPW so far in 2025, is further evidence that the bull market that began in October 2022 remains intact," wrote analyst Michael Welch. "We continue to expect some near-term downside for the SPX and believe a Q1 low will set the stage for another positive year." The analyst added that the median quarter-one drawdown was 4.4% following a year of the S&P 500 gaining over 20%, such as 2024. However, the median calendar year gain following an outperforming year was 12.09%. — Lisa Kailai Han Single-stock ETFs that bet on Nvidia to go up every single day have become very popular, but now they are headed for their worst day on record. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF (NVDX) and the Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2x Shares ETF (NVDU) were all down about 32% in midday trading. Those funds entered the day with about $1.7 billion in combined assets under management, according to FactSet. This is what the funds are designed to do. They are built using to derivatives to deliver two-times the performance of Nvidia on a one-day basis, delivering amplified returns in either direction. On the flipside, funds that bet against Nvidia are having a banner day. The GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NVD) is up more than 30%. The short Nvidia funds all entered the day with less than $100 million in assets apiece, however. — Jesse Pound Nvidia's slide on Monday pulled shares below their respective 200-day moving average for the first time in two years. Shares are down nearly 16% on the heels of a broader sell-off in the technology sector, as China's DeepSeek seized investor attention and sparked concern that the AI trade could be losing steam. — Brian Evans, Adrian van Hauwermeiren The artificial intelligence trade has powered the bull market rally for the last two years. Investors have debated whether or not valuations have exceeded their fair prices, but UBS believes that the tech really still has more room to run. "Tech sector volatility could pick up in 2025. But we also expect robust capital spending and further progress on AI monetization, with strong earnings supporting our preferred stocks," wrote strategist Sundeep Gantori in a Monday note. "We view the U.S. IT sector as Attractive due to its promising fundamentals, and recommend investors to use any near-term volatility to build up sufficient exposure to quality AI stocks." — Lisa Kailai Han Bank of America says it's "losing hopes" on monetary policy convergence around the world. While the Federal Reserve can afford to wait before further lowering rates, uncertainty in other G10 economies means that will likely have to keep cutting. The European Central Bank is expected to cut to 1.5%, per economist Claudio Irigoyen, which will widen the rate differential with the Fed. Emerging markets, which broadly have "less anchored inflation expectations," could also see some difficult trade offs, Irigoyen added. — Hakyung Kim The Dow Jones Industrial Average would actually be higher on Monday if it weren't for losses in Nvidia, which is single-handledly taking the market lower on concern that China is suddenly racing ahead in the contest to master artificial intelligence. Nvidia at its low fell $21.81 to $120.80, equal to more than 134 points off the Dow, which Nvidia only joined in early November. Every $1 move up or down in any stock in the Dow, which is calculated based on companies' individual share prices rather than their total market value, raises or lowers the average by 6.15 points. — Scott Schnipper Apple became the most valuable publicly traded company once again on Monday, after Nvidia's rout sent its market value plummeting. Microsoft also surpassed the chipmaker, landing in the number two spot. Shares of Nvidia tumbled 13.5% on concerns over possible competition from Chinese startup DeepSeek, which claims it launched a free, open-source language model at a fraction of the cost of its competitors. Apple's market cap currently sits near $3.4 billion, while Microsoft is at $3.2 billion. Nvidia's market cap is just shy of $3.1 billion. Just last week, Nvidia had reclaimed the top spot, replacing Apple as the most valuable company. — Michelle Fox, Nick Wells Nvidia is on track to notch its largest daily decline in nearly half of a decade as Chinese startup DeepSeek's large language model catalyzed a global tech sell-off. Shares of the artificial intelligence darling slid more than 13% in morning trading. If that holds, Monday would mark Nvidia's worst day since March 2020, when the stock tumbled 18.5% in a session. With Monday's decline, Nvidia is now down more than 5% in 2025. The DeepSeek developments also weighed on other AI plays, as well as stocks tied to the buildout of power providers to support this technology. Tech stocks in international markets also felt the heat on Monday. — Alex Harring The CBOE Market Volatility Index, known on Wall Street as the VIX, soared more than 45% early Monday to 21.56 — up from just 14.85 on Friday, according to FactSet data. The VIX briefly rose as high as 22.51 on Monday. The VIX is a measure of how much investors expect the S&P 500 will move over the next 30 days and is often considered a byword for how much fear there is in the stock market and where current sentiment stands. The 52-week high of 38.57 in the VIX came during August's risk-off unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades when the Bank of Japan raised rates, the dollar weakened and it briefly looked as though U.S. unemployment was picking up. — Scott Schnipper Stocks were lower across the board to kick off the new trading week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 200 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 shed 1.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 3.4%. — Lisa Kailai Han These are the stocks moving the most in premarket trading: Nvidia — The artificial intelligence darling saw shares tumbling more than 11% in premarket trading, on track for its worst day since March 2020. The sell-off occurred after Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a free open-source large-language model, saying it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million. Microsoft, Amazon — Other megacap stocks also sold off sharply after the news of DeepSeek stoked questions about the large amounts of money Big Tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers. Shares of Microsoft shed 5%, while Amazon dropped by more than 4% and Meta Platforms slid by 2.5%. Constellation Energy, Vistra — Power providers for AI infrastructure were also hit hard on concerns that there would be less energy needed if DeepSeek can perform using fewer chips. Constellation Energy, Vistra, Nuscale Power and Oklo all slid at least 10% in premarket trading. Read the full list of stocks moving here. — Yun Li, Lisa Kailai Han More than 80% of stocks in the Nasdaq 100 retreated in Monday's premarket, underscoring the technology rout tied to Chinese startup DeepSeek and artificial intelligence. With all those members sliding, the tech-focused index fell more than 4%. Marvell Technology led the way down with a drop of more than 12%, while Broadcom, Constellation Energy and Nvidia each tumbled more than 11%. AI-related names sold off before the bell as concerns mounted around the potential for a stock bubble. This was catalyzed by the strong performance from DeepSeek's open-source AI model, which has raised questions about the amount of investment needed in the technology. — Alex Harring The tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to open sharply lower on Monday, but a fund tracking Chinese tech names is looking at a rally. The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) rose about 1% in premarket trading, building on a 3.7% gain from Friday. The top holdings in the fund include Tencent, Alibaba and Trip.com. There doesn't appear to be any direct link between major Chinese tech stocks and the new DeepSeek AI model. The move could be partly a catch-up trade, as KWEB has been a long-term underperformer of U.S. tech funds. — Jesse Pound Travel + Leisure Co. will be a winner as travel demand accelerates, according to Bank of America. The firm double-upgraded its rating on shares of the membership and leisure travel company to buy from underperform. It also hiked its price target to $60 per share from $40. A more resilient leisure travel backdrop in 2025, as well as a lower rate environment, will benefit Travel + Leisure, according to analyst Dany Asad. "We now think TNL is best positioned to deliver peer-leading double-digit EPS growth in 2025. TNL's inventory spend is limited, putting free cash flow conversion ahead of peers and enabling aggressive stock buy backs," Asad wrote in a Monday note. — Hakyung Kim Nvidia shares dropped 11% to lead a major tech sell-off after Chinese startup DeepSeek raised concerns over the U.S.' competitiveness in AI. Fellow chipmakers Micron and AMD lost 8.6% and 5.5%, respectively. Megacap tech names Amazon and Meta fell about 5% each, while Microsoft pulled back by 6%. — Fred Imbert, Jenni Reid Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index was 0.69% lower at 8:30 a.m. London time, with Germany's DAX index falling 1.2%. Technology was the worst-performing sector, down 4%, as artificial intelligence firms retreated around the world on concerns over competition from China's DeepSeek. Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory deVere Group, said DeepSeek's newly launched AI model had been reported to be more cost-effective while running on less advanced chips than tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. "Deepseek is going to challenge Silicon Valley's leadership, disrupting the global tech landscape and reshaping the direction of the AI arms race," Green said in emailed comments. "The launch of this innovation underscores a historic pivot in the balance of technological power." — Jenni Reid Roughly 90 S&P 500 companies are due to post their latest quarterly figures.

Title: Playing To Win: The Pros And Cons Of Workplace Competition
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2025/01/26/workplace-competition-pros-cons/
Time Published: 2025-01-26T21:30:00Z
Full Content:
Workplace competition has pros and cons. Workplace competition is inevitable in a corporate environment with an inherent pressure to outperform peers. Whether vying for promotions or bonuses, employees are in a constant race to climb the corporate ladder. Many organizations foster a competitive spirit in the hopes of driving productivity and innovation. When encouraged in the proper way, workplace competition can be beneficial. Yet, that same tactic can backfire if unhealthy rivalries result in a negative or hostile work environment. Competition in the office is more widespread than most people think. In a survey by ResumeLab, over 80% of respondents admit to experiencing workplace competition. While the majority (69.6%) describe the competition with co-workers as being healthy, just over 30% feel the competition is toxic. Co-workers who are considered healthy competition are referred to as “positive rivals.” The research revealed that employees with a positive rival are twice as likely than those with a negative rival to believe their organization creates an environment of healthy competition. Whether workplace competition results in a positive or negative experience depends on how leaders motivate employees. When competition makes employees feel excited, it can induce creative behaviors. On the other hand, if it causes workers to feel anxious and fearful, it could lead to unethical actions. Let’s review the pros and cons of workplace competition and how to create a balanced culture that generates positive outcomes. Fostering healthy workplace competition can boost employee engagement. For example, creating fun contests can help keep workers motivated. When your team feels inspired, they will work harder and be more productive. Competition also encourages people to learn new skills and go outside the scope of their roles. They feel challenged, which often contributes to greater performance. When that happens, it’s also easier for managers to identify individuals who display the leadership and initiative to be considered for promotions. Encouraging a competitive environment at work can drive creativity and team innovation. When the pressure to outperform peers builds, workers are motivated to think outside the box and strive for excellence. In a competitive workplace, the desire to innovate is constant. As a result, pursuing fresh ideas often leads to breakthroughs that might not occur in a strictly collaborative setting. Companies like Google, Amazon and Tesla are examples of organizations where workplace competition has been known to drive transformation and increase efficiency. When managed properly, workplace competition can generate higher-quality work output. The competitive environment helps guide employees to drive toward a goal. Their desire to outperform co-workers increases their focus and motivates them to pursue excellence. As teams put in more effort to impress their managers, work quality increases. If workplace competition is focused on negative outcomes, like the threat of layoffs or being publicly humiliated, it can create a toxic environment. Depending on the individual, the stress and anxiety associated with excessive competition can also breed hostility and negatively impact mental health. Finally, intense competitiveness can erode team unity as employees focus more on individual success than what will benefit the organization as a whole. When competitiveness at work results in a distrustful environment, collaboration is discouraged. Another downside is that some team members might perceive the competition as unfair, which can bring about conflicts. New employees, in particular, may feel discouraged if they think the expectations are unreasonable. When team members distrust leadership, it can result in disengagement over time. Depending on the individual, a highly competitive work environment can cause some people to act dishonestly. For example, if a sales executive is feeling the pressure to reach virtually impossible targets, they might sabotage a colleague’s work or manipulate data. When workplace competition becomes too intense, employees might even take credit for other people’s work to achieve a better performance review. Ultimately, these negative behaviors damage the company’s long-term reputation and team morale. Workplace competition can be a double-edged sword. While it sometimes motivates employees, it can also have the opposite effect. According to a study published in Harvard Business Review, the determining factor is how employees respond emotionally. If they interpret their feelings as anxiety, they are more likely to behave unethically. Yet, when they feel excited, they are apt to leverage creative behaviors to problem-solve. Fundamentally, how workplace competition makes people feel plays a crucial role in how they try to succeed. By leading with a positive attitude, managers can maintain a competitive spirit that makes employees feel nurtured and valued. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Dublin’s new bus routes: How will your service be affected?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/dublin/2025/01/26/dublins-new-bus-routes-how-will-your-service-be-affected/
Time Published: 2025-01-26T20:30:22Z
Full Content:
A total of 13 new bus services have launched across Dublin and its surrounding areas as part of the latest phase of the National Transport Authority’s BusConnects redesign. The new lines, which began operating on Sunday and include two 24-hour north-south routes, serve communities between Dublin Airport, north Dublin, the city centre, south Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and north Wicklow. Overall bus service levels in all these areas are set to increase by 7 per cent, according to the NTA. The new spine E1 and E2 routes, which run around the clock, bring to 12 the number of 24-hour bus services in Dublin’s bus network. The two new routes also provide access to third-level colleges, including UCD, TCD, DCU and TUD, and hospitals like the Mater, the Rotunda, Temple Street and Loughlinstown. The E1 bus will depart from Northwood in Santry, taking passengers via DCU and the city centre before heading out the N11 to complete its journey at Ballywaltrim in Bray. [ How are you affected by new services replacing 46A and others?

The new 19 radial route, which runs from Dublin Airport, through Drumcondra and on to the centre of Dublin, offers direct connections from areas including Glasnevin and Ballymun to the airport for the first time. The 19 will initially terminate in Parnell Square, with three weekday morning peak services running to Merrion Square and three weekday evening peak services running from Merrion Square. Additional services to and from Merrion Square will be introduced from February 4th and services will run daylong to and from Merrion Square from April. The latest phase of BusConnects also includes the introduction of eight new local routes. Two new express (X) routes have also launched in this latest phase. The X1 runs from Kilcoole via Greystones to Hawkins Street in the city centre, while the X2 runs from Newcastle via Kilcoole, Greystones, Brides Glen before also terminating on Hawkins Street. The new services replace the following lines which have now ceased to operate: 46a, 46e, 63, 63a, 84, 84a, 84x, 143, 144, 145, 155, 184 and 185. Most customers of the famous 46A bus route, which ceased operations on Saturday after 99 years’ service, will turn to the new E2 service for transport through the capital city. However, none of the new lines directly replaces previous services but they offer a more “connected, accessible and reliable public transport system” which ensures more “choice and flexibility”, the NTA said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for High Returns in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. On December 17, 2024, J.P. Morgan released its market outlook 2025. The report expects the global economy to continue growing at a robust rate, however a sharp slowdown in China is expected. Regarding the equity market, the firm anticipates depressing trends across stocks, sectors, and themes. Analysts at the firm estimate the S&P 500 to be around 6,500 in 2025 with earnings per share of $270. The head of Global Market Research, Hussain Malik noted that the policies of the United States regarding trade, immigration, and regulatory policy will play a critical role in defining the year’s outcome for the country and globally. The report further elaborated on its anticipation of a depressed stock market by highlighting de-coupling central bank policies, uneven progress in disinflation, and ongoing technological innovation. Moreover, increased geopolitical tensions are also likely to add unusual complexity to the global stock market. Despite all this, the firm has bright expectations for the United States. It believes that the country will remain a key driver of growth due to factors such as an expanding business cycle, a robust labor market, increased capital spending related to AI, and active capital markets. On the other hand, Europe is expected to grapple with structural challenges, while emerging markets may face headwinds from persistent high interest rates, a strong US dollar, and trade policy issues. Lakos-Bujas, head of Global Markets Strategy at J.P. Morgan warned that a key risk to their base case involves disinflation stalling or reversing, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate hikes later in 2025 or early 2026. Such developments would necessitate a reassessment of their market outlook. To curate the list of the 10 best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025, we used Insider Monkey’s third-quarter hedge funds database. We checked the 25 most widely held stocks by hedge funds for 10-year growth rates from Seeking Alpha and ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. 10-Year Revenue Growth: 21.88% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 121 Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) runs an online streaming platform where users can watch movies, and TV shows, play games, and avail of other streaming services. The company has been gaining subscribers due to engaging content on its platform. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) executed its commitment to accelerating growth. It grew its revenue by 16% year-over-year while expanding its profit margins by six points to 27%. Management noted that it added 19 million net additions to its subscribers, which is the biggest net additions during a quarter in its history. On January 24, Laurent Yoon, an analyst at Bernstein, upgraded the stock to Outperform from Market Perform. The analyst also raised the price target from $975 to $1,200 stating that the firm believes Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) can post another year of double-digit growth in 2025. The analyst believes that there are still many international markets that remain underpenetrated by the company. Management has also raised its revenue expectation by $500 million for 2025 indicating they can generate more revenue from its memberships. It is one of the best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. Montaka Global Investments stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “There are multiple structural trends in the enterprise software space, including (i) the ongoing cloud migrations and digital transformations of enterprises, and (ii) the infusion of AI into software applications. Overall, NFLX ranks 7th on our list of best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

These five sectors offer substantial opportunities for investors looking to align with innovation ... [+] and market demand. The investment landscape in 2025 offers several promising opportunities in high-growth sectors. While market volatility continues to be a challenge, certain areas stand out for their strong growth potential, technological innovation, and ability to address critical global issues. This analysis, supported by comprehensive market research and economic indicators, highlights five sectors worth investors' attention. Successful investing in specific sectors requires analyzing several factors that indicate sustainable growth potential. These criteria are essential for making informed investment decisions based on solid fundamentals rather than market sentiment. Market trends involve both cyclical patterns and long-term changes in the economy. Key factors include trading volumes, price movements and sector rotation patterns. Economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates are vital in understanding market movements. For instance, the U.S. economy grew by 2.1% in 2024, but inflation rates stabilized around 3.4%, affecting sectors differently. Shifts in global trade dynamics, such as increased trade agreements in Asia and the continued impact of supply chain disruptions, are shaping investment opportunities. Innovation remains a critical driver of growth. Metrics such as R&D spending, patent applications, and the pace of new product development highlight sectors leading in technological advancements. According to recent reports, global R&D spending reached $2.5 trillion in 2024, with industries like artificial intelligence and clean energy receiving a significant share of this investment. Companies that innovate consistently are better positioned for sustained growth and market leadership. Analyzing global demand patterns helps identify growth trajectories. Demographic trends, such as aging populations in developed markets and growing middle classes in emerging markets, shape consumption patterns. For example, India’s GDP growth is projected to exceed 6.3% in 2025, driven by increased domestic consumption and infrastructure spending. These factors create opportunities for sectors like healthcare, advanced manufacturing and clean energy. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations are now central to evaluating sector performance. Sectors aligned with sustainability goals often benefit from supportive regulations and growing consumer demand for responsible business practices. In 2024, global ESG-focused assets under management surpassed $40 trillion, demonstrating the increasing investor focus on sustainability metrics such as carbon footprints, resource efficiency and governance standards. The sectors identified here were selected using a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. Financial indicators such as revenue growth, profit margins and return on invested capital (ROIC) were paired with assessments of market positioning, competitive dynamics and regulatory environments. As we head into 2025, identifying the right sectors to invest in is more important than ever. With shifting economic trends, emerging technologies and evolving consumer habits, certain industries are positioned to outperform others. In this section, we’ll explore five sectors that offer strong potential for growth and resilience in the year ahead, backed by market trends and data-driven insights. Whether you’re looking for stability or high-growth opportunities, these sectors deserve a closer look The Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) sector is growing rapidly, with applications spreading across healthcare, finance and logistics industries. Major players are consolidating their market positions through acquisitions of innovative startups. AI adoption is accelerating, supported by technological advancements and increased investment. According to PwC, AI-driven technologies will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Regulatory frameworks are also evolving to ensure ethical AI usage, further boosting the sector's credibility. Clean energy has transitioned from an alternative option to a mainstream necessity. Advancements in battery technology and storage solutions have addressed previous challenges in adopting renewable energy. Governments worldwide are committing to net-zero emissions targets. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 continues to funnel billions into clean energy projects, and declining costs of renewable installations make this sector highly attractive. The healthcare technology sector encompasses digital health platforms, advanced diagnostics, and personalized medicine. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital health solutions while biotechnology continues to innovate. An aging population and rising healthcare costs are driving demand for innovative solutions. According to the WHO, global healthcare spending reached $10.3 trillion in 2024, highlighting the importance of this sector. As cyber threats grow in complexity, the cybersecurity sector is evolving rapidly. Comprehensive security platforms now incorporate AI-driven tools, zero-trust architectures and cloud-native solutions. Regulatory requirements, such as GDPR in Europe and increased focus on data privacy in the U.S., drive demand for robust cybersecurity solutions. Gartner predicts that worldwide spending on cybersecurity will exceed $200 billion by 2025. Technologies like industrial robotics, 3-D printing, and smart factories are revolutionizing traditional manufacturing processes. Supply chain disruptions in recent years have accelerated the adoption of automated solutions. Rising labor costs and the need for supply chain resilience have made automation a priority. According to McKinsey, automation could add $1.2 trillion to the global economy by 2030. These five sectors offer substantial opportunities for investors looking to align with innovation and market demand. While the potential for high returns exists, diversification and risk management are critical to navigating market volatility. Before investing, assess company fundamentals, valuation metrics, and broader economic conditions. Staying informed and monitoring trends within these sectors will be key to long-term success in 2025.

Title: Tesla's future under President Trump: Weigh AI potential against slowing EV demand

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla’s (TSLA) eye-watering post-election rally may soon resume. The stock, which has rocketed a staggering 65% since Nov. 5, has taken a breather in recent weeks, as worry over slowing demand trends and a rollback of pro-EV policies raised fears of near-term financial performance. Tesla shares fell 4% during President Trump’s first week back in office, contributing to a one-month decline of 12%. Despite the recent dip, many analysts remain confident in the company heading into its critical fourth quarter earnings report. Rather than focusing on Tesla’s first annual sales decline in over a decade, they’re becoming increasingly optimistic about Tesla’s AI potential. Analysts at Piper Sandler and Wedbush were among the teams raising their 12-month price targets this week, with Piper Sandler naming Tesla its top "buy-and-hold idea" and Wedbush calling the new administration a "total game changer" for the company. Watch: GM's CEO Marry Barra on the company's EV plans “The $7,500 credit rollback is more of a negative for new entrants and Detroit’s big three automakers,” Ives told me on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief. “For Tesla, 90% of what's going to drive the stock is autonomous and AI … that's the ultimate story.” Ives predicts Tesla’s valuation will reach $2 trillion by the end of this year, driven by what he described as a “regulatory friendly” White House that will “fast-track the autonomous future.” Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas also sees AI as a key growth driver for Tesla. In a recent note to investors, the Tesla bull wrote that AI and robotics have become top of mind for clients following Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang’s CES presentation. The AI chip juggernaut announced a partnership with Toyota (TM) for autonomous vehicles and another deal with automotive company Continental and self-driving truck firm Aurora. However, Jonas has not yet priced embodied AI into his value modeling for Tesla. “We are receiving more incoming client requests to discuss humanoids than the entirety of our auto OEM, dealer and supplier coverage combined … While we continue to view Tesla as sort of an embodied AI ‘ETF’ and well positioned due to the underpinnings of our DREAMS framework, we note that we do not currently ascribe any value to Tesla for embodied AI in our $430 price target or $800 bull case,” Jonas wrote in a note to clients. Jonas also sees the Trump administration’s tariff policies as a potential catalyst for the company. He views Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs as a push to accelerate onshoring of AI-enabled technology, a move that could create future growth opportunities for Tesla. “We expect to see the Trump Administration’s EV and AV policies encouraging new domestic supply of critical technologies and supporting manufacturing and supply base,” Jonas wrote. “In our view, Tesla's role in helping to 'fill the void' of next-gen manufacturing and supply chain will be an increasingly consequential driver of growth and shareholder value.” And it’s the AI narrative that sets Tesla apart from the rest of the automakers. Traditional automakers, for comparison, are facing a different reality as President Trump’s threat of tariffs on Mexico and Canada weigh on stock performance. Shares of General Motors (GM) have climbed just 6% post-election, while Ford (F) and Stellantis (STLA) have declined 1% and 2%, respectively. According to RBC analysis, General Motors is most exposed to looming tariffs, given that Mexico production accounts for about 35% of US sales, followed by Stellantis and Ford. As the debate over whether Tesla can meet Wall Street’s lofty expectations under President Trump continues, the company is set to face its first major test this week. Tesla is scheduled to release fourth quarter results on Wednesday after the market close. Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Smith on X @SeanaNSmith.

Send an email to Rob. President Donald Trump appointed Andrew Puzder ambassador to the European Union this past week. But before he heads to Brussels, Puzder is warning about the left-wing scourge of stakeholder capitalism. As the former chief executive of CKE Restaurants, a major fast food corporation operating Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, Puzder knows what it takes to run a successful business. That’s why he’s so alarmed at the trends he’s witnessing in corporate America. Puzder spoke to The Daily Signal about his new book, “A Tyranny for the Good of its Victims: The Ugly Truth about Stakeholder Capitalism.” “Why would family-friendly brands like Disney or Target or a brand like Anheuser-Busch that’s trying to appeal to beer-drinking guys … advance the transgender agenda?” Puzder said. “It just doesn’t make any sense. Or why would ExxonMobil and Chevron adopt net-zero carbon emissions policies when the product that justifies their existence, their most profitable product, is gas and oil?” “It’s because there really is a group of financial elites, people who run these large asset management firms who are trying to impose this leftist, radical, woke cultural agenda on America—on us.” Puzder pointed to three firms in particular: “BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—and add them together, they are the largest shareholder in about 80% of the companies in the S&P 500.” He explained, “This is a very powerful voting block, which really can direct how these companies go and indirectly how our economy goes, and by proxy, all of us. That affects everybody.” Even though the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) agenda appears to be in retreat, Puzder warned that consumers still need to be on guard. He pointed to activist Robby Starbuck’s recent success as an example of how Americans could fight back. “The Left certainly is very good at patronizing companies that support their values,” Puzder said. “On the Right, we need to be just as good or better, and sometimes that’ll cause a little pain, but I think we need to let these companies know what we think.” In the interview, we also cover: Purchase your copy of “A Tyranny for the Good of Its Victims.” Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences.

Title: Crypto narratives: How the absence of earnings fuels investor fervor

AI synergy with blockchain fuels new trading opportunities in the crypto landscape. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post from Shane Neagle, Editor In Chief from The Tokenist. Not all narratives are created equal. In the age of digital financial platforms, investing in all kinds of assets has never been easier. This is happening at a time when the stakes are both clear and high. In order to outpace the erosion of money due to central banking, otherwise known as inflation, investing has to yield sustained high single-digit returns at a bare minimum. But in a rush to outpace inflation, in addition to offset capital gains tax, investing has become akin to gambling. This is especially apparent in the blockchain space. To become more resilient when staking an asset, what should investors keep in mind? Lowering the barrier to entry works both ways in the crypto world, but not so much in the stock world. On one hand, people have easier access to capital, but on the other hand, companies face increased scrutiny and regulatory burden by going public. This is evident by the stocks drop off since the mid-1990s, having fallen by 56% by 2020 from over 8,000 stocks. Because publicly traded companies are based on physical operations that exert expenditures and require quarterly financial reports, there is a cycle of inflows and drop offs.This leaves the number of stocks at approximately the same level, reliant on business cycles. In other words, stocks have an inherent barrier to entry, from the side of businesses, which also serves as a signal for value. The same is not the case for digital assets. Notwithstanding cryptocurrencies based on the proof-of-work algorithm like Bitcoin, the vast majority of crypto coins are based on proof-of-stake consensus. This means there is no longer a requirement for infrastructure in the form of mining hardware and electricity. In turn, there is no crypto equivalent when it comes to expenditures and earnings. Likewise, funded and generalized proof-of-stake platforms like Ethereum, BSC, Solana or Avalanche serve as a launching pad for easy token creation. These factors are driving the number of cryptocurrencies to ever increasing heights, greatly overshadowing the number of stocks at 16,218 (at press time). All of these coins compete for a finite amount of capital and human attention, which means the more tokens are birthed the greater the dilution effect. Not only is it easy to create cryptocurrencies ex nihilo, but it is also easier to access them via self-custodial wallets and decentralized exchanges. At first glance, this may seem beneficial, but does it benefit people’s portfolios? Among countless examples in the negative direction is the recent Hawk Tuah (HAWKTUAH) coin, having dropped by 99.14% in value since its inception in July. In the absence of quarterly earnings, and boosted by ease of entry, crypto traders have become reliant on “vibes”, or narratives: The exact same principle exists in the lottery. Because it is known that some people won lottery tickets, the potential for life-changing gains is established, regardless how remote it actually is. This is why the memecoin narrative has been so performant over the last year, as a market cap-weighted category. Of course, that “performance” accounts for the flood of memecoins that increased the market cap and opened up new narrative gambling opportunities. In actuality, most traders lose money based on such narratives. According to Pump.fun at Dune Analytics, 60% of memecoiners lost their narrative bets. A REMINDER THAT: • 60% of all memecoin traders lost money trading memecoins. • 4.7% made no money. • 24% made less than $100. • 11.2% made more than $100. • 3% made more than $1,000. • 0.5% made more than $10,000. • People who have made more than $10K can barely… pic.twitter.com/ADakThjOcX — Kermit 🐸 (@crypto__kermit) November 19, 2024 Although it is easy to see how memecoin trading is a simulacrum of gambling, these digital assets are traded equally with other coins. This includes Bitcoin with its fixed scarcity and vast computing infrastructure to anchor it into the physical world. Consequently, it is fair to say that some crypto narratives have a draining effect on the wider crypto market. After all, those capital inflows could have been better served elsewhere. But where exactly (excluding Bitcoin as the obvious candidate)? Just like the AI boom endowed Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) with over $3 trillion market cap, the AI narrative has become dominant in the crypto space, even outpacing memecoins. Notwithstanding the buzzwordiness, what exactly does AI + blockchain bring to the crypto table? It turns out, these technologies are perfectly complementary. Blockchain represents trustless networks, which are prerequisites for autonomous AI agents to operate without centralized oversight. For instance, AI agents could be used to automate tasks such as managing portfolios or yields on DeFi platforms. In other words, they have the potential to turn digital assets into passive income streams. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) makes it possible to create and co-own AI agents, which will then interact with a wide range of blockchain networks. This potential already skyrocketed VIRTUAL token, having gained over 5,000% value in the last three months. Similarly, ai16z (AI16Z), inspired by entrepreneur Marc Andreessen who co-founded venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), is the first AI-governed Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Serving as a utility token, AI16Z pays for activities within this virtual fund to automatically trade tokens on DeFi platforms, post social media content or browse the web to glean insight. Over the last month, AI16Z gained 90% of value. Another notable project is NeuralAI (NEURAL), as a part of a wider ecosystem in which AI agents generate 3D objects from text descriptions. Although down 30% over the month, NEURAL token gained 911% value over the last year. Likewise, Morphware (XMW) gained 291% value in the same period. This project aims to decentralize computing power needed for AI infrastructure, with XMW monetizing GPU hardware across a peer-to-peer network. With 83% of companies stating AI is their top priority, many are already thinking about how blockchain fits in this new world order. If AI already has the capacity to generate coherent text based on input sentiment, it is not far off in analyzing market sentiment as well. In turn, machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), could end up systematizing complex derivatives trading such as futures contracts by leveraging technical indicators and social media content. In fact, such AI agents could be more adept at trading volatile memecoins as they churn out social media narratives 24/7. Namely, they could pick just the right time frame to enter and exit the market. Of course, this would end up in an agent-vs-agent trading landscape. However, just like in a traditional arms race, such an environment could amplify the value of AI agent-centric tokens, in addition to their supporting infrastructure. And just as lottery spectacles aren’t going away due to their potential, memecoins are likely to stay as well. But with emerging AI projects focused on trading, at least memecoins could work off their capital drain. Since 2015, Shane fervently backs decentralized finance, penning countless articles on digital securities and the fusion of traditional finance with DLT.

can also claim free 100W 2m USB-C cable by adding both items from the How to claim Free benefit gift area in green under the price. Warning: I clicked through once and the green text link disappeared when I refreshed/went back to the item page. so be careful seems to be limited to click once per account. even after clearing cookies and refreshing Free gift page link is gone for me. all time low for this small capacity power bank. cheaper than the recent $19 Anko 10000mAh (which tbf had built in cables but only did 15W). and $1.20 more than the cheapest $12.74 INIU 10000mAh (but tbf the LIMETA goes 18W single port and 36W dual port compared to INIU’s 15W). this cheaper LIMETA page looks identical to the other listing, but this one has been on sale from November 2022 making it 2 year 2 month old stock compared to 1 year 3 month old stock of the $20 one which has been posted before (you can claim free cable on this one too). fyi guys because this is older stock of the same model: I might have missed it but could not find any marketing mentioning the 80% charge limit by app function that’s on the $20 one. (possible only when charging power bank at 18W with one port). the exact same looking $20 LIMETA is also known to use high quality Samsung batteries inside, I don’t know if it is true of this older stock $13 one. (regular power banks won’t use Samsung batteries anyway, but some people like hearing that) also do not plug two chargers into any power bank. this is a feature unique to this LIMETA power bank. This one has the ability to limit charging to 80%, I am currently using the ISD Link app. Can't seem to find an official Limeta app on android. ISDT and Limeta are the same company or closely related. I used apkpure to download the Android version of the app. thanks. 👍 sounds like you have the $13 one and you tested so 80% charge limit works on it. Nice - that is cheap - I paid the full original price (nearly $30) over a year ago - it's been a great powerbank Yep got the cable for free nice. yeah weird for me even logged out I can’t see the Benefit link under the price anymore. I had the Benefit page in my browser history before so I could have technically still got it. but worth knowing you can lose the link easily. Ok found it. $13 model is PB40 $20 is EB40 Not sure whats the differences are but $13 model also shows EB40 in many areas. $20 page says Model No. EB40, Part No. PB40. so my conclusion was same model, just old stock or V1 version? a lot of the function also the exact same. https://www.isdt.co/pb40.html?lang=en I think juat different brand. Not sure.. but im not savvy enough to break open the $13 later lol Sold out Oh c…crap! That was quick Tried adding it to my cart and it was no longer available. Uses samsung 21700 cells, does pass through charging, has 2 independent 18w circuits. I have it hooked up to my laptop and app shows one circuit is charging the power bank at 18w and the other is charging the laptop at 22w (even when it claims 18w is max). Do not try to charge the powerbank using 2 cables from the same power brick for e.g 2x cables from a single 65W PD brick, the power bank did make some weird noises, use 2 separate power bricks and it will be fine. Does get a little hot but there is an option within the app to reduce the heat through decreasing charge/discharge strength. Got the Apple Watch charger version. It’s also on sale but with lower capacity. Also has the bonus cable. 7000mAh one right? haven't seen that one before. but I also don't have a AW. I wonder if it can charge both phone and watch at the same time if you put the phone face down->powerbank->AW on top. Here to look for fire comments… I prefer models that come with included cables, and they are slimmer. I bought one on sale for $10 a year ago. I prefer models that come with included cables you mean built in cables? yeah they can be handy especially if travelling you don't have to constantly wonder where the cable is. Yes! Get a small pouch, put cable and power bank on it. yeah but sometimes you will separate the two. maybe you are at someone elses place and they already have a charger, so you take out and just use the cable. maybe you just plug it into car, plane or cafe USB-C port. maybe you are in a rush and only have time to shove it in your bag where it gets buried under everything else. it's worse for clumsy forgetful people like me so I would be happy to know the cable can't come off the power bank. I don't plan on travelling any time soon so I don't need one yet but I thought built in cable would be handy when you really depend on the power bank to charge. @n3ck3ntry8bort0rgasm: Mine arrived, it says eb40 on the box. So tiny!!! @CyberMurning: yeah so I think my comment above checks out, it is the same model as $20 one, just older production/version stock. as you also said “$20 model is EB40”. $20 one still in stock guys. link at bottom of deal post.

“Dad was very affectionate and, unlike many men of his generation, there would be public displays of affection…hugs and kisses on the street” Patrick Cole with his late dad Paddy Paddy with some of his grandchildren Paddy Cole and his wife Helen Cole Paddy with ‘Big Tom’ MacBride Paddy in action playing his saxaphone Paddy never let his illness stop him enjoying life. Seen here with his granddaughter Jamie When showband legend Paddy Cole’s funeral takes place tomorrow in his native Co. Monaghan it will be “a proud ‘Blaney man coming home,” his son Pat said yesterday. Father-of-three Paddy Cole, who turned 85 in December, died last Wednesday afternoon in Dublin’s St Vincent’s Private Hospital following a three-year battle with incurable lung cancer. Paddy’s son, Pat, yesterday shared memories of his famous father, who was one of the best-loved entertainers in Ireland, revealing how he revelled in family life. “Dad was very affectionate and, unlike many men of his generation, there would be public displays of affection…hugs and kisses on the street,” Pat told the Sunday World. Paddy with some of his grandchildren “I’m living in Dublin and my siblings, Pearse and Karen, are abroad, and every Saturday my son, Patrick, myself and Dad – three generations of Patrick Coles – would meet up together for coffee. “And that was a ritual that was protected. Family was very important to him. He has a clatter of sisters up in Castleblayney that he has always stayed close to. So he has kind of been the big brother there. “Then there are the grandchildren…we have four, my brother has two and my sister has three, so plenty of grandchildren. When the kids were smaller he was a nightmare because he’d come to the house with pockets full of sweets and wind them up to high doh. They’d be bouncing off the walls and he’d go, ‘Right, I’m away…’ Paddy Cole and his wife Helen Cole “He loved them dearly and was immensely proud of them. My daughter, Ruby, plays the flute and used to play with Dad in the church in Beechwood (Ranelagh) on Christmas Eve every year, with Julian Vignoles and Ciaran Tourish. He’d get all the kids up on the altar and rattle out a few tunes. The number of people who told me in the last few days that that was a highlight for them... “Ruby is going to sing a piece at Dad’s funeral. The grandchildren are all cut up, but they also feel grateful and lucky that they got to spend a lot of time with him. For people who lose grandparents early you don’t have the sense of who they were. They are constantly surprised when the pictures from his time in Vegas bubble up and they see him with the likes of Muhammad Ali and movie stars.” What was it like growing up with a famous father? Pat says: “Everyone knew him and when we were out with him as kids we would say it was better to have two of us with him because you knew you weren’t going to get to talk to him, you’d have people coming up to him saying, ‘I used to dance to you in Buncrana,’ or ‘I was dancing to you in the Sixties, do you remember me?’ “But he loved all those interactions. He invariably did make some connection with them…’that was a draughty hall’ or ‘the fella that ran that ballroom was a torture to get paid’…and they’d all laugh about whoever that fella was. “He kind of traded on positive energy and he would have gotten energy back from all of those interactions as well. So both the people that came up to him and Dad got a buzz and a bounce out of all of those connections. Paddy never let his illness stop him enjoying life. Seen here with his granddaughter Jamie “Dad wouldn’t want to get into any gossip or negative kind of chat. There was nothing to be gained from that. And even when he got the cancer diagnosis in 2022, that was a real setback, but he had a positive outlook…here’s what I can control and I’m going to keep going forward. “He did like the Clint Eastwood philosophy of “don’t let the old man in.” So it was stay active, stay busy, be useful. He was flying for a full 85 years. “We were in the hospice in Blackrock and they said to him, ‘oh, you had a birthday recently, 85,’ And he said “yeah, a number I only ever thought I’d see above a door.” “He had a positive ritual of getting out, getting his walk, getting the paper, meeting loads of friends for coffee, people like (comedian) Noel V Ginnity and (singer and promoter) George Hunter. He had different gangs he would meet. Paddy in action playing his saxaphone “There were old pals he’d meet on a Saturday morning and then he’d meet me after that. And I’d ask him, ‘Any new stories?’ He’d say, ‘Sure there’s never any new stories. Sure it’s just a group of deaf fellas waiting their turn to tell their story.’” Pat, who has a brother, Pearse, and sister, Karen – all are in their 50s – tells how their mother and father were united to the end and nothing was left unsaid. “It was kind of beautiful when I was bringing Mum out to the hospital to see the two of them together…and it was poignant, of course,” he says. “This time next month they would have been 60 years married. Mum is doing pretty well, as well as can be expected. When some time ago Mum had a fall and suffered broken bones the running joke in the house was, ‘Dad, sorry, you’re the terminal cancer patient, but you’re not patient number one in the house at this point.’ “He was then looking after Mum and that probably kept him going as well on a level.” Was he accepting of his terminal cancer diagnosis? “Yeah, there was nothing left undone, himself and Mum had had all the conversations. They had a rich life together,” Pat says. “It wasn’t the type of lung cancer that smokers get. It was the lining of the lung wall. The first doctor who diagnosed it asked, ‘did you work with asbestos all your life?’ Dad couldn’t figure that out, he thought it might have been how the dance halls were constructed back then. “But he got three years and maybe that was his lung capacity from blowing the sax all his life. He kept going and with his humorous take he used to say, ‘People are telling me I’m a miracle man. Sure that’s no good to me, they’re telling me, basically, that I should be dead already.’” Paddy with ‘Big Tom’ MacBride Pat told how his father was very proud of being honoured with a two-storey mural in his native Castleblaney in 2019. “Himself and Big Tom got the freedom of the town,” he says. “It’s great that Castleblaney honoured Dad when he was alive, so we had that big event and then the mural went up on the wall in Lakeview opposite where Dad grew up, where my granny used to live. “On Monday we’ll do a pause at the mural before we move to the church. It’s a proud ‘Blaney man coming home. “I don’t think Dad was an enigma to people. The bubbly, effervescent, high-energy, high-octave guy that people met on the street is exactly who he was. So he ran at that speed. “We thought he had limitless energy, we thought he’d go forever. I think he gave it a good run for the three years, so he wasn’t going gently into that good night.” Paddy Cole’s remains will be reposing at Fanagans Funeral Home, Rathfarnham, Dublin, today from 2pm to 5pm.

Title: 6 Top Stocks To Buy Now For February 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-26T12:00:00Z

Will big tech continue to dominate in 2025, or will value stocks and underdogs shine bright? If your New Year's resolutions include increasing your net worth, you may need to review and revise your investment portfolio. You can use these expert-recommended top stocks for February 2025 to kickstart your research and get motivated for the wealth opportunities ahead. These top stock recommendations came from interviews with nine investing experts: The experts cited several factors that will shape the financial markets in 2025. Improving U.S. economics and potentially lower interest rates alongside high valuations and the threat of lingering inflation are stoking optimism and caution. And, despite President Trump's vow to boost U.S. oil and gas production, several experts also identified the clean energy transition and sustainability as key themes. Notably, the experts were divided on the influence of technology and AI in the year ahead. Shen, Kravetz, and Bennett believe strong AI demand will continue to lead the financial markets. Chashchin and Stanzione shared different views. Chashcin says market leadership could shift away from AI and big tech this year. "We've been seeing tech dominate for so long, but 2025 might be the year when other sectors, like financials, start to take center stage," he explains. Stanzione sees room for overlooked tech stocks, specifically Intel (INTC), to outperform. In short, uncertainty prevails. Reflecting a dynamic environment ahead, the list of top stocks below includes big tech plays, solid value stocks and a downtrodden underdog. The table below includes six best stocks for 2025 to buy now, according to experts. Let's review each of these stocks now. Apple makes smartphones, wearables, laptops and desktop computers. The company also operates the App Store, earning commissions on sales made by app publishers. Apple's stock price is down double digits in January after reports of soft device sales in China. However, Brown characterizes the downturn as a buying opportunity rather than a sign of permanent weakness. "The real play is Apple Intelligence," Brown explains. Apple Intelligence is Apple's suite of AI tools, available only on newer iPhones, tablets and computers. Those include the iPhone 16 and tablets and MacBooks with M1 or later chips. As Apple Intelligence features get more sophisticated, upgrades to Apple's AI-compatible devices should increase. Nvidia is a fabless semiconductor company, meaning it outsources chip manufacturing. The company's high-powered GPUs are the preferred AI computing chips. Nvidia sells GPUs and related products to original equipment and device makers, cloud computing providers, software vendors and internet providers. Shen and Bennett are bullish on AI. Bennett explains, "The growing integration of AI across industries is reshaping business models, boosting productivity and driving demand for automation." He expects the AI revolution to deliver sweeping gains in productivity and efficiency in technology, health care and manufacturing. Nvidia has been a primary beneficiary of that revolution. Between early 2023 and early 2025, NVDA stock grew more than 800%—driven primarily by AI demand. While the growth pace may moderate, Shen believes Nvidia's dominance and upside will continue. He cites the company's strategic collaborations and strong market positions in AI, machine learning, data centers and autonomous driving. Tesla makes and sells electric vehicles. The company also produces and sells solar energy generation and storage solutions for residential, commercial and industrial applications. Munoz sees growth potential for Tesla this year, despite the EV-maker's ongoing fight for market share in China. Positive factors for the company and shareholders include: Tesla should also benefit from "federal oversight of autonomous vehicle regulation," Munoz explains. On the other hand, the Trump administration may soon cancel the federal tax credit for EVs. This will be a short-term negative for Tesla. But Munoz believes it will hurt Tesla's competitors more and ultimately "solidify Tesla's leadership in EV sales." Berkshire Hathaway is a diversified conglomerate with subsidiaries in insurance, retail, packaged foods and transportation. The business portfolio includes Geico auto insurance, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom Companies, Pilot Travel Centers and International Dairy Queen. The company's chairman and CEO Warren Buffett is among the world's most successful and respected value investors. Materazzi likes the prospects for Berkshire Hathaway in early 2025 and beyond. He cites the conglomerate's portfolio of successful brands and businesses, which provides ETF-like diversification. "The company really remains undervalued despite concerns about its generational leadership transition," Materazzi explains. "Investors do not seem to give this stock the same attention as other high-profile names," he continues. Berkshire Hathaway's Vice Chairman Charlie Munger passed away in 2023. Buffett will celebrate his 95th birthday in 2025. Berkshire Hathaway is the 10th largest S&P 500 stock, measured by market capitalization. Intel designs, manufactures and sells CPUs, GPUs and related hardware for memory, storage, connectivity and networking. Intel holds a dominant market share in CPUs globally, though it faces competition from AMD in desktop computers and servers. Intel isn't an obvious choice. The chipmaker was barely profitable in 2023, lost 60% of its value in 2024 and was recently removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Still, Stanzione believes Intel could have a big year in 2025—better than its current price point would suggest. Intel delivered an adjusted loss per share of $0.46 in the third quarter as the company worked to reduce costs and simplify its portfolio. CFO David Zinsner said the cost management initiatives would support improved profitability. This positivity was reflected in the fourth-quarter adjusted EPS guidance of $0.12. Intel will publish its fourth-quarter results on January 30. Reddit runs a website of interest-based communities with volunteer moderators. The company sells online advertising and subscription-based memberships. It also licenses its data for training generative AI applications. Reddit went public in 2024 at $47 per share. Less than a year later, RDDT trades for $184. Kacaba says the numbers "make Reddit a stock worth watching, but it's the strategy behind those gains that tells the bigger story." Reddit's allocation of IPO shares to loyal users has been pivotal to the company's success. "Reddit created alignment between its brand and its community, ensuring that those who helped build the platform could also share in its financial upside," Kacaba explains. Kacaba also highlights the business advantages of Reddit's deep community focus. The platform encourages intense user engagement and discussion. Both elements can be monetized, respectively, through advertising and AI-related licensing. Will big tech continue to dominate in 2025, or will value stocks and underdogs shine bright? Since no one knows the answer, you might consider preparing your portfolio to withstand either outcome. Diversification trims some growth potential but also limits your risk. In uncertain times, accepting that trade-off can be your best option. For more 2025 investing ideas, see best dividend stocks and best ETFs.

Title: Earnings Season Gets Real As The Magnificent 7 Begins Reporting
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/26/earnings-season-gets-real-as-the-magnificent-7-begins-reporting/
Time Published: 2025-01-26T12:00:00Z

Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Tesla (TSLA) are scheduled to report on Wednesday after ... [+] the close, with Apple (AAPL) on Thursday night. The forward earnings guidance and any implications for artificial intelligence spending will be watched closely. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Within the S&P 500, 36 companies reported earnings last week, with a sizable number being financials. Eighty percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. This week marks the second busiest of the fourth-quarter earnings season, with 104 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. And most crucially, four of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Supportive earnings and stable bond yields sent stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 1.8% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 1.5%. Market Returns The financial sector again contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, Travelers (TRV) and Discover Financial Services (DFS) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 49.4% from 47.5%. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by technology and communications services. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost thirty-one percent decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal gross domestic product growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% has met expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimated Sales By Sector Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for banks and other financial companies, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.7% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season and this week. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Tesla (TSLA) are scheduled to report on Wednesday after the close, with Apple (AAPL) on Thursday night. The forward earnings guidance and any implications for artificial intelligence spending will be watched closely. This week, there are releases across the sectors, which will provide a better sense of the overall earnings environment. Beyond the Magnificent 7, other companies reporting are Starbucks (SBUX), Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). Magnificent 7: Q4 Estimated Year-Over-Year Earnings Growth In addition to earnings, there are many economic releases and a Federal Reserve meeting. Notably, fourth-quarter U.S. GDP, a measure of economic growth, will be released on Thursday. The economy is likely to continue to show above-average growth and entered 2025 with good momentum. Consensus estimates for fourth-quarter GDP growth are 2.7%, with the Atlanta Fed projecting almost 3% growth. U.S. Fourth-Quarter U.S. GDP Growth Estimate The Fed meets on Wednesday before the GDP release but is armed with enough data to make the result of the gathering a foregone conclusion. The combination of resilient economic growth and above-target inflation should result in no change to short-term interest rates. While the conclusion is almost certain, Chair Jerome Powell’s comments will be watched closely for clues as to the timing of future rate cuts. Currently, expectations are for a total of two 0.25% reductions in 2025, with the first cut not likely until near midyear. Expected 2025 Fed Rate Cuts Financial companies provided an excellent start to earnings season, but this week will be crucial with more broad representation and the majority of the Magnificent 7 on the calendar. Because the Magnificent 7 companies are responsible for significant earnings growth, their forward guidance should significantly impact overall expectations. The Fed is almost sure to make no changes to short-term interest rates, but Chair Powell’s statement will impact expectations around the pace and timing of future cuts and, thus, markets.

Title: Value dining deals around Dublin to lift those January blues

Yes. It’s still going on. Never-ending January continues, as we await the first post-Christmas pay cheque and the days to lengthen gradually into brightness. Restaurants across the city know that we particularly appreciate a bargain around now, and they equally want our custom at this quieter time.

Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster says Meta Platform Inc.’s META plans to invest up to $65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure will benefit Nvidia Corp. NVDA and other hardware players. What Happened: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday outlined the company’s capital spending plans for 2025 and its focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Don’t Miss: Zuckerberg expects Meta to allocate between $60 billion and $65 billion for capital spending, primarily aimed at expanding the company's AI teams and building a new data center. he described the new data center as being “so large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.” The tech mogul further noted that Meta aims to bring a gigawatt of computing power online by 2025 and is projected to finish the year with over 1.3 million graphics processing units. Weighing in on the announcement, Munster said Meta’s commitment “exceeds Street estimates of $51B.” "In 2025, I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts," Zuckerberg said.

In December, Meta introduced the Llama 3.3 70B, a new AI model that outperforms competitors like Alphabet Inc.‘s GOOGL GOOG Google, OpenAI, and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN. This model offers the performance of Meta's largest Llama model, Llama 3.1 405B, but at a reduced cost. Last year in April, Meta announced its plan to purchase 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by 2024 to fuel its AI initiatives. Zuckerberg then said the 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs were initially intended to enhance Instagram Reels, not to position Meta as a leader in AI technology. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump criticized the European Union (EU) for focusing on U.S. tech giants like Meta, Apple, and Google. He accused EU regulators of unfairly targeting these companies, calling their actions “a form of taxation.” Price Action: Meta Platform’s stock closed at $647.49 on Friday, down 0.20% for the day, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Title: ‘It was glamorous, and we thought it would last forever’ – curtain falls on Paddy Cole, king of the swingers

From hanging with Elvis to dodging Roy Rogers’ calls, the seasoned saxophonist’s life was simply epic Showband legend Paddy Cole Helen and Paddy Cole Paddy Cole and Butch Moore Butch Moore and the Capitol, with Paddy Cole in the back row Paddy Cole with former Sunday Independent editor Aengus Fanning. Photo: Julien Behal In April 2022, before the funeral of Dickie Rock’s wife Judy in Rathfarnham, Paddy Cole told me he had just been diagnosed with incurable lung cancer. He battled it with bravery and courage for the best part of three years, succumbing last week at the age of 85. Cole was a legend in the Irish entertainment industry and one of the country’s most respected musicians. His professional career playing Dixieland jazz began at the age of 12 in Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, and lasted until his cancer diagnosis. He also gave rise to one of the great anecdotes in Irish showbusiness, first told by Kevin Marron in the Sunday World. While doing a residency in Las Vegas, members of his band, the Big 8 showband, became friendly with their boyhood hero, Roy Rogers — a famous TV cowboy with a horse called Trigger. One night, Rogers had gone to their gig, and was so taken with the band that he invited them to his ranch. In time, the friendship became slightly irksome for the Irish band — and Marron was in Paddy’s apartment for dinner when the phone rang. As his wife Helen went to answer it, Paddy shouted: “If that’s Roy Rogers, tell him I’m not in.” The anecdote gave rise to the title of a biography of Cole by journalist Tim Ryan. Paddy was a very decent man with an easy charm and ready smile, who formed friendships all over the world, from celebrities and VIPs to ordinary folk who admired him for his expertise on the saxophone and clarinet and his genuine love of life and music. He also engaged in many charitable enterprises and was voluntary chairman of the royalty-collection agency Recorded Artists, Actors and Performers (RAAP), as well as presenting a well-received weekly radio programme on Sunshine FM. In an RTÉ recording of Open House, singer Joe Dolan summed him up: “I’ve never heard Paddy say anything rude about anybody or talk behind anyone’s back… he’s just one of those lovely people that come around once in a lifetime.” He’s just one of those lovely people that come around once in a lifetime Paddy Cole was born into a musical family in Henry Street, Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, on December 17, 1939, the second in a family of seven children. His father, also Paddy, worked for the post office and played saxophone with the local Regal Dance Band and later the Maurice Lynch Orchestra. “I often think back about my dad and I admire him a lot for working day and night,” he said in his autobiography, King of the Swingers, written with Tom Gilmore. “He was with the post office, driving a mail van, delivering letters and parcels to sub-post offices every morning, as well as being a musician by night.” Butch Moore and the Capitol, with Paddy Cole in the back row His mother, Mary Hughes, also from a musical family in Castleblayney, was the mainstay of the family and encouraged her son from an early age. Listening to old 78rpm records on the gramophone, he became a fan of New Orleans jazz – something that would last his lifetime and make him a handsome living. Billed as “12-year-old Paddy Cole, Ireland’s youngest saxophone player”, he played his first professional gig with his father in Maurice Lynch’s band, just on the cusp of what became known as the showband era. While still at vocational school in Castleblayney, he rushed from classes to the band’s van waiting outside the school gates, collecting him for gigs. “We were doing a cross-section of everything — a variety of music to suit all tastes,” he said, from Bill Haley’s Rock Around The Clock to Irish ballads and Glenn Miller dance tunes. But there was also pressure on him to get a steady job, in case the music didn’t work out. He worked as a petrol-pump attendant, an apprentice electrician and a butcher. But the music of Count Basie, Duke Ellington and others held him in thrall. With the advent of the showband boom and the money that it brought to rural Ireland, there was a demand for good musicians. Two young agriculture students, Eamonn Monaghan and Des Kelly, had formed the Capitol Showband, and in 1961 they came calling on Cole, with an offer of £30 a week. Paddy shrugged off obscurity to play all over the country in parish halls and the new ballrooms that were springing up. “It was glamorous, and we were enjoying it all, even if we weren’t that conscious of how good the music was. We thought it would go on forever,” he said. His first gig with the Capitol was at the Pavilion Ballroom in Blackrock, Co Louth. “It was so hectic in those early days with the Capitol that there wasn’t even time to think,” he said. There were concerts all over Ireland and Britain, some before crowds of 4,000 people. The band did a programme on Radio Luxembourg, and recorded with Phil Coulter at the Tommy Ellis Studio in Dublin, and did publicity work for newspapers and magazines. Their big break came when Belfast-born promoter Phil Solomon brought the band to London to record Sunday Night at the London Palladium, a huge televised variety show with an audience of millions. Solomon, who also recorded Van Morrison and The Dubliners, wanted the Capitol to be the show’s house band — and was miffed when they turned it down. They were also the first Irish showband to go to the US, in 1961, at a time when there was no music or dancing during the Catholic season of Lent in De Valera’s Ireland. The band had three number one hits in 1964-65 with Down Came the Rain, Born to Be with You and Walking the Streets in the Rain, which had been Ireland’s entry in the Eurovision Song Contest, sung by Butch Moore. Helen and Paddy Cole While playing a dance in Newcastle West, Paddy met a “fabulous-looking girl” – who a week or two later, he spotted walking along Westmoreland Street in Dublin. She was Helen Hehir. The couple married in February 1965, but had to cut their honeymoon in Marbella short when Paddy got a call to get over to London to record for The Eamonn Andrews Show and Thank Your Lucky Stars. When Butch Moore got an offer “he couldn’t refuse” and left the Capitol, the showband scene was coming to an end. Paddy Cole got a phone call to see if he would join the Big 8 with Brendan Bowyer and Tom Dunphy. The Big 8 spent six months of the year doing a Las Vegas residency at the Stardust. “It was hard work,” he told Tom Gilmore for King of the Swingers. “We were doing three shows a night, six nights a week and each show was an hour long.” But there was time off too, and Paddy recalled meeting Elvis Presley and attending Frank Sinatra’s legendary concerts in Caesars Palace. Although they loved the lifestyle and climate of Nevada, the Coles returned to Ireland in 1974 and Paddy decided to leave the Big 8 — announcing it through the pages of the Evening Press, much to the annoyance of band leaders Brendan Bowyer and Tom Dunphy, and of manager TJ Byrne. Cole, who had been teetotal in the early years, started “drinking a few bottles of Guinness” after shows, which became more than a few bottles as time wore on. He admitted to Gilmore that he was at this stage “a bad drinker”, ending up after gigs drinking late into the night with people he didn’t know, asking himself the following morning why he was doing it. After he had some nodules removed from his throat, he was told by his surgeon not to drink alcohol for five weeks — and he never did. “It was no big deal,” he once told me, “I never went to AA meetings or anything like that. But to be honest, it was then I realised that people attending my gigs were buying me so many pints… "While it was my policy never to drink before going on stage, I felt at the jazz gigs that I had to have a pint from time to time. But I never drank after that cancer scare, and it changed my life.” After stints with the Paddy Cole Band and the Paddy Cole Superstars, he bought a pub in Castleblayney, named it Paddy Cole’s Place — and moved home. Due to back trouble he had to stop performing, and was eventually “sacked” from his own band and given a sinecure working in the office. He credited the singer Twink with “bushwhacking” him into cabaret and after that he became a staple on the scene, playing with her on stage and television shows. Reunion tours with the Capitol, The Showband Show and cabaret gigs at Clontarf Castle, the Braemor Rooms, the Harcourt Hotel plus gigs all over the country, kept him busy as a musician for the rest of his life. After selling the pub, the Coles moved to a Victorian home in Ballsbridge, Dublin. Like many musicians he suffered from financial insecurity, which led in 2006 to him making a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners for €834,726 in relation to off-shore bank accounts — probably the one embarrassing blot on his long career in showbusiness. Paddy Cole with former Sunday Independent editor Aengus Fanning. Photo: Julien Behal While not playing music, Cole was a keen golfer and member of the prestigious Lahinch Golf Club in Co Clare. “I cringe when I hear that word ‘retirement’,” he told one interviewer. “I want to ease back a bit and pick and choose where and when I’ll play. But there’s an old saying: ‘You don’t stop because you get old; but you get old because you stop’ — and that’s why I won’t be stopping.” He put it another way to an old showbusiness acquaintance. “When you have somebody offering you €5,000 for a couple of hours’ work doing something you really love, you’d be stone mad to say no.” Sadly, when he was diagnosed with lung cancer, he had to stop. One of his great regrets was no longer being able to play sax or clarinet. But he faced his illness with his usual grace, joking from his hospital bed that there was so much fluid on his lungs that “I need a plumber, not a surgeon.” One of his favourite haunts was Gleesons pub in Booterstown, Co Dublin, where he would meet with friends for coffee, particularly Éanna Casey who worked with him in the musician’s royalty organisations RAAP. Among his many lifelong pals were musician Eamonn Monaghan and comedian Noel V Ginnity and a host of others, including businessman Mick Sherry who drove him to and from hospital appointments. Paddy Cole, who died last Wednesday, is survived by his wife Helen and children Karen, Paddy and Pierce. His funeral mass takes place in Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, at 12 noon tomorrow.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg's $65 Billion AI Bet Benefits Nvidia And Other Players, Says Top Analyst, But Warns Market Bull Run Will 'End In A Spectacular Bubble Burst'

Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster says Meta Platform Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) plans to invest up to $65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure will benefit Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other hardware players. What Happened: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday outlined the company’s capital spending plans for 2025 and its focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Don’t Miss: Elon Musk Told The U.N. If They Could Show A Plan For Ending World Hunger He'd Donate $6 Billion – ‘I Will Sell Tesla Stock Right Now And Do It' Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Zuckerberg expects Meta to allocate between $60 billion and $65 billion for capital spending, primarily aimed at expanding the company's AI teams and building a new data center. he described the new data center as being “so large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.” The tech mogul further noted that Meta aims to bring a gigawatt of computing power online by 2025 and is projected to finish the year with over 1.3 million graphics processing units. Weighing in on the announcement, Munster said Meta’s commitment “exceeds Street estimates of $51B.” "In 2025, I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts," Zuckerberg said.

In the long term, the higher capital expenditure (Capex) is expected to accelerate the AI flywheel, leading to more innovation, lower usage costs, an increase in customers, and consequently, more investment. He also issued a reminder, stating, “I believe the market is going higher and the run will end in a spectacular bubble burst.” Why It Matters: Zuckerberg’s announcement comes on the heels of Meta’s recent AI advancements. In December, Meta introduced the Llama 3.3 70B, a new AI model that outperforms competitors like Alphabet Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, OpenAI, and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). This model offers the performance of Meta's largest Llama model, Llama 3.1 405B, but at a reduced cost. Last year in April, Meta announced its plan to purchase 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by 2024 to fuel its AI initiatives. Zuckerberg then said the 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs were initially intended to enhance Instagram Reels, not to position Meta as a leader in AI technology. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump criticized the European Union (EU) for focusing on U.S. tech giants like Meta, Apple, and Google. He accused EU regulators of unfairly targeting these companies, calling their actions “a form of taxation.” Price Action: Meta Platform’s stock closed at $647.49 on Friday, down 0.20% for the day, according to Benzinga Pro data.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other stocks. Even though the year 2024 was not kind to certain sectors within the US economy, the broader outlook for the stock market heading into the new year was more than rosy. Investment banks generally anticipated moderate economic growth for the US in 2025. For example, Deutsche Bank forecasts a growth rate of approximately 2%, noting that 2025 will not be a year of rapid GDP growth. Meanwhile, JP Morgan's Global Investment Strategy team emphasized a foundation of strength stemming from 2024's robust market returns. They highlighted themes such as easing global policies and rising capital investment as key drivers for the coming year. Their report, Outlook 2025: Building on Strength, suggested that the US economy was well-positioned to capitalize on these favorable conditions. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, inflation remained a focal point in economic discussions. Top economic experts project that inflation rates will decelerate in 2025, approaching the Federal Reserve's 2% target by the second half of the year. This outlook suggests a stabilization of price levels, which could influence monetary policy decisions. US Bank Chief Economist Beth Ann Bovino offered insights into the Federal Reserve's anticipated actions. She predicted that the Fed would implement two interest rate cuts in 2025, citing continued economic strength. Bovino also noted that proposed tariffs and tax cuts by the new administration could exert additional inflationary pressures, potentially complicating the Fed's policy decisions. The fiscal policies of the new administration are expected to play a significant role in shaping the economic landscape. Bank of America analysts Claudio Irigoyen and Aditya Bhave discussed the interplay between US policy changes and the global economy. They anticipated that fiscal policy would be expansionary through tax cuts and acknowledged that proposed tariff increases could have a modest impact on consumer price inflation. Their analysis underscored the importance of balancing growth initiatives with inflation control. In terms of sector performance, Standard Chartered Bank expressed optimism about equities and commodities. Entering 2025, the bank was overweight in equities and gold, citing a resilient global economy with a projected GDP growth of 3%.

To make our list of the best stocks in falling markets, we first made a list of stocks that have lost 15% or more over the past 12 months and are in the telecommunications, technology, or software infrastructure industries. Then, we picked the stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q3 2024 courtesy of Insider Monkey’s database of hedge funds.

A team of engineers and scientists collaborating at a workstation surrounded by their applications and solutions. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 123 Decline in Share Price Over Past 12 Months: 27.6% Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) operates as a diversified software company worldwide. There are several compelling factors that make this company a strong investment. Firstly, the company’s robust financial performance and its ability to grow revenue and deliver solid profitability are reflected in the report for the fourth quarter of 2024. For instance, Adobe achieved revenue of $21.51 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth in constant currency. Diluted earnings per share was $12.36 on a GAAP basis and $18.42 on a non-GAAP basis. Secondly, the company has teamed up with artist and culinary author Benny Blanco to create a collection of customizable marketing templates for Adobe Express, the company’s powerful yet user-friendly design app. This collaboration aims to empower small businesses, including restaurants, to easily create eye-catching content that stands out both online and in person. Moreover, the company has launched Adobe GenStudio, which would drive customer engagement, personalization and conversion. Overall ADBE ranks 1st on our list of the stocks to buy in falling markets now.

Title: BlackRock Ethereum Holdings Surpass 1.2 Million ETH Amidst Strong Institutional Adoption – Details

Ethereum (ETH) declined by 5.68% in the last week in line with the majority of the crypto market. The prominent altcoin currently trades around $3,290 as investors await the crypto bull run’s return to form. On the other hand, rising institutional adoption provides a positive development for the Ethereum community. According to a recent X post by Burak Kesmeci, Ethereum is currently experiencing a surge in institutional adoption as evidenced by developments in the Spot ETF Market. Kesmeci highlights that BlackRock’s ETHA accounts for the majority of this demand with net assets of 1.2009 ETH valued at over $3.19 billion. According to data from SoSoValue, this record is largely unsurprising as ETHA has experienced the highest net cumulative inflows of $3.97 billion in the Ethereum Spot ETF market. Fidelity’s FETH occupies second place with 432,750 ETH valued at around $1.46 billion. Bitwise’s ETHW and VanEck’s ETHV follow with holdings of 105,974 ETH and 45,766 ETH, respectively. Meanwhile, all other Ethereum Spot ETFs except the Grayscale ETHE have accumulated at least 7,000 ETH since their launch in July 2024. A rise in institutional demand of Ethereum as Indicated by the data above indicates strong confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. While Ethereum Spot ETFs may not replicate the performance of Bitcoin counterparts, the institutional demand these funds command could enhance ETH market stability and liquidity, paving the way for broader regulatory acceptance and mainstream adoption. In other news, bearish sentiments currently prove dominant in the ETH market as dominated by a higher proportion of short-term transactions to long transactions. According to Kesmeci, short orders represent 57% of all Ethereum futures trades indicating that the majority of traders are betting the altcoin to experience a further price decline. This negative development is particularly observed on the Bitmex and Bitfinex exchanges. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,297 after 0.17% loss in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume has dipped by 24.24% and is now valued at $25.36 billion. Based on its daily trading chart, Ethereum appears to be consolidating despite recent losses. With any price rally, the altcoin could reach around $3,700, moving past which would spur a return to around $4,000. On the other hand, another fall in Ethereum’s price could result in a slump to around $3,100, which lies its next significant support level. With a market cap of $396.85 billion, ETH retains its position as the largest altcoin and second-largest cryptocurrency in the world.

Title: BlackRock Files To Change Its Bitcoin ETF To Allow For In-Kind Redemptions — Good News For BTC?
URL: https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-files-to-change-its-bitcoin-etf-to-allow-for-in-kind-redemptions-good-news-for-btc/
Time Published: 2025-01-25T20:38:15Z

Asset management giant BlackRock is pushing for a significant update to its spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, to allow in-kind redemptions rather than just for cash. Authorized participants, aka large institutional investors, would be able to buy and redeem shares of the ETF directly in Bitcoin. This model is deemed more efficient as it lets authorized participants closely observe the demand for the fund and act swiftly by buying or selling shares of the ETF without being obliged to sell the BTC through a market maker and deliver cash. Initially, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT with cash-only redemption, but this proposed update reflects a move toward bigger integration of Bitcoin in institutional ETF operations. “It should have been approved in the first place, but Gensler/Crenshaw didn’t want to allow it for a whole host of reasons they gave,” Bloomberg’s ETF analyst James Seyffart observed on X. “Mainly [they] didn’t want brokers touching actual Bitcoin.” According to a Jan. 24 amended rule filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Nasdaq proposed “to allow for in-kind transfers of the Trust’s Bitcoin.” This in-kind model is more efficient for ETFs as it avoids bid spreads and broker commissions from selling the basket to raise cash for issuing shares. Notably, retail investors won’t have access to the in-kind redemption model as they will only be eligible to participate in the cash model. Only authorized participants willl be able to do in-kind redemptions and creations. “The main point is that the in-kind model is way more streamlined with less steps and less parties involved (and its how the vast majority of ETFs operate),” Seyffart explained. BlackRock now holds an astounding $60 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) in its iShares Bitcoin Trust, an impressive feat reached just one year after going live on Wall Street. This represents about 2.7% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. BlackRock’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin has positioned it among the biggest institutional holders of the premier cryptocurrency, even usurping MicroStrategy’s well-known cache. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also recently sparked excitement among market participants after speculating a BTC price target of as high as $700,000 if more institutions adopt it. He has been talking with sovereign wealth funds about allocating 2% to 5% of their assets to Bitcoin, which indicates that even entities that usually avoid risk are becoming interested amid President Donald Trump’s return to the White House for his second term.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 2025. Stocks have been performing well lately as they seem to have been influenced by the excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) as well as the new administration. CNBC reported that stocks rose on January 22, with the S&P 500 hitting a new all-time high, as technology stocks rallied on AI optimism and President Trump’s new term in office. On Wednesday, January 22, stocks finished higher as all 3 of the major indexes ended the session in the green. The S&P 500 increased by 0.61% after reaching an intraday record of 6,100.81 before closing at 6,086.37. The Nasdaq Composite excelled and rose 1.28% to reach 20,009.34, underscoring the outperformance of tech stocks.

President Trump also recently announced a joint venture named “Stargate,” involving OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank, to invest at least $500 billion in AI infrastructure within the US. Stocks rose because of solid earnings reports and investors continued to pile into the AI space following this recent announcement by the new administration. Keith Lerner, Truist’s co-chief investment officer, pointed out that a combination of a resilient economy, easing inflation, stabilizing of interest rates, and a strong start to the earnings season has created a favorable environment for the market. He noted that AI and technology continue to be key drivers of this bull market. Another key factor playing a role in this market rally is the optimism around Trump’s agenda. Investors are hoping that Trump will ease regulations and reduce corporate taxes, which could lead to an increase in profits. To compile our list of the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 2025, we used the Finviz stock screener to look for stocks that analysts believe will gain more than 30% in the next 12 months.

The company has several programs in diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and Alzheimer’s disease that are expected to yield results in the next 3-4 years.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Shares of semiconductor giant Broadcom (AVGO) have almost doubled over the past year. Follow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return. Join thousands of data-driven investors – Build your Smart Portfolio for personalized insights. I last wrote about Broadcom in December 2024, when the stock was trading at $162 per share, with the stock currently 50% higher since then. The past year was great for long-term bulls, but investors who had their eye on the stock without pulling the trigger may be feeling some sententious FOMO (the fear of missing out) right about now. Fret not; yield-seeking, dividend-loving, capital-gains-hunting tech-savvy portfolio holders. Despite its monumental one-year run, it’s not too late to invest in Broadcom. I’m bullish on the company despite the upward re-rating, based on its history of generating exceptional long-term returns, the massive growth potential of the AI chip market, and its compelling track record as a strong dividend growth stock, all of which make it an appealing opportunity for long-term investors. The primary reason why it’s not too late to invest in Broadcom after its big year is because its recent metrics are nothing new for the stock — Broadcom is a long-term performer, not a flash in the pan. In fact, over the past decade, Broadcom has generated a stellar total return of 2,850% for investors, far exceeding broader benchmarks. While it has been a good decade for equity investors, the S&P 500 (SPX), as represented by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), has generated a total return of 256% over the same period, meaning that Broadcom generated ~10x the return of the broader market. An investor who put $10,000 into Broadcom 10 years ago would have an investment worth $280,500 today, while an investor who put $10,000 into VOO would have an investment worth $25,584 today. Even when looking at the more tech-centric Nasdaq 100 (NDAQ), Broadcom has outperformed. The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) has generated a strong 456% total return over the past decade, but this strong performance still pales in comparison to Broadcom’s stellar return. Winners tend to win for a reason, and they tend to keep winning over time, which gives me confidence that it’s not too late for investors to add Broadcom to their long-term portfolio. While the law of large numbers means Broadcom’s returns are unlikely to match those of the previous decade in the years ahead, the stock is well-positioned to deliver strong results (and returns) for its shareholders. Broadcom’s spectacular performance over the years has somewhat overshadowed the fact that it is also an outstanding dividend stock, ranking in the top three in a recent TipRanks’ Best Dividend Stocks comparison. While shares yield just 1%, below the 1.3% average yield for the S&P 500, the company has a solid record of growing its dividend payout. Broadcom has paid dividends to shareholders for 14 consecutive years and has increased its nominal payout yearly. Moreover, the semiconductor maker has grown its dividend at an impressive 14% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. The company also maintains a conservative dividend payout ratio of under 50%, so there is ample room to increase the dividend as earnings increase. While today’s 1% yield may look underwhelming, this penchant for dividend growth means that long-term shareholders will likely enjoy a superior yield-on-cost as the company continues to grow its dividend payout over the long term. Broadcom is a major player in AI chips, and while this market has garnered more hype than substance so far, there is strong reason to expect growth in this sprawling sector in the years ahead. Precedence Research estimates that the size of the AI chip market totaled $73 billion in 2024 and expects it to grow at a remarkable 29% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next decade, reaching $928 billion by 2034. Obviously, a lot can happen between now and 2034, so these numbers are best taken with a few grains of salt, but they illustrate the scale of the likely market for AI chips in the long term. Broadcom predicts that the company can haul in $60-90 billion in sales of its custom AI chips in 2027, up from an AI revenue base of $12 billion in 2024. Given this massive growth potential, it’s unsurprising that analysts also forecast Broadcom to achieve continued earnings growth in the years ahead. Wall Street analysts expect Broadcom’s EPS to grow 30% to $6.35 per share in 2025 before ramping up a further ~20% to $7.65 in 2026 and reaching $9.10 in 2027. Turning to Wall Street, AVGO has received a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buy, three Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst AVGO stock price target of $237.08 per share implies a 2.15% potential downside from current levels. See more AVGO analyst ratings Broadcom stock has almost doubled in value over the past 12 months, but long-term tech-focused investors who didn’t pull the trigger on AVGO a year or so ago mustn’t develop MOFO or regret missing the boat. The stock is a perennial darling for shareholders with an exemplary history of generating strong cumulative returns for years on end. I remain bullish on Broadcom based on its excellent track record and its compelling history of dividend growth. While the AI chip market has, to some degree, been lifted by market hype, we are still in the early innings of the AI story, which leaves ample potential for the future, especially for investors with a long enough investment horizon to commit to a resilient trend-setter in the early days.

Title: No more number 13 bus to Ballymun as route set to end at Mountjoy Square

Full Content:
Another recognisable Dublin bus route, the number 13 serving Ballymun, will change this weekend, when bus services in the north Dublin suburb are taken over by routes under the Bus Connects network. Route 13 has had a long association with Ballymun and until Saturday of this week ran between Grange Castle in west Dublin and Harristown, close to Dublin Airport. The last bus into each terminus is scheduled for 11.30pm on Saturday night. From Sunday there will still be a route 13 but its northern terminus is to be Mountjoy Square in Dublin’s north inner city. The route will still connect with Grange Castle via O’Connell Street, the south City, Kimmage, Bluebell and Clondalkin. The changes are part of the introduction this Sunday of phase 6a of the National Transport Authority’s Bus Connects network. Under the plan, Route 13 is to continue in name but the northern leg of the route will be dropped. Ballymun will in future be covered by the Bus Connects E-Spine routes E1 and E2 – which are both 24-hour routes. The E1 runs from Northwood, which is north of Ballymun, taking in DCU and the city centre to Ballywaltrim, which is south of Bray, Co Wicklow. The E2 runs from Harristown near Dublin Airport, taking in DCU, the city centre and terminating in Dún Laoghaire. Two other routes, route 4 and route 11, will also survive the changes, albeit with amendments. From Sunday route 4 from Monkstown will be diverted at O’Connell Bridge to Heuston Station. Route 11 from Sandyford will be diverted at Parnell Square to run via Phibsborough and the North Circular Road to the Phoenix Park. Radial route 19 from Dublin Airport via DCU to the city centre will initially operate to and from Parnell Square, and to and from Merrion Square at peak times. An all-day service to and from Merrion Square will commence in April. Routes being replaced from Sunday as part of phase 6a include the 46A, 46E, 63, 63A, 84, 84A, 84x, 143, 144, 145, 155, 184 and 185. [ Goodbye to the 46A: End of legendary Dublin bus route made famous in songOpens in new window ] Kilcoole and Newcastle in Co Wicklow will in future be served by the X1 and X2 routes, respectively. The service will be between North Wicklow and Dublin city centre. In addition a number of short-hop, local services will be introduced around north Co Wicklow and south Co Dublin feeding into local schools, Dart and Luas lines. These include local routes around Delgany, Enniskerry, Greystones and Bray, some routes within Bray and some routes across south Co Dublin. The L26 will link Kilternan to Cornelscourt and on to Blackrock Dart station; while the L27 will link Leopardstown Valley with Cornelscourt and Dún Laoghaire. A full list of the new services is available at transportforireland.ie. Tim O'Brien is an Irish Times journalist © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Investors shouldn't complain, though, after an action-packed start to the week led the coin to hit a new high. The price of the biggest coin by market cap broke a new record of $108,786 Monday ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration. It has since dropped by nearly 4%, CoinGecko shows. And despite President Trump not explicitly declaring plans for a Bitcoin strategic reserve in his first crypto executive order, the coin is still sitting comfortably above the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin soared above $100,000 following Trump's November election; the President promised to slash regulation and help the digital asset industry. And he is keeping his crypto promises—albeit while annoying some hardcore Bitcoiners in the process. Money continued to flow into the crypto investment vehicles this week, after investors threw billions at the funds last week ahead of the inauguration. But it didn't stop, with $802.6 million hitting the funds on Tuesday alone, data from Farside Investors shows. By the end of the week, over $1.75 billion worth of assets had entered the Bitcoin ETFs. The bullishness comes as Donald Trump is expected to be a net positive for the industry. The Republican campaigned on a promise to help the industry and now buying Bitcoin has never been easier thanks to the funds. The spot bitcoin ETFs quietly on fire to start year, with $4.2b in flows which is 6% of all ETF flows. Now at +$40b net since launch with aum at $121b and return of 127%. For context they just passed ESG ETFs in assets ($117b) and have about same as gold spot. pic.twitter.com/GADOomLXD4 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 24, 2025 Bitcoiners had been waiting for it for years. And on Tuesday, President Donald Trump kept his campaign promise to pardon Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. The Bitcoin enthusiast and founder of the dark web e-commerce site—mainly used for buying drugs using Bitcoin—was released shortly after and expressed enormous gratitude to President Trump. The crypto community flooded his digital wallets with BTC donations, too. But Ulbricht—who went to prison in 2013—might already just be sitting on a goldmine: Untouched Bitcoin wallets linked to Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road now hold over $47 million worth of the asset. Ulbricht has long been considered a hero in the Bitcoin community for creating one of the first marketplaces to accept the cryptocurrency. And though it still can't be verified that the wallets do indeed belong to him, it's not beyond the realm of possibility. Ahead of Donald Trump's shock November 5 win, the President had promised plans for a Bitcoin strategic reserve. But after signing his first crypto executive order on Thursday, which touched on the possibility of a crypto stockpile, Bitcoiners noticed one thing—there was no mention of their beloved orange coin, just "digital assets." "The Working Group shall evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts," the order read. The news has angered ardent Bitcoiners, who have been hurling the usual insults about "shitcoinery," and who think it may lead the government to building up a stash of other digital coins. Emergency Press Conference: Ripple is undermining American prosperity, freedom, and Bitcoin. Ripple is actively lobbying to stop a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the U.S. while pushing their centralized, corporate-controlled token. We will not stand for it. pic.twitter.com/EHldJHxyR9 — Jack Mallers (@jackmallers) January 24, 2025 Software company MicroStrategy shareholders are seemingly all-in on the firm's Bitcoin strategy: They on Tuesday voted for a 30x increase to the number of authorized Class A common shares so that the company could have more resources to buy the cryptocurrency. The news came as the company announced its latest Bitcoin buy, bringing its holdings to 461,000 Bitcoin—worth over $48 billion. And on Friday, the firm said that it would redeem over $1 billion worth of its existing debt accumulated early while building up the stash. Elsewhere, British multinational bank Standard Chartered, which has come out with very bullish predictions in the past, said in a Wednesday note that Bitcoin would continue to soar as pension funds enter the space. Analysts at the bank forecasted that institutions enthusiasm for the asset could mean the coin hits $200,000 by the end of 2025. But there were even bigger price predictions for Bitcoin from major players this week. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that growing adoption could push the price of the asset to $700,000, while Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong projected a price in the "multiple millions" at some undetermined point in the future.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Building a great investment portfolio and, therefore, wealth takes a lot of patience and time. Portfolios can also take many shapes depending on the investor’s goals and purpose. For some, it’s all about chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities, which promise quicker returns, while for other investors, it’s about a steadier approach focusing on dividend payments and long-term growth. Both strategies have benefits and again, the right one depends on the investor’s goals, risk appetite and time horizon. Don't Miss: Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. One investor recently shared his journey and explained how he turned $3.50 per hour investments into a $4.4 million portfolio in over 35 years. While his approach relied heavily on dividends and closed-end funds, a major key to his success involved making bold moves on risky stocks like IMMU (Immunomedics) and SAVA (Cassava Sciences). He held IMMU stocks for decades and sold them at the right time, generating $2.2 million for his portfolio, which shows how long-term strategies and perhaps a bit of luck can pay off big. “Started at $3.50 per hour. Went back to school in my early 30s, as did my wife. Definitely no inheritance and student loans to boot. Just 35 years of investing. [...] Got lucky with IMMU buyout after riding that one (in and out) for ~30 years,” the investor said. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Now, he’s planning on shifting gears to more conservative, balanced, high-yield stocks that pay dividends. With his holdings allocated to 150 different stocks, his top 10 favorites make up 25% of his $300K annual dividends. These picks include a combination of dividend-growth stocks, closed-end funds and high-risk plays and he’s shared them in a thread in Reddit’s r/dividends community. Let’s closely examine his top 10 stock picks and why they appeal to so many investors. Investor With $300K in Dividends and a $4.4 Million Portfolio Shares His Top 10 Stocks BSTZ (BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II) BSTZ is a closed-end fund focusing on tech innovation, such as AI, robotics and biotech. With a current dividend yield of 10.04%, this pick is a favorite among investors who want high yields and seek growth and exposure to advanced industries. JRI (Nuveen Real Asset Income and Growth Fund) JRI invests in assets like real estate and infrastructure, offering buyers diversification and a hedge against inflation. With a dividend yield of around 7.89%, JRI charms many investors, especially those close to or already retired and those looking for stability. Trending: It’s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here’s how everyday investors are getting started. DSL (DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund) DSL specializes in global fixed-income securities, such as high-yield bonds and new market debt. Its current dividend yield is 10.17%. Investors buy DSL because of its high dividend rate and diversification across assets. NRO (Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund) Boasting a 10.75% dividend yield, NRO offers access to real estate securities, primarily REITs, which generate returns through property income. KYN (Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund) KYN invests in energy infrastructure acquisitions, including pipelines and storage facilities. With a 9.97% dividend yield, this fund appeals to investors seeking income and exposure to a traditionally high-yielding industry. HIO (Western Asset High Income Opportunity Fund) As a high-yield bond fund created for income generation, HIO offers a dividend gain of 9.50% and appeals to investors due to its substantial profits in fixed-income securities. See Also: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!

MO (Altria Group) MO is a leader in the tobacco sector and offers a 9.91% dividend yield. The group has a strong cash flow, is a reliable dividend stock as per investors and is a good choice for many because it offers diversification into alternative products. ARCC (Ares Capital Corporation) ARCC is a business development company that offers financing to mid-sized companies and offers a dividend yield of 9.91%. Investors who want to benefit from the expansion of private companies find ARCC a good buy. HYT (BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund) With dividend returns of 9.43% currently, HYT invests in a portfolio of corporate high-yield bonds. The fund’s focus on offering regular income and a buffer against market volatility makes it a favorite for many investors. The changing interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.

Title: These 5 Restaurant Stocks Are Coming Off Recent Significant Lows

Restaurant stocks. While hot tech and social media stocks like Amazon and Meta Platforms continue to make new highs, there is one sector failing to keep up: restaurant stocks. Some of these names — like McDonalds — used to be considered must-owns for portfolio managers looking to outperform the averages. Judging by these price charts, those days may be over. Arcos Dorados Holdings (Nasdaq: ARCO): Arcos Dorados Holdings daily price chart, 1 25 25. The price in mid-December dropped below the mid-September support where the red-dotted line is placed. The 50-day moving average in May crossed below the 200-day moving average. The stock briefly rallied off of the late year low but remains below both of those moving averages. Arcos Dorados trades with a price-earnings ratio of 10.57 and at 3 times its book value. The debt-to-equity ratio is 3.35. This year’s earnings are off by 26%. Over the past five years, EPS shows growth of 37%. The company pays a 3.41% dividend. McDonalds (NYSE: MCD): McDonalds daily price chart, 1 25 25. The price in mid-January dipped below the 200-day moving average and has since rallied a bit, although it remains below a down-trending 50-day moving average. That dip down broke below the November low, a previous level of buying support, indicated by the red-dotted line. The company, one of the most recognized brand names in the world, has a market cap of $204 billion. It trades with a price-earnings ratio of 25.

UPDATED 12:11 EST / JANUARY 25 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and Erik Bradley At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we collaborate with Enterprise Technology Research to dig through the latest data and craft 10 predictions for the coming year. This year’s batch follows some annual favorites and new territory. In this Breaking Analysis, we put forth our top 10 predictions for enterprise tech in 2025 with our usual data-heavy opinions and prognostications. Every year we get thousands of inbound predictions from tech companies and thought leaders. We go through each one and we categorize them. The picture below gives you a sense of how many inbound predictions we review. Each year the folder gets larger. Below we show the change in topic areas over the past three years. Remarkably, artificial intelligence, while still prominent, was second this year after cybersecurity. Now in fairness, many of the security predictions involved AI, but it’s notable that generative AI last year propelled AI to the top category with 40% of the inbounds and cyber, which dropped as a percentage of the total last year, has shot back to regain the top spot it held in 2023. As well, cloud and data center grew after last year’s decline and, surprisingly, data continued its downward trend — surprising because there’s not much AI you can do without data. We had several inbound predictions around DevOps but fewer than in past years, and digital transformation, once the buzzword of the day, has all but disappeared from the predictions narrative. Software as a service is still showing some life and, as with cybersecurity, the SaaS inbounds were sprinkled with AI throughout. And the “Other” category remained noticeable with topics around edge, public policy, jobs, social issues and the like. Most of the inbounds were more trends than predictions but there were a few that stood out. Just to give you a taste: The email subject line on predictions from Kevin Cochrane, the chief marketing officer of Vultr Inc., was Vendor Predictions that Don’t Suck. Cochrane predicts the following two items: We’ll see. The hyperscalers are likely to remain fairly walled with massive ecosystems that will allow them to claim openness through choice. And in our view they will get their piece of the sovereign AI pie. Another standout was from Zencoder Chief Executive Andrew Filev, who predicted massive coder productivity increases via agents culminating in the following prediction: And one more from Tarun Desikan of SonicWall Inc., who predicts: We hope this last prediction misses the mark! As a reminder, last week we hosted the “Data Gang” with a number of predictions around data platforms and related topics. OK, let’s move on to this year’s predictions from theCUBE Research and ETR. Above is a glance at all our predictions for this episode on one chart. They span macro tech spending, security, agentic AI, cloud computing, edge, intelligent automation, initial public offerings, data and jobs. We won’t spend too much time on this graphic, but it will give you a quick overview of this year’s menu. Each quarter ETR conducts its TSIS survey with Ns ranging from 1,500 to more than 1,800 on the above chart that measures expectations all the way back to the COVID era. As shown above, we came out of the isolation economy with very high expectations of 7.5% growth and that steadily decelerated as the war in Ukraine and the Fed tightening actions kicked in. We finished 2024 at just around 4%, which was a little lower than we predicted last year, and we enter 2025 with a 5.3% growth expectation from information technology decision makers. The following provides additional context for this prediction: Enterprise IT spending has shown signs of recovery following a period of uncertainty tied to macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. Though headlines warned of an impending recession, technical indicators never confirmed it, and new IT projects are now re-emerging. Our research indicates that overall budgets are on the rise, buoyed in part by a generally business-friendly environment and easing regulatory concerns, though a degree of unpredictability remains. In particular, small and medium-sized businesses are outpacing larger enterprises in spending, and optimism among C-suite executives is running higher than that of front-line practitioners. Bottom line: We believe the data points to a gradual but genuine revival of enterprise IT investment and an underlying tone of positivity given the new administration in the United States. Nonetheless, pockets of uncertainty remain — particularly around inflation, regulatory shifts and geopolitical dynamics. Over the coming quarters, we expect organizations will revise forecasts to reflect evolving market signals. The past three years have shown actuals coming in below expectations although the delta is compressing in what remains an unpredictable macro environment. Our second prediction goes right to the top topic of our inbounds, security. We’re predicting that despite the fact that organizations tell us they struggle to reduce the number of tools in their security stack, the idea of platformization will continue to gain traction in 2025 and become a more prominent theme amongst buyers. Above we show a graph that compares the spending profiles of dozens of security platforms. Net Score or spending momentum is shown on the vertical axis, with Overlap or presence in the data on the horizontal plane. The table inserted in the bottom right informs how the dots are plotted (Net Score by Ns in the survey for each vendor). Note that the graphic is both crowded and there’s lots of green, meaning spending on many vendors’ tool sets continues. Microsoft Corp. stands out in the upper right, and Wiz Inc. is well above the 40% line which we consider highly elevated. Zscaler Inc. and Snyk Ltd. are also above that line The following provides additional context for this prediction: Our research indicates that by 2025, organizations will gravitate toward consolidated cybersecurity platforms, as intensifying threats and mounting complexity make best-of-breed approaches increasingly unsustainable. Nation-state actors now have access to compute at scale and AI capabilities, resulting in continuous, more sophisticated attacks that demand tighter integration and simplified management. Bottom line: We believe that by 2025, the intensity of cybersecurity threats will drive a widespread shift toward consolidated, platform-centric solutions. Although specialized tools will persist where differentiation is critical, the data suggests that simplicity, integration and ease of management will be the guiding principles for CISOs looking to reduce risk and maintain agile, secure environments. Our next prediction focuses on the buzzword of the day: agentic AI. We predict that there will be no “aha moment” foagentic AI in 2025 because security and data privacy concerns will be a headwind. Now, to be clear, we are excited about agentic. We just feel the hype is a bit ahead of reality. There are clear successes taking shape in companies such as Salesforce Inc., ServiceNow Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Workday Inc. Admittedly, there are mixed reviews around Microsoft copilots. Nonetheless, agents are being infused into all SaaS products. We look at agents as the next instantiation of large language models. Rather than prompts from just humans, agents will be pounding LLMs, enabling them to take action based on data context. This will increase the velocity of prompts by orders of magnitude and, as the AI stack evolves, multiple components of the AI stack will need to be secured and managed. Stitching these pieces of the stack together involves risks, creates seams and will be a blocker that needs to be addressed. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We see a growing yet cautious embrace of agentic AI across the enterprise. The positives in the data are that nearly half of surveyed organizations report some level of return on investment, and more than 86% plan to boost AI spending in the coming year. But notable hurdles exist. Specifically, organizations must address security, privacy and intellectual property concerns before AI-based agents achieve broader traction and deliver transformative impact. Bottom line: We believe that enterprise interest in agentic AI is genuine and growing, but organizations will not in 2025 experience a broad-based “aha moment” where these technologies become indispensable and trusted. Addressing security concerns, improving user training and refining real-world applications will be critical factors in driving AI from pockets of success to pervasive, transformative use. Our next prediction relates to the narrative around cloud repatriation. We think that the so-called cloud re-patriots are going to shift their marketing and focus instead on bringing AI to the data on-premises. The data we’re showing above underscores that cloud repatriation is really not a massive trend. Sure, 15% of the customers in this survey are repatriating some workloads, but it’s not an overwhelming revenue generator. A more viable approach in our view is a narrative around bringing AI to the data. And we think that will overtake the repatriation narrative. In a recent CUBE Research survey, we found that 58% of respondents plan to build their AI in their own private data centers. Customers tell us they love Amazon Web Services, they love Bedrock, they love Google LLC’s AI and they’re all Microsoft users. And when we ask why then are you building your own on-prem AI capabilities, they say: 1) That’s where much of our data lives; and 2) The cloud is expensive. And this all will lead to a discussion on edge which we’ll address in our next prediction. The following provides additional context for this prediction: Our research indicates that the trend toward large-scale “cloud repatriation” remains more of a vendor marketing point than a significant market shift. While approximately 15% of organizations report moving some workloads back on-premises, the bulk of enterprise workloads that reside in the cloud will grow in the cloud. Bottom line: We believe that, while certain targeted workloads may move back on-prem for specific business or technical reasons, the cloud continues to dominate infrastructure strategies. The data suggests that repatriation is largely an edge case rather than a widespread reversal of the cloud adoption wave. Our next prediction is around the edge. We see AI inference at the edge showing measurable revenue progress in 2025. Edge computing will be a significant trend in 2025 that will shape and evolve the AI narrative. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We anticipate a surge in edge computing adoption by 2025, driven by the growing need to process data in real time, directly at the source. This trend underpins industries like robotics, manufacturing (Industry 4.0), full self-driving vehicles and retail, all of which demand low latency and rapid decision-making. Our research indicates that edge will not replace or detract from public clouds or on-premises environments. Instead, we expect edge to function as a complementary layer, feeding data to centralized locations for broader analytics and AI training. Bottom line: We believe edge computing will see strong momentum in 2025 as enterprises seek to speed up real-time insights while preserving the ability to leverage the cloud for large-scale analytics. The data suggests that this “cloud plus edge” model offers the best of both worlds: ultra-low latency for time-sensitive operations and centralized infrastructure for advanced AI workloads. Above we show ETR’s XY data format, Net Score by Overlap or penetration in the data set. Microsoft is in the upper right of this chart and will hit close to $200 billion in cloud revenue this year, all in. AWS will surpass $130 billion and Google will come in at about half of that. But as you see on this ETR chart, Salesforce will contribute $50 billion or so. It’s interesting to see CoreWeave Inc. on this. It’s a new name on the survey and it doesn’t appear to be setting the enterprise world on fire. Perhaps this is a case where model trainers rather than enterprises are using its stack at this point. The bar chart insert shows the all-in cloud revenue for infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and SaaS from theCUBE Research over time and is projected to surpass $1 trillion in 2025. The chart below provides additional survey detail and suggests that cloud spending is outpacing overall spending. The following provides additional context for this prediction: Our customer survey research shows cloud spending (IaaS and Paas) growing at nearly double digits — around 9.5% — while SaaS, the second-highest category, lags behind at roughly 4.5%. Despite incremental price increases from cloud providers (averaging around 3%), the insatiable need for compute continues to push organizations to invest more heavily in cloud services. This trend underscores our view that large-scale repatriation remains a limited phenomenon. Bottom line: We believe the continued double-digit cloud growth and climbing levels of high-end spending confirm that organizations remain deeply committed to cloud infrastructure. Despite concerns about pricing or sporadic examples of repatriation, the data suggests that companies’ appetite for compute resources—in a large part fueled by AI—will keep the cloud market on a steady upward trajectory and all-in will surpass $1T in 2025. Next up is a prediction that is maybe a bit counterintuitive. Specifically, we think AI supercharges robotic process automation and is not a replacement. Early on, customers were thinking that gen AI in particular could do what RPA does but we don’t see it that way. In fact in many ways we look at RPA as very useful plumbing for enterprise AI and automation. Customer data suggests that they see AI as complementing RPA and capabilities such as process mining, process mapping, workflow optimization and the like will support agentic workflows. In the ETR XY chart above, you can see Microsoft Power Automate in the upper right and a number of other firms such as UiPath Inc., which is positioning for agentic with agent management frameworks and strong process knowledge. Others on this chart are positioning for agentic AI as well and we’re particularly excited about Celonis SE, which we’ve covered quite extensively on this program. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We see a resurgence in RPA spending and business process automation initiatives, despite initial concerns that AI would render traditional RPA obsolete. Rather than displacing RPA, emerging AI capabilities are proving complementary, giving rise to “intelligent automation” solutions that enhance the breadth and depth of what can be automated. Bottom line: We believe that RPA’s return to favor reflects its evolving role within a broader automation strategy. Rather than being displaced by AI, RPA is bolstered by these new capabilities, creating powerful, end-to-end automation solutions that promise enhanced efficiency and agility for organizations that embrace the synergy. Our next prediction is that IPOs will begin to come back in the first half, but really those companies that need the money will go out. We think others will wait to see the impact of the Trump administration, what happens with interest rates and the like. Above we’re showing a sit-down we had at our NYSE studio with Veeam Inc. CEO Anand Esweran. Veeam is owned by Insight Partners, which just did a private raise to prepare for what we believe will be an IPO later this year or more likely in 2026. Veeam doesn’t need the cash so it isn’t in a rush. Blue Yonder Group Inc., Snyk and the well-funded Databricks are other candidates. In addition, we’re watching firms such as Cohesity Inc., Cerberus Systems Inc., Klarna Bank AB, CoreWeave, Chime Financial Inc., Netskope Inc., Neo4j Inc., Stripe Inc. and Celonis. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We foresee a surge in IPO activity among technology firms that have been taken private in recent years or have remained in the private domain. Rising interest rates, lofty private valuations and the eventual need for liquidity events are converging to create a ripe environment for public offerings. Major private equity players such as Thoma Bravo and Vista, which acquired numerous software companies, are now incentivized to return these assets to public markets, much like the recent announcement involving SailPoint Technologies Inc. Bottom line: We believe that the combination of liquidity needs, rising interest rates, and sustained investor appetite for innovative tech solutions will drive an uptick in IPOs. Expect many of the names previously taken private or still in private hands to test the public markets as they seek funding for expansion, returns for backers, and the chance to better compete in an evolving landscape. We believe the point of control will clearly shift from the database up the stack towards governance catalogs that control open table formats. But the value will we think leapfrog that layer further up into the application stack, with agentic AI taking center stage, notwithstanding the security challenges we cited earlier. Above we show data from an August ETR. The gray bar is the one that is relevant where Iceberg, despite its newness, leads with 40% of customers at that time planning to use Iceberg. We think this trend will dramatically accelerate in 2025 with Delta and Iceberg merging via Databricks’ acquisition of Tabular. As the point of control shifts up the stack, the data platform players such as Snowflake Inc. and Databricks will increasingly run into the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow and other SaaS players that are taking greater control over the data that lives within their application stacks. These SaaS platforms not only have data but they have process knowledge, business logic and metadata, and are in a strong position to vie for control of the data. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We believe the next phase of data and AI evolution will move beyond separating compute from storage and cloud scalability. Increasingly, we believe the emphasis will be on how organizations refine, harmonize and govern data — rather than just where that data resides. In recent years, enterprises have focused heavily on laying foundational infrastructure for real-time analytics and AI. Now, our research suggests investment is shifting toward customer-facing applications and sophisticated data management layers, including semantic solutions that harmonize data, data catalogs and governance frameworks. Bottom line: We believe that as enterprise data ecosystems become more fluid — where any compute engine can tap into any data source — governance, discoverability and semantic consistency will define market winners. Though Databricks and Snowflake appear to be leading the charge, hyperscalers remain well-positioned thanks to their scale and go-to-market muscle. Ultimately, organizations seeking to stay competitive must invest in advanced data management and semantic tooling that aligns real-time processing with broader AI objectives. Our last prediction is one that addresses some of the media hype around jobs. We don’t believe AI will dramatically kill jobs in 2025 and spike unemployment. And we think that longer-term, AI will create more jobs that require different skill sets. This data we’re showing above is from an ETR survey and a new feature they’ve announced. We’ve highlighted in red the salient responses where 600 customers say they’re not slowing hiring because of AI and they’re not reducing headcount. The following provides additional context for this prediction: Our most recent AI product survey data suggests that, contrary to popular headlines, AI initiatives are not yet displacing jobs at large scale. Though a handful of organizations have blamed layoffs on new AI-driven productivity gains, the overwhelming majority of survey respondents do not anticipate reducing headcount or slowing hiring because of AI this year. Notably, many organizations are not yet measuring AI’s return on investment in strictly financial terms; instead, they perceive its value in less quantifiable ways — such as improved quality, speed and productivity. Bottom line: We believe that, at least in the near term, AI will not significantly reduce enterprise headcount. Instead, organizations are investing in people who can design, deploy and manage AI systems. Over the longer run, better measurement of ROI and further technological maturity may change the equation, but for 2025, AI appears more poised to create new opportunities than to eliminate jobs. One last added prediction. We’ve been outspoken about Intel and predict it will have no choice but to spin out its foundry business in 2025. Our concern is that Intel’s design business will be acquired in this process, but we most certainly hope not. We believe it’s in the industry’s and country’s best interests for Intel to remain independent. The contributions Intel has made to the technology industry are enormous. Intel was the IBM of its day, an iconic innovator that supported two decades of innovation, the mainspring of which was microprocessor-based computing. For Intel to be subsumed by a firm with a higher market cap or inflated valuations from AI expectations would be a shame. Read our plan to save Intel and maintain its independence, while securing the long-term interests of the United States. We call on the current administration and the spate of tech CEOs who have come out of the woodwork to support President Trump to deeply consider how Intel enabled today’s tech companies to thrive and do your part to help Intel make an Apple-like comeback. What do you think? How do you see 2025 shaping up? What are your predictions for the year? Please let us know.

Jeffrey Emanuel January 25, 2025 60 min read As someone who spent ~10 years working as a generalist investment analyst at various long/short hedge funds (including stints at Millennium and Balyasny), while also being something of a math and computer nerd who has been studying deep learning since 2010 (back when Geoff Hinton was still talking about Restricted Boltzmann Machines and everything was still programmed using MATLAB, and researchers were still trying to show that they could get better results at classifying handwritten digits than by using Support Vector Machines), I'd like to think that I have a fairly unusual perspective on how AI technology is developing and how this relates to equity valuations in the stock market. For the past few years, I have been working more as a developer, and have several popular open-source projects for working with various forms of AI models/services (e.g., see LLM Aided OCR, Swiss Army Llama, Fast Vector Similarity, Source to Prompt, and Pastel Inference Layer for a few recent examples). Basically, I am using these frontier models all day, every day, in about as intense a way as possible. I have 3 Claude accounts so I don't run out of requests, and signed up for ChatGPT Pro within minutes of it being available. I also try to keep on top of the latest research advances, and carefully read all the major technical report papers that come out from the major AI labs. So I think I have a pretty good read on the space and how things are developing. At the same time, I've shorted a ton of stocks in my life and have won the best idea prize on the Value Investors Club twice (for TMS long and PDH short if you're keeping track at home). I say this not to brag, but rather to help establish my bona fides as someone who could opine on the subject without coming across as hopelessly naive to either technologists or professional investors. And while there are surely many people who know the math/science better, and people who are better at long/short investing in the stock market than me, I doubt there are very many who are in the middle of the Venn diagram to the extent I can claim to be. With all that said, whenever I meet with and chat with my friends and ex colleagues from the hedge fund world, the conversation quickly turns to Nvidia. It's not every day that a company goes from relative obscurity to being worth more than the combined stock markets of England, France, or Germany! And naturally, these friends want to know my thoughts on the subject. Because I am such a dyed-in-the-wool believer in the long term transformative impact of this technology— I truly believe it's going to radically change nearly every aspect of our economy and society in the next 5-10 years, with basically no historical precedent— it has been hard for me to make the argument that Nvidia's momentum is going to slow down or stop anytime soon. But even though I've thought the valuation was just too rich for my blood for the past year or so, a confluence of recent developments has caused me to flip a bit to my usual instinct, which is to be a bit more contrarian in outlook and to question the consensus when it seems to be more than priced in. The saying "what the wise man believes in the beginning, the fool believes in the end" became famous for a good reason. Before we get into the developments that give me pause, let's pause to briefly review the bull case for NVDA shares, which is basically now known by everyone and his brother. Deep learning and AI are the most transformative technologies since the internet, and poised to change basically everything in our society. Nvidia has somehow ended up with something close to a monopoly in terms of the share of aggregate industry capex that is spent on training and inference infrastructure. Some of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, etc., have all decided that they must do and spend whatever it takes to stay competitive in this space because they simply cannot afford to be left behind. The amount of capex dollars, gigawatts of electricity used, square footage of new-build data centers, and, of course, the number of GPUs, has absolutely exploded and seems to show no sign of slowing down. And Nvidia is able to earn insanely high 90%+ gross margins on the most high-end, datacenter oriented products. We've just scratched the surface here of the bull case. There are many additional aspects to it now, which have made even people who were already very bullish to become incrementally more bullish. Besides things like the rise of humanoid robots, which I suspect is going to take most people by surprise when they are rapidly able to perform a huge number of tasks that currently require an unskilled (or even skilled) human worker (e.g., doing laundry, cleaning, organizing, and cooking; doing construction work like renovating a bathroom or building a house in a team of workers; running a warehouse and driving forklifts, etc.), there are other factors which most people haven't even considered. One major thing that you hear the smart crowd talking about is the rise of "a new scaling law," which has created a new paradigm thinking about how compute needs will increase over time. The original scaling law, which is what has been driving progress in AI since AlexNet appeared in 2012 and the Transformer architecture was invented in 2017, is the pre-training scaling law: that the more billions (and now trillions) worth of tokens we can use as training data, and the larger the parameter count of the models we are training, and the more FLOPS of compute that we expend on training those models on those tokens, the better the performance of the resulting models on a large variety of highly useful downstream tasks. Not only that, but this improvement is somewhat knowable, to the point where the leading AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic have a pretty good idea of just how good their latest models would be even before they started the actual training runs— in some cases, predicting the benchmarks of the final models to within a couple percentage points. This "original scaling law" has been vitally important, but always caused some doubts in the minds of people projecting the future with it. For one thing, we seem to have already exhausted the world's accumulated set of high quality training data. Of course, that's not literally true— there are still so many old books and periodicals that haven't yet been properly digitized, and even if they have, are not properly licensed for use as training data. The problem is that, even if you give credit for all that stuff— say the sum total of "professionally" produced English language written content from the year 1500 to, say, the year 2000, it's not such a tremendous amount in percentage terms when you're talking about a training corpus of nearly 15 trillion tokens, which is the scale of current frontier models. For a quick reality check of those numbers: Google Books has digitized around 40mm books so far; if a typical book has 50k to 100k words, or 65k to 130k tokens, then that's between 2.6T and 5.2T tokens just from books, though surely a large chunk of that is already included in the training corpora used by the big labs, whether it's strictly legal or not. And there are lots of academic papers, with the arXiv website alone having over 2mm papers. And the Library of Congress has over 3 billion digitized newspaper pages. Taken together, that could be as much as 7T tokens in total, but since much of this is in fact included in training corpora, the remaining "incremental" training data probably isn't all that significant in the grand scheme of things. Of course, there are other ways to gather more training data. You could automatically transcribe every single YouTube video for example, and use that text. And while that might be helpful on the margin, it's certainly of much lower quality than, say, a highly respected textbook on Organic Chemistry as a source of useful knowledge about the world. So we've always had a looming "data wall" when it comes to the original scaling law; although we know we can keep shoveling more and more capex into GPUs and building more and more data centers, it's a lot harder to mass produce useful new human knowledge which is correct and incremental to what is already out there. Now, one intriguing response to this has been the rise of "synthetic data," which is text that is itself the output of an LLM. And while this seems almost nonsensical that it would work to "get high on your own supply" as a way of improving model quality, it actually seems to work very well in practice, at least in the domain of math, logic, and computer programming. The reason, of course, is that these are areas where we can mechanically check and prove the correctness of things. So we can sample from the vast universe of possible math theorems or possible Python scripts, and then actually check if they are correct, and only include them in our corpus if they are. And in this way, we can very dramatically expand our collection of high quality training data, at least in these kinds of areas. And then there are all the other kinds of data we could be training AI on besides text. For example, what if we take the entire whole genome sequencing (around 200 GB to 300 GB uncompressed for a single human being) for 100 million people? That's a lot of data obviously, although the vast majority of it would be nearly identical between any two people. Of course, this could be misleading to compare to textual data from books and the internet for various reasons: But it's still another large source of diverse information that we could train huge models on in the future, which is why I included it. So while there is some hope in terms of being able to capture more and more additional training data, if you look at the rate at which training corpora have grown in recent years, it quickly becomes obvious that we are close to hitting a wall in terms of data availability for "generally useful" knowledge that can get us closer to the ultimate goal of getting artificial super-intelligence which is 10x smarter than John von Neumann and is an absolute world-class expert on every specialty known to man. Besides the limited amount of available data, there have always been a couple other things that have lurked in the back of the mind of proponents of the pre-training scaling law. A big one of these is, after you've finished training the model, what are you supposed to do with all that compute infrastructure? Train the next model? Sure, you can do that, but given the rapid improvement in GPU speed and capacity, and the importance of electricity and other opex in the economic calculations, does it even really make sense to use your 2 year old cluster to train your new model? Surely you'd rather use the brand new data center you just built that costs 10x the old data center and is 20x more powerful because of better technology. The problem is, at some point you do need to amortize the up-front cost of these investments and recoup it with a stream of (hopefully positive) operating profit, right? The market is so excited about AI that it has thankfully ignored this, allowing companies like OpenAI to post breathtaking from-inception, cumulative operating losses while garnering increasingly eye-popping valuations in follow-up investment rounds (although, to their credit, they have also been able to demonstrate very fast growing revenues). But eventually, for this situation to be sustainable over a full market cycle, these data center costs do need to eventually be recouped, hopefully with a profit, which over time is competitive with other investment opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis. OK, so that was the pre-training scaling law. What's this "new" scaling law? Well, that's something that people really just started focusing on in the past year: inference time compute scaling. Before, the vast majority of all the compute you'd expend in the process was the up-front training compute to create the model in the first place. Once you had the trained model, performing inference on that model— i.e., asking a question or having the LLM perform some kind of task for you— used a certain, limited amount of compute. Critically, the total amount of inference compute (measured in various ways, such as FLOPS, in GPU memory footprint, etc.) was much, much less than what was required for the pre-training phase. Of course, the amount of inference compute does flex up when you increase the context window size of the models and the amount of output that you generate from them in one go (although researchers have made breathtaking algorithmic improvements on this front relative to the initial quadratic scaling people originally expected in scaling this up). But essentially, until recently, inference compute was generally a lot less intensive than training compute, and scaled basically linearly with the number of requests you are handling— the more demand for text completions from ChatGPT, for instance, the more inference compute you used up. With the advent of the revolutionary Chain-of-Thought ("COT") models introduced in the past year, most noticeably in OpenAI's flagship O1 model (but very recently in DeepSeek's new R1 model, which we will talk about later in much more detail), all that changed. Instead of the amount of inference compute being directly proportional to the length of the output text generated by the model (scaling up for larger context windows, model size, etc.), these new COT models also generate intermediate "logic tokens"; think of this as a sort of scratchpad or "internal monologue" of the model while it's trying to solve your problem or complete its assigned task. This represents a true sea change in how inference compute works: now, the more tokens you use for this internal chain of thought process, the better the quality of the final output you can provide the user. In effect, it's like giving a human worker more time and resources to accomplish a task, so they can double and triple check their work, do the same basic task in multiple different ways and verify that they come out the same way; take the result they came up with and "plug it in" to the formula to check that it actually does solve the equation, etc. It turns out that this approach works almost amazingly well; it is essentially leveraging the long anticipated power of what is called "reinforcement learning" with the power of the Transformer architecture. It directly addresses the single biggest weakness of the otherwise phenomenally successful Transformer model, which is its propensity to "hallucinate". Basically, the way Transformers work in terms of predicting the next token at each step is that, if they start out on a bad "path" in their initial response, they become almost like a prevaricating child who tries to spin a yarn about why they are actually correct, even if they should have realized mid-stream using common sense that what they are saying couldn't possibly be correct. Because the models are always seeking to be internally consistent and to have each successive generated token flow naturally from the preceding tokens and context, it's very hard for them to course-correct and backtrack. By breaking the inference process into what is effectively many intermediate stages, they can try lots of different things and see what's working and keep trying to course-correct and try other approaches until they can reach a fairly high threshold of confidence that they aren't talking nonsense. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this approach, beyond the fact that it works at all, is that the more logic/COT tokens you use, the better it works. Suddenly, you now have an additional dial you can turn so that, as you increase the amount of COT reasoning tokens (which uses a lot more inference compute, both in terms of FLOPS and memory), the higher the probability is that you will give a correct response— code that runs the first time without errors, or a solution to a logic problem without an obviously wrong deductive step. I can tell you from a lot of firsthand experience that, as good as Anthropic's Claude3.5 Sonnet model is at Python programming— and it is indeed VERY good— whenever you need to generate anything long and complicated, it invariably ends up making one or more stupid mistakes. Now, these mistakes are usually pretty easy to fix, and in fact you can normally fix them by simply feeding the errors generated by the Python interpreter, without any further explanation, as a follow-up inference prompt (or, more usefully, paste in the complete set of detected "problems" found in the code by your code editor, using what something called a Linter), it was still an annoying additional step. And when the code becomes very long or very complicated, it can sometimes take a lot longer to fix, and might even require some manual debugging by hand. The first time I tried the O1 model from OpenAI was like a revelation: I was amazed how often the code would be perfect the very first time. And that's because the COT process automatically finds and fixes problems before they ever make it to a final response token in the answer the model gives you. In fact, the O1 model used in OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus subscription for $20/month is basically the same model as the one used in the O1-Pro model featured in their new ChatGPT Pro subscription for 10x the price ($200/month, which raised plenty of eyebrows in the developer community); the main difference is that O1-Pro thinks for a lot longer before responding, generating vastly more COT logic tokens, and consuming a far larger amount of inference compute for every response. This is quite striking in that, even a very long and complex prompt for Claude3.5 Sonnet or GPT4o, with ~400kb+ of context given, generally takes less than 10 seconds to begin responding, and often less than 5 seconds. Whereas that same prompt to O1-Pro could easily take 5+ MINUTES before you get a response (although OpenAI does show you some of the "reasoning steps" that are generated during the process while you wait; critically, OpenAI has decided, presumably for trade secret related reasons,to hide from you the exact reasoning tokens it generates, showing you instead a highly abbreviated summary of these). As you can probably imagine, there are tons of contexts where accuracy is paramount— where you'd rather give up and tell the user you can't do it at all rather than give an answer that could be trivially proven wrong or which involves hallucinated facts or otherwise specious reasoning. Anything involving money/transactions, medical stuff, legal stuff, just to name a few. Basically, wherever the cost of inference is trivial relative to the hourly all-in compensation of the human knowledge worker who is interacting with the AI system, that's a case where it become a complete no-brainer to dial up the COT compute (the major drawback is that it increases the latency of responses by a lot, so there are still some contexts where you might prefer to iterate faster by getting lower latency responses that are less accurate or correct). Some of the most exciting news in the AI world came out just a few weeks ago and concerned OpenAI's new unreleased O3 model, which was able to solve a large variety of tasks that were previously deemed to be out of reach of current AI approaches in the near term. And the way it was able to do these hardest problems (which include exceptionally tough "foundational" math problems that would be very hard for even highly skilled professional mathematicians to solve), is that OpenAI threw insane amount of compute resources at the problems— in some cases, spending $3k+ worth of compute power to solve a single task (compare this to traditional inference costs for a single task, which would be unlikely to exceed a couple dollars using regular Transformer models without chain-of-thought). It doesn't take an AI genius to realize that this development creates a new scaling law that is totally independent of the original pre-training scaling law. Now, you still want to train the best model you can by cleverly leveraging as much compute as you can and as many trillion tokens of high quality training data as possible, but that's just the beginning of the story in this new world; now, you could easily use incredibly huge amounts of compute just to do inference from these models at a very high level of confidence or when trying to solve extremely tough problems that require "genius level" reasoning to avoid all the potential pitfalls that would lead a regular LLM astray. Even if you believe, as I do, that the future prospects for AI are almost unimaginably bright, the question still remains, "Why should one company extract the majority of the profit pool from this technology?" There are certainly many historical cases where a very important new technology changed the world, but the main winners were not the companies that seemed the most promising during the initial stages of the process. The Wright Brothers' airplane company in all its current incarnations across many different firms today isn't worth more than $10b despite them inventing and perfecting the technology well ahead of everyone else. And while Ford has a respectable market cap of $40b today, it's just 1.1% of Nvidia's current market cap. To understand this, it's important to really understand why Nvidia is currently capturing so much of the pie today. After all, they aren't the only company that even makes GPUs. AMD makes respectable GPUs that, on paper, have comparable numbers of transistors, which are made using similar process nodes, etc. Sure, they aren't as fast or as advanced as Nvidia's GPUs, but it's not like the Nvidia GPUs are 10x faster or anything like that. In fact, in terms of naive/raw dollars per FLOP, AMD GPUs are something like half the price of Nvidia GPUs. Looking at other semiconductor markets such as the DRAM market, despite the fact that it is also very highly consolidated with only 3 meaningful global players (Samsung, Micron, SK-Hynix), gross margins in the DRAM market range from negative at the bottom of the cycle to ~60% at the very top of the cycle, with an average in the 20% range. Compare that to Nvidia's overall gross margin in recent quarters of ~75%, which is dragged down by the lower-margin and more commoditized consumer 3D graphics category. So how is this possible? Well, the main reasons have to do with software— better drivers that "just work" on Linux and which are highly battle-tested and reliable (unlike AMD, which is notorious for the low quality and instability of their Linux drivers), and highly optimized open-source code in popular libraries such as PyTorch that has been tuned to work really well on Nvidia GPUs. It goes beyond that though— the very programming framework that coders use to write low-level code that is optimized for GPUs, CUDA, is totally proprietary to Nvidia, and it has become a de facto standard. If you want to hire a bunch of extremely talented programmers who know how to make things go really fast on GPUs, and pay them $650k/year or whatever the going rate is for people with that particular expertise, chances are that they are going to "think" and work in CUDA. Besides software superiority, the other major thing that Nvidia has going for it is what is known as interconnect— essentially, the bandwidth that connects together thousands of GPUs together efficiently so they can be jointly harnessed to train today's leading-edge foundational models. In short, the key to efficient training is to keep all the GPUs as fully utilized as possible all the time— not waiting around idling until they receive the next chunk of data they need to compute the next step of the training process. The bandwidth requirements are extremely high— much, much higher than the typical bandwidth that is needed in traditional data center use cases. You can't really use traditional networking gear or fiber optics for this kind of interconnect, since it would introduce too much latency and wouldn't give you the pure terabytes per second of bandwidth that is needed to keep all the GPUs constantly busy. Nvidia made an incredibly smart decision to purchase the Israeli company Mellanox back in 2019 for a mere $6.9b, and this acquisition is what provided them with their industry leading interconnect technology. Note that interconnect speed is a lot more relevant to the training process, where you have to harness together the output of thousands of GPUs at the same time, than the inference process (including COT inference), which can use just a handful of GPUs— all you need is enough VRAM to store the quantized (compressed) model weights of the already-trained model. So those are arguably the major components of Nvidia's "moat" and how it has been able to maintain such high margins for so long (there is also a "flywheel" aspect to things, where they aggressively invest their super-normal profits into tons of R&D, which in turn helps them improve their tech at a faster rate than the competition, so they are always in the lead in terms of raw performance). But as was pointed out earlier, what customers really tend to care about, all other things being equal, is performance per dollar (both in up-front capex cost of equipment and in energy usage, so performance per watt), and even though Nvidia's GPUs are certainly the fastest, they are not the best price/performance when measured naively in terms of FLOPS. But the thing is, all other things are NOT equal, and the fact that AMD's drivers suck, that popular AI software libraries don't run as well on AMD GPUs, that you can't find really good GPU experts who specialize in AMD GPUs outside of the gaming world (why would they bother when there is more demand in the market for CUDA experts?), that you can't wire thousands of them together as effectively because of lousy interconnect technology for AMD— all this means that AMD is basically not competitive in the high-end data center world, and doesn't seem to have very good prospects for getting there in the near term. Well, that all sounds very bullish for Nvidia, right? Now you can see why the stock is trading at such a huge valuation! But what are the other clouds on the horizon? Well, there are few that I think merit significant attention. Some have been lurking in the background for the last few years, but too small to make a dent considering how quickly the pie has been growing, but where they are getting ready to potentially inflect upwards. Others are very recent developments (as in, the last 2 weeks) that might dramatically change the near-term trajectory of incremental GPU demand. At a very high level, you can think of things like this: Nvidia operated in a pretty niche area for a very long time; they had very limited competition, and the competition wasn't particular profitable or growing fast enough to ever pose a real threat, since they didn't have the capital needed to really apply pressure to a market leader like Nvidia. The gaming market was large and growing, but didn't feature earth shattering margins or particularly fabulous year over year growth rates. A few big tech companies started ramping up hiring and spending on machine learning and AI efforts around 2016-2017, but it was never a truly significant line item for any of them on an aggregate basis— more of a "moonshot" R&D expenditure. But once the big AI race started in earnest with the release of ChatGPT in 2022— only a bit over 2 years ago, although it seems like a lifetime ago in terms of developments— that situation changed very dramatically. Suddenly, big companies were ready to spend many, many billions of dollars incredibly quickly. The number of researchers showing up at the big research conferences like Neurips and ICML went up very, very dramatically. All the smart students who might have previously studied financial derivatives were instead studying Transformers, and $1mm+ compensation packages for non-executive engineering roles (i.e., for independent contributors not managing a team) became the norm at the leading AI labs. It takes a while to change the direction of a massive cruise ship; and even if you move really quickly and spend billions, it takes a year or more to build greenfield data centers and order all the equipment (with ballooning lead times) and get it all set up and working. It takes a long time to hire and onboard even smart coders before they can really hit their stride and familiarize themselves with the existing codebases and infrastructure. But now, you can imagine that absolutely biblical amounts of capital, brainpower, and effort are being expended in this area. And Nvidia has the biggest target of any player on their back, because they are the ones who are making the lion's share of the profits TODAY, not in some hypothetical future where the AI runs our whole lives. So the very high level takeaway is basically that "markets find a way"; they find alternative, radically innovative new approaches to building hardware that leverage completely new ideas to sidestep barriers that help prop up Nvidia's moat. For example, so-called "wafer scale" AI training chips from Cerebras, which dedicate an entire 300mm silicon wafer to an absolutely gargantuan chip that contains orders of magnitude more transistors and cores on a single chip (see this recent blog post from them explaining how they were able to solve the "yield problem" that had been preventing this approach from being economically practical in the past). To put this into perspective, if you compare Cerebras' newest WSE-3 chip to Nvidia's flagship data-center GPU, the H100, the Cerebras chip has a total die area of 46,225 square millimeters compared to just 814 for the H100 (and the H100 is itself considered an enormous chip by industry standards); that's a multiple of ~57x! And instead of having 132 "streaming multiprocessor" cores enabled on the chip like the H100 has, the Cerebras chip has ~900,000 cores (granted, each of these cores is smaller and does a lot less, but it's still an almost unfathomably large number in comparison). In more concrete apples-to-apples terms, the Cerebras chip can do around ~32x the FLOPS in AI contexts as a single H100 chip. Since an H100 sells for close to $40k a pop, you can imagine that the WSE-3 chip isn't cheap. So why does this all matter? Well, instead of trying to battle Nvidia head-on by using a similar approach and trying to match the Mellanox interconnect technology, Cerebras has used a radically innovative approach to do an end-run around the interconnect problem: inter-processor bandwidth becomes much less of an issue when everything is running on the same super-sized chip. You don't even need to have the same level of interconnect because one mega chip replaces tons of H100s. And the Cerebras chips also work extremely well for AI inference tasks. In fact, you can try it today for free here and use Meta's very respectable Llama-3.3-70B model. It responds basically instantaneously, at ~1,500 tokens per second. To put that into perspective, anything above 30 tokens per second feels relatively snappy to users based on comparisons to ChatGPT and Claude, and even 10 tokens per second is fast enough that you can basically read the response while it's being generated. Cerebras is also not alone; there are other companies, like Groq (not to be confused with the Grok model family trained by Elon Musk's X AI). Groq has taken yet another innovative approach to solving the same fundamental problem. Instead of trying to compete with Nvidia's CUDA software stack directly, they've developed what they call a "tensor processing unit" (TPU) that is specifically designed for the exact mathematical operations that deep learning models need to perform. Their chips are designed around a concept called "deterministic compute," which means that, unlike traditional GPUs where the exact timing of operations can vary, their chips execute operations in a completely predictable way every single time. This might sound like a minor technical detail, but it actually makes a massive difference for both chip design and software development. Because the timing is completely deterministic, Groq can optimize their chips in ways that would be impossible with traditional GPU architectures. As a result, they've been demonstrating for the past 6+ months inference speeds of over 500 tokens per second with the Llama series of models and other open source models, far exceeding what's possible with traditional GPU setups. Like Cerebras, this is available today and you can try it for free here. Using a comparable Llama3 model with "speculative decoding," Groq is able to generate 1,320 tokens per second, on par with Cerebras and far in excess of what is possible using regular GPUs. Now, you might ask what the point is of achieving 1,000+ tokens per second when users seem pretty satisfied with ChatGPT, which is operating at less than 10% of that speed. And the thing is, it does matter. It makes it a lot faster to iterate and not lose focus as a human knowledge worker when you get instant feedback. And if you're using the model programmatically via the API, which is increasingly where much of the demand is coming from, then it can enable whole new classes of applications that require multi-stage inference (where the output of previous stages is used as input in successive stages of prompting/inference) or which require low-latency responses, such as content moderation, fraud detection, dynamic pricing, etc. But even more fundamentally, the faster you can serve requests, the faster you can cycle things, and the busier you can keep the hardware. Although Groq's hardware is extremely expensive, clocking in at $2mm to $3mm for a single server, it ends up costing far less per request fulfilled if you have enough demand to keep the hardware busy all the time. And like Nvidia with CUDA, a huge part of Groq's advantage comes from their own proprietary software stack. They are able to take the same open source models that other companies like Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral develop and release for free, and decompose them in special ways that allow them to run dramatically faster on their specific hardware. Like Cerebras, they have taken different technical decisions to optimize certain particular aspects of the process, which allows them to do things in a fundamentally different way. In Groq's case, it's because they are entirely focused on inference level compute, not on training: all their special sauce hardware and software only give these huge speed and efficiency advantages when doing inference on an already trained model. But if the next big scaling law that people are excited about is for inference level compute— and if the biggest drawback of COT models is the high latency introduced by having to generate all those intermediate logic tokens before they can respond— then even a company that only does inference compute, but which does it dramatically faster and more efficiently than Nvidia can— can introduce a serious competitive threat in the coming years. At the very least, Cerebras and Groq can chip away at the lofty expectations for Nvidia's revenue growth over the next 2-3 years that are embedded in the current equity valuation. Besides these particularly innovative, if relatively unknown, startup competitors, there is some serious competition coming from some of Nvidia's biggest customers themselves who have been making custom silicon that specifically targets AI training and inference workloads. Perhaps the best known of these is Google, which has been developing its own proprietary TPUs since 2016. Interestingly, although it briefly sold TPUs to external customers, Google has been using all its TPUs internally for the past several years, and it is already on its 6th generation of TPU hardware. Amazon has also been developing its own custom chips called Trainium2 and Inferentia2. And while Amazon is building out data centers featuring billions of dollars of Nvidia GPUs, they are also at the same time investing many billions in other data centers that use these internal chips. They have one cluster that they are bringing online for Anthropic that features over 400k chips. Amazon gets a lot of flak for totally bungling their internal AI model development, squandering massive amounts of internal compute resources on models that ultimately are not competitive, but the custom silicon is another matter. Again, they don't necessarily need their chips to be better and faster than Nvidia's. What they need is for their chips to be good enough, but build them at a breakeven gross margin instead of the ~90%+ gross margin that Nvidia earns on its H100 business. OpenAI has also announced their plans to build custom chips, and they (together with Microsoft) are obviously the single largest user of Nvidia's data center hardware. As if that weren't enough, Microsoft have themselves announced their own custom chips! And Apple, the most valuable technology company in the world, has been blowing away expectations for years now with their highly innovative and disruptive custom silicon operation, which now completely trounces the CPUs from both Intel and AMD in terms of performance per watt, which is the most important factor in mobile (phone/tablet/laptop) applications. And they have been making their own internally designed GPUs and "Neural Processors" for years, even though they have yet to really demonstrate the utility of such chips outside of their own custom applications, like the advanced software based image processing used in the iPhone's camera. While Apple's focus seems somewhat orthogonal to these other players in terms of its mobile-first, consumer oriented, "edge compute" focus, if it ends up spending enough money on its new contract with OpenAI to provide AI services to iPhone users, you have to imagine that they have teams looking into making their own custom silicon for inference/training (although given their secrecy, you might never even know about it directly!). Now, it's no secret that there is a strong power law distribution of Nvidia's hyper-scaler customer base, with the top handful of customers representing the lion's share of high-margin revenue. How should one think about the future of this business when literally every single one of these VIP customers is building their own custom chips specifically for AI training and inference? When thinking about all this, you should keep one incredibly important thing in mind: Nvidia is largely an IP based company. They don't make their own chips. The true special sauce for making these incredible devices arguably comes more from TSMC, the actual fab, and ASML, which makes the special EUV lithography machines used by TSMC to make these leading-edge process node chips. And that's critically important, because TSMC will sell their most advanced chips to anyone who comes to them with enough up-front investment and is willing to guarantee a certain amount of volume. They don't care if it's for Bitcoin mining ASICs, GPUs, TPUs, mobile phone SoCs, etc. As much as senior chip designers at Nvidia earn per year, surely some of the best of them could be lured away by these other tech behemoths for enough cash and stock. And once they have a team and resources, they can design innovative chips (again, perhaps not even 50% as advanced as an H100, but with that Nvidia gross margin, there is plenty of room to work with) in 2 to 3 years, and thanks for TSMC, they can turn those into actual silicon using the exact same process node technology as Nvidia. As if these looming hardware threats weren't bad enough, there are a few developments in the software world in the last couple years that, while they started out slowly, are now picking up real steam and could pose a serious threat to the software dominance of Nvidia's CUDA. The first of these is the horrible Linux drivers for AMD GPUs. Remember we talked about how AMD has inexplicably allowed these drivers to suck for years despite leaving massive amounts of money on the table? Well, amusingly enough, the infamous hacker George Hotz (famous for jailbreaking the original iphone as a teenager, and currently the CEO of self-driving startup Comma.ai and AI computer company Tiny Corp, which also makes the open-source tinygrad AI software framework), recently announced that he was sick and tired of dealing with AMD's bad drivers, and desperately wanted to be able to to leverage the lower cost AMD GPUs in their TinyBox AI computers (which come in multiple flavors, some of which use Nvidia GPUs, and some of which use AMD GPUS). Well, he is making his own custom drivers and software stack for AMD GPUs without any help from AMD themselves; on Jan. 15th of 2025, he tweeted via his company's X account that "We are one piece away from a completely sovereign stack on AMD, the RDNA3 assembler. We have our own driver, runtime, libraries, and emulator. (all in ~12,000 lines!)" Given his track record and skills, it is likely that they will have this all working in the next couple months, and this would allow for a lot of exciting possibilities of using AMD GPUs for all sorts of applications where companies currently feel compelled to pay up for Nvidia GPUs. OK, well that's just a driver for AMD, and it's not even done yet. What else is there? Well, there are a few other areas on the software side that are a lot more impactful. For one, there is now a massive concerted effort across many large tech companies and the open source software community at large to make more generic AI software frameworks that have CUDA as just one of many "compilation targets". That is, you write your software using higher-level abstractions, and the system itself can automatically turn those high-level constructs into super well-tuned low-level code that works extremely well on CUDA. But because it's done at this higher level of abstraction, it can just as easily get compiled into low-level code that works extremely well on lots of other GPUs and TPUs from a variety of providers, such as the massive number of custom chips in the pipeline from every big tech company. The most famous examples of these frameworks are MLX (sponsored primarily by Apple), Triton (sponsored primarily by OpenAI), and JAX (developed by Google). MLX is particularly interesting because it provides a PyTorch-like API that can run efficiently on Apple Silicon, showing how these abstraction layers can enable AI workloads to run on completely different architectures. Triton, meanwhile, has become increasingly popular as it allows developers to write high-performance code that can be compiled to run on various hardware targets without having to understand the low-level details of each platform. These frameworks allow developers to write their code once using high powered abstractions and then target tons of platforms automatically— doesn't that sound like a better way to do things, which would give you a lot more flexibility in terms of how you actually run the code? In the 1980s, all the most popular, best selling software was written in hand-tuned assembly language. The PKZIP compression utility for example was hand crafted to maximize speed, to the point where a competently coded version written in the standard C programming language and compiled using the best available optimizing compilers at the time, would run at probably half the speed of the hand-tuned assembly code. The same is true for other popular software packages like WordStar, VisiCalc, and so on. Over time, compilers kept getting better and better, and every time the CPU architectures changed (say, from Intel releasing the 486, then the Pentium, and so on), that hand-rolled assembler would often have to be thrown out and rewritten, something that only the smartest coders were capable of (sort of like how CUDA experts are on a different level in the job market versus a "regular" software developer). Eventually, things converged so that the speed benefits of hand-rolled assembly were outweighed dramatically by the flexibility of being able to write code in a high-level language like C or C++, where you rely on the compiler to make things run really optimally on the given CPU. Nowadays, very little new code is written in assembly. I believe a similar transformation will end up happening for AI training and inference code, for similar reasons: computers are good at optimization, and flexibility and speed of development is increasingly the more important factor— especially if it also allows you to save dramatically on your hardware bill because you don't need to keep paying the "CUDA tax" that gives Nvidia 90%+ margins. Yet another area where you might see things change dramatically is that CUDA might very well end up being more of a high level abstraction itself— a "specification language" similar to Verilog (used as the industry standard to describe chip layouts) that skilled developers can use to describe high-level algorithms that involve massive parallelism (since they are already familiar with it, it's very well constructed, it's the lingua franca, etc.), but then instead of having that code compiled for use on Nvidia GPUs like you would normally do, it can instead be fed as source code into an LLM which can port it into whatever low-level code is understood by the new Cerebras chip, or the new Amazon Trainium2, or the new Google TPUv6, etc. This isn't as far off as you might think; it's probably already well within reach using OpenAI's latest O3 model, and surely will be possible generally within a year or two. Perhaps the most shocking development which was alluded to earlier happened in the last couple of weeks. And that is the news that has totally rocked the AI world, and which has been dominating the discourse among knowledgeable people on Twitter despite its complete absence from any of the mainstream media outlets: that a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek released two new models that have basically world-competitive performance levels on par with the best models from OpenAI and Anthropic (blowing past the Meta Llama3 models and other smaller open source model players such as Mistral). These models are called DeepSeek-V3 (basically their answer to GPT-4o and Claude3.5 Sonnet) and DeepSeek-R1 (basically their answer to OpenAI's O1 model). Why is this all so shocking? Well, first of all, DeepSeek is a tiny Chinese company that reportedly has under 200 employees. The story goes that they started out as a quant trading hedge fund similar to TwoSigma or RenTec, but after Xi Jinping cracked down on that space, they used their math and engineering chops to pivot into AI research. Who knows if any of that is really true or if they are merely some kind of front for the CCP or the Chinese military. But the fact remains that they have released two incredibly detailed technical reports, for DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeekR1. These are heavy technical reports, and if you don't know a lot of linear algebra, you probably won't understand much. But what you should really try is to download the free DeepSeek app on the AppStore here and install it using a Google account to log in and give it a try (you can also install it on Android here), or simply try it out on your desktop computer in the browser here. Make sure to select the "DeepThink" option to enable chain-of-thought (the R1 model) and ask it to explain parts of the technical reports in simple terms. This will simultaneously show you a few important things: One, this model is absolutely legit. There is a lot of BS that goes on with AI benchmarks, which are routinely gamed so that models appear to perform great on the benchmarks but then suck in real world tests. Google is certainly the worst offender in this regard, constantly crowing about how amazing their LLMs are, when they are so awful in any real world test that they can't even reliably accomplish the simplest possible tasks, let alone challenging coding tasks. These DeepSeek models are not like that— the responses are coherent, compelling, and absolutely on the same level as those from OpenAI and Anthropic. Two, that DeepSeek has made profound advancements not just in model quality, but more importantly in model training and inference efficiency. By being extremely close to the hardware and by layering together a handful of distinct, very clever optimizations, DeepSeek was able to train these incredible models using GPUs in a dramatically more efficient way. By some measurements, over ~45x more efficiently than other leading-edge models. DeepSeek claims that the complete cost to train DeepSeek-V3 was just over $5mm. That is absolutely nothing by the standards of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., which were well into the $100mm+ level for training costs for a single model as early as 2024. How in the world could this be possible? How could this little Chinese company completely upstage all the smartest minds at our leading AI labs, which have 100 times more resources, headcount, payroll, capital, GPUs, etc? Wasn't China supposed to be crippled by Biden's restriction on GPU exports? Well, the details are fairly technical, but we can at least describe them at a high level. It might have just turned out that the relative GPU processing poverty of DeepSeek was the critical ingredient to make them more creative and clever, necessity being the mother of invention and all. A major innovation is their sophisticated mixed-precision training framework that lets them use 8-bit floating point numbers (FP8) throughout the entire training process. Most Western AI labs train using "full precision" 32-bit numbers (this basically specifies the number of gradations possible in describing the output of an artificial neuron; 8 bits in FP8 lets you store a much wider range of numbers than you might expect— it's not just limited to 256 different equal-sized magnitudes like you'd get with regular integers, but instead uses clever math tricks to store both very small and very large numbers— though naturally with less precision than you'd get with 32 bits.) The main tradeoff is that while FP32 can store numbers with incredible precision across an enormous range, FP8 sacrifices some of that precision to save memory and boost performance, while still maintaining enough accuracy for many AI workloads. DeepSeek cracked this problem by developing a clever system that breaks numbers into small tiles for activations and blocks for weights, and strategically uses high-precision calculations at key points in the network. Unlike other labs that train in high precision and then compress later (losing some quality in the process), DeepSeek's native FP8 approach means they get the massive memory savings without compromising performance. When you're training across thousands of GPUs, this dramatic reduction in memory requirements per GPU translates into needing far fewer GPUs overall. Another major breakthrough is their multi-token prediction system. Most Transformer based LLM models do inference by predicting the next token— one token at a time. DeepSeek figured out how to predict multiple tokens while maintaining the quality you'd get from single-token prediction. Their approach achieves about 85-90% accuracy on these additional token predictions, which effectively doubles inference speed without sacrificing much quality. The clever part is they maintain the complete causal chain of predictions, so the model isn't just guessing— it's making structured, contextual predictions. One of their most innovative developments is what they call Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This is a breakthrough in how they handle what are called the Key-Value indices, which are basically how individual tokens are represented in the attention mechanism within the Transformer architecture. Although this is getting a bit too advanced in technical terms, suffice it to say that these KV indices are some of the major uses of VRAM during the training and inference process, and part of the reason why you need to use thousands of GPUs at the same time to train these models— each GPU has a maximum of 96 gb of VRAM, and these indices eat that memory up for breakfast. Their MLA system finds a way to store a compressed version of these indices that captures the essential information while using far less memory. The brilliant part is this compression is built directly into how the model learns— it's not some separate step they need to do, it's built directly into the end-to-end training pipeline. This means that the entire mechanism is "differentiable" and able to be trained directly using the standard optimizers. All this stuff works because these models are ultimately finding much lower-dimensional representations of the underlying data than the so-called "ambient dimensions". So it's wasteful to store the full KV indices, even though that is basically what everyone else does. Not only do you end up wasting tons of space by storing way more numbers than you need, which gives a massive boost to the training memory footprint and efficiency (again, slashing the number of GPUs you need to train a world class model), but it can actually end up improving model quality because it can act like a "regularizer," forcing the model to pay attention to the truly important stuff instead of using the wasted capacity to fit to noise in the training data. So not only do you save a ton of memory, but the model might even perform better. At the very least, you don't get a massive hit to performance in exchange for the huge memory savings, which is generally the kind of tradeoff you are faced with in AI training. They also made major advances in GPU communication efficiency through their DualPipe algorithm and custom communication kernels. This system intelligently overlaps computation and communication, carefully balancing GPU resources between these tasks. They only need about 20 of their GPUs' streaming multiprocessors (SMs) for communication, leaving the rest free for computation. The result is much higher GPU utilization than typical training setups achieve. Another very smart thing they did is to use what is known as a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) Transformer architecture, but with key innovations around load balancing. As you might know, the size or capacity of an AI model is often measured in terms of the number of parameters the model contains. A parameter is just a number that stores some attribute of the model; either the "weight" or importance a particular artificial neuron has relative to another one, or the importance of a particular token depending on its context (in the "attention mechanism"), etc. Meta's latest Llama3 models come in a few sizes, for example: a 1 billion parameter version (the smallest), a 70B parameter model (the most commonly deployed one), and even a massive 405B parameter model. This largest model is of limited utility for most users because you would need to have tens of thousands of dollars worth of GPUs in your computer just to run at tolerable speeds for inference, at least if you deployed it in the naive full-precision version. Therefore most of the real-world usage and excitement surrounding these open source models is at the 8B parameter or highly quantized 70B parameter level, since that's what can fit in a consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPU, which you can buy now for under $1,000. So why does any of this matter? Well, in a sense, the parameter count and precision tells you something about how much raw information or data the model has stored internally. Note that I'm not talking about reasoning ability, or the model's "IQ" if you will: it turns out that models with even surprisingly modest parameter counts can show remarkable cognitive performance when it comes to solving complex logic problems, proving theorems in plane geometry, SAT math problems, etc. But those small models aren't going to be able to necessarily tell you every aspect of every plot twist in every single novel by Stendhal, whereas the really big models can potentially do that. The "cost" of that extreme level of knowledge is that the models become very unwieldy both to train and to do inference on, because you always need to store every single one of those 405B parameters (or whatever the parameter count is) in the GPU's VRAM at the same time in order to do any inference with the model. The beauty of the MOE model approach is that you can decompose the big model into a collection of smaller models that each know different, non-overlapping (at least fully) pieces of knowledge. DeepSeek's innovation here was developing what they call an "auxiliary-loss-free" load balancing strategy that maintains efficient expert utilization without the usual performance degradation that comes from load balancing. Then, depending on the nature of the inference request, you can intelligently route the inference to the "expert" models within that collection of smaller models that are most able to answer that question or solve that task. You can loosely think of it as being a committee of experts who have their own specialized knowledge domains: one might be a legal expert, the other a computer science expert, the other a business strategy expert. So if a question comes in about linear algebra, you don't give it to the legal expert. This is of course a very loose analogy and it doesn't actually work like this in practice. The real advantage of this approach is that it allows the model to contain a huge amount of knowledge without being very unwieldy, because even though the aggregate number of parameters is high across all the experts, only a small subset of these parameters is "active" at any given time, which means that you only need to store this small subset of weights in VRAM in order to do inference. In the case of DeepSeek-V3, they have an absolutely massive MOE model with 671B parameters, so it's much bigger than even the largest Llama3 model, but only 37B of these parameters are active at any given time— enough to fit in the VRAM of two consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPUs (under $2,000 total cost), rather than requiring one or more H100 GPUs which cost something like $40k each. It's rumored that both ChatGPT and Claude use an MoE architecture, with some leaks suggesting that GPT-4 had a total of 1.8 trillion parameters split across 8 models containing 220 billion parameters each. Despite that being a lot more doable than trying to fit all 1.8 trillion parameters in VRAM, it still requires multiple H100-grade GPUs just to run the model because of the massive amount of memory used. Beyond what has already been described, the technical papers mention several other key optimizations. These include their extremely memory-efficient training framework that avoids tensor parallelism, recomputes certain operations during backpropagation instead of storing them, and shares parameters between the main model and auxiliary prediction modules. The sum total of all these innovations, when layered together, has led to the ~45x efficiency improvement numbers that have been tossed around online, and I am perfectly willing to believe these are in the right ballpark. One very strong indicator that it's true is the cost of DeepSeek's API: despite this nearly best-in-class model performance, DeepSeek charges something like 95% less money for inference requests via its API than comparable models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In a sense, it's sort of like comparing Nvidia's GPUs to the new custom chips from competitors: even if they aren't quite as good, the value for money is so much better that it can still be a no-brainer depending on the application, as long as you can qualify the performance level and prove that it's good enough for your requirements and the API availability and latency is good enough (thus far, people have been amazed at how well DeepSeek's infrastructure has held up despite the truly incredible surge of demand owing to the performance of these new models). But unlike the case of Nvidia, where the cost differential is the result of them earning monopoly gross margins of 90%+ on their data-center products, the cost differential of the DeepSeek API relative to the OpenAI and Anthropic API could be simply that they are nearly 50x more compute efficient (it might even be significantly more than that on the inference side— the ~45x efficiency was on the training side). Indeed, it's not even clear that OpenAI and Anthropic are making great margins on their API services— they might be more interested in revenue growth and gathering more data from analyzing all the API requests they receive. Before moving on, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that many people are speculating that DeepSeek is simply lying about the number of GPUs and GPU hours spent training these models because they actually possess far more H100s than they are supposed to have given the export restrictions on these cards, and they don't want to cause trouble for themselves or hurt their chances of acquiring more of these cards. While it's certainly possible, I think it's more likely that they are telling the truth, and that they have simply been able to achieve these incredible results by being extremely clever and creative in their approach to training and inference. They explain how they are doing things, and I suspect that it's only a matter of time before their results are widely replicated and confirmed by other researchers at various other labs. The newer R1 model and technical report might even be even more mind blowing, since they were able to beat Anthropic to Chain-of-thought and now are basically the only ones besides OpenAI who have made this technology work at scale. But note that the O1 preview model was only released by OpenAI in mid-September of 2024. That's only ~4 months ago! Something you absolutely must keep in mind is that, unlike OpenAI, which is incredibly secretive about how these models really work at a low level, and won't release the actual model weights to anyone besides partners like Microsoft and other who sign heavy-duty NDAs, these DeepSeek models are both completely open-source and permissively licensed. They have released extremely detailed technical reports explaining how they work, as well as the code that anyone can look at and try to copy. With R1, DeepSeek essentially cracked one of the holy grails of AI: getting models to reason step-by-step without relying on massive supervised datasets. Their DeepSeek-R1-Zero experiment showed something remarkable: using pure reinforcement learning with carefully crafted reward functions, they managed to get models to develop sophisticated reasoning capabilities completely autonomously. This wasn't just about solving problems— the model organically learned to generate long chains of thought, self-verify its work, and allocate more computation time to harder problems. The technical breakthrough here was their novel approach to reward modeling. Rather than using complex neural reward models that can lead to "reward hacking" (where the model finds bogus ways to boost their rewards that don't actually lead to better real-world model performance), they developed a clever rule-based system that combines accuracy rewards (verifying final answers) with format rewards (encouraging structured thinking). This simpler approach turned out to be more robust and scalable than the process-based reward models that others have tried. What's particularly fascinating is that during training, they observed what they called an "aha moment," a phase where the model spontaneously learned to revise its thinking process mid-stream when encountering uncertainty. This emergent behavior wasn't explicitly programmed; it arose naturally from the interaction between the model and the reinforcement learning environment. The model would literally stop itself, flag potential issues in its reasoning, and restart with a different approach, all without being explicitly trained to do this. The full R1 model built on these insights by introducing what they call "cold-start" data— a small set of high-quality examples— before applying their RL techniques. They also solved one of the major challenges in reasoning models: language consistency. Previous attempts at chain-of-thought reasoning often resulted in models mixing languages or producing incoherent outputs. DeepSeek solved this through a clever language consistency reward during RL training, trading off a small performance hit for much more readable and consistent outputs. The results are mind-boggling: on AIME 2024, one of the most challenging high school math competitions, R1 achieved 79.8% accuracy, matching OpenAI's O1 model. On MATH-500, it hit 97.3%, and it achieved the 96.3 percentile on Codeforces programming competitions. But perhaps most impressively, they managed to distill these capabilities down to much smaller models: their 14B parameter version outperforms many models several times its size, suggesting that reasoning ability isn't just about raw parameter count but about how you train the model to process information. The recent scuttlebutt on Twitter and Blind (a corporate rumor website) is that these models caught Meta completely off guard and that they perform better than the new Llama4 models which are still being trained. Apparently, the Llama project within Meta has attracted a lot of attention internally from high-ranking technical executives, and as a result they have something like 13 individuals working on the Llama stuff who each individually earn more per year in total compensation than the combined training cost for the DeepSeek-V3 models which outperform it. How do you explain that to Zuck with a straight face? How does Zuck keep smiling while shoveling multiple billions of dollars to Nvidia to buy 100k H100s when a better model was trained using just 2k H100s for a bit over $5mm? But you better believe that Meta and every other big AI lab is taking these DeepSeek models apart, studying every word in those technical reports and every line of the open source code they released, trying desperately to integrate these same tricks and optimizations into their own training and inference pipelines. So what's the impact of all that? Well, naively it sort of seems like the aggregate demand for training and inference compute should be divided by some big number. Maybe not by 45, but maybe by 25 or even 30? Because whatever you thought you needed before these model releases, it's now a lot less. Now, an optimist might say "You are talking about a mere constant of proportionality, a single multiple. When you're dealing with an exponential growth curve, that stuff gets washed out so quickly that it doesn't end up matter all that much." And there is some truth to that: if AI really is as transformational as I expect, if the real-world utility of this tech is measured in the trillions, if inference-time compute is the new scaling law of the land, if we are going to have armies of humanoid robots running around doing massive amounts of inference constantly, then maybe the growth curve is still so steep and extreme, and Nvidia has a big enough lead, that it will still work out. But Nvidia is pricing in a LOT of good news in the coming years for that valuation to make sense, and when you start layering all these things together into a total mosaic, it starts to make me at least feel extremely uneasy about spending ~20x the 2025 estimated sales for their shares. What happens if you even see a slight moderation in sales growth? What if it turns out to be 85% instead of over 100%? What if gross margins come in a bit from 75% to 70%— still ridiculously high for a semiconductor company? At a high level, NVIDIA faces an unprecedented convergence of competitive threats that make its premium valuation increasingly difficult to justify at 20x forward sales and 75% gross margins. The company's supposed moats in hardware, software, and efficiency are all showing concerning cracks. The whole world— thousands of the smartest people on the planet, backed by untold billions of dollars of capital resources— are trying to assail them from every angle. On the hardware front, innovative architectures from Cerebras and Groq demonstrate that NVIDIA's interconnect advantage— a cornerstone of its data center dominance— can be circumvented through radical redesigns. Cerebras' wafer-scale chips and Groq's deterministic compute approach deliver compelling performance without needing NVIDIA's complex interconnect solutions. More traditionally, every major NVIDIA customer (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple) is developing custom silicon that could chip away at high-margin data center revenue. These aren't experimental projects anymore— Amazon alone is building out massive infrastructure with over 400,000 custom chips for Anthropic. The software moat appears equally vulnerable. New high-level frameworks like MLX, Triton, and JAX are abstracting away CUDA's importance, while efforts to improve AMD drivers could unlock much cheaper hardware alternatives. The trend toward higher-level abstractions mirrors how assembly language gave way to C/C++, suggesting CUDA's dominance may be more temporary than assumed. Most importantly, we're seeing the emergence of LLM-powered code translation that could automatically port CUDA code to run on any hardware target, potentially eliminating one of NVIDIA's strongest lock-in effects. Perhaps most devastating is DeepSeek's recent efficiency breakthrough, achieving comparable model performance at approximately 1/45th the compute cost. This suggests the entire industry has been massively over-provisioning compute resources. Combined with the emergence of more efficient inference architectures through chain-of-thought models, the aggregate demand for compute could be significantly lower than current projections assume. The economics here are compelling: when DeepSeek can match GPT-4 level performance while charging 95% less for API calls, it suggests either NVIDIA's customers are burning cash unnecessarily or margins must come down dramatically. The fact that TSMC will manufacture competitive chips for any well-funded customer puts a natural ceiling on NVIDIA's architectural advantages. But more fundamentally, history shows that markets eventually find a way around artificial bottlenecks that generate super-normal profits. When layered together, these threats suggest NVIDIA faces a much rockier path to maintaining its current growth trajectory and margins than its valuation implies. With five distinct vectors of attack— architectural innovation, customer vertical integration, software abstraction, efficiency breakthroughs, and manufacturing democratization— the probability that at least one succeeds in meaningfully impacting NVIDIA's margins or growth rate seems high. At current valuations, the market isn't pricing in any of these risks. I hope you enjoyed reading this article.

Jeffrey Emanuel January 25, 2025 60 min read As someone who spent ~10 years working as a generalist investment analyst at various long/short hedge funds (including stints at Millennium and Balyasny), while also being something of a math and computer nerd who has been studying deep learning since 2010 (back when Geoff Hinton was still talking about Restricted Boltzmann Machines and everything was still programmed using MATLAB, and researchers were still trying to show that they could get better results at classifying handwritten digits than by using Support Vector Machines), I'd like to think that I have a fairly unusual perspective on how AI technology is developing and how this relates to equity valuations in the stock market. For the past few years, I have been working more as a developer, and have several popular open-source projects for working with various forms of AI models/services (e.g., see LLM Aided OCR, Swiss Army Llama, Fast Vector Similarity, Source to Prompt, and Pastel Inference Layer for a few recent examples). Basically, I am using these frontier models all day, every day, in about as intense a way as possible. I have 3 Claude accounts so I don't run out of requests, and signed up for ChatGPT Pro within minutes of it being available. I also try to keep on top of the latest research advances, and carefully read all the major technical report papers that come out from the major AI labs. So I think I have a pretty good read on the space and how things are developing. At the same time, I've shorted a ton of stocks in my life and have won the best idea prize on the Value Investors Club twice (for TMS long and PDH short if you're keeping track at home). I say this not to brag, but rather to help establish my bona fides as someone who could opine on the subject without coming across as hopelessly naive to either technologists or professional investors. And while there are surely many people who know the math/science better, and people who are better at long/short investing in the stock market than me, I doubt there are very many who are in the middle of the Venn diagram to the extent I can claim to be. With all that said, whenever I meet with and chat with my friends and ex colleagues from the hedge fund world, the conversation quickly turns to Nvidia. It's not every day that a company goes from relative obscurity to being worth more than the combined stock markets of England, France, or Germany! And naturally, these friends want to know my thoughts on the subject. Because I am such a dyed-in-the-wool believer in the long term transformative impact of this technology— I truly believe it's going to radically change nearly every aspect of our economy and society in the next 5-10 years, with basically no historical precedent— it has been hard for me to make the argument that Nvidia's momentum is going to slow down or stop anytime soon. But even though I've thought the valuation was just too rich for my blood for the past year or so, a confluence of recent developments has caused me to flip a bit to my usual instinct, which is to be a bit more contrarian in outlook and to question the consensus when it seems to be more than priced in. The saying "what the wise man believes in the beginning, the fool believes in the end" became famous for a good reason. Before we get into the developments that give me pause, let's pause to briefly review the bull case for NVDA shares, which is basically now known by everyone and his brother. Deep learning and AI are the most transformative technologies since the internet, and poised to change basically everything in our society. Nvidia has somehow ended up with something close to a monopoly in terms of the share of aggregate industry capex that is spent on training and inference infrastructure. Some of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, etc., have all decided that they must do and spend whatever it takes to stay competitive in this space because they simply cannot afford to be left behind. The amount of capex dollars, gigawatts of electricity used, square footage of new-build data centers, and, of course, the number of GPUs, has absolutely exploded and seems to show no sign of slowing down. And Nvidia is able to earn insanely high 90%+ gross margins on the most high-end, datacenter oriented products. We've just scratched the surface here of the bull case. There are many additional aspects to it now, which have made even people who were already very bullish to become incrementally more bullish. Besides things like the rise of humanoid robots, which I suspect is going to take most people by surprise when they are rapidly able to perform a huge number of tasks that currently require an unskilled (or even skilled) human worker (e.g., doing laundry, cleaning, organizing, and cooking; doing construction work like renovating a bathroom or building a house in a team of workers; running a warehouse and driving forklifts, etc.), there are other factors which most people haven't even considered. One major thing that you hear the smart crowd talking about is the rise of "a new scaling law," which has created a new paradigm thinking about how compute needs will increase over time. The original scaling law, which is what has been driving progress in AI since AlexNet appeared in 2012 and the Transformer architecture was invented in 2017, is the pre-training scaling law: that the more billions (and now trillions) worth of tokens we can use as training data, and the larger the parameter count of the models we are training, and the more FLOPS of compute that we expend on training those models on those tokens, the better the performance of the resulting models on a large variety of highly useful downstream tasks. Not only that, but this improvement is somewhat knowable, to the point where the leading AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic have a pretty good idea of just how good their latest models would be even before they started the actual training runs— in some cases, predicting the benchmarks of the final models to within a couple percentage points. This "original scaling law" has been vitally important, but always caused some doubts in the minds of people projecting the future with it. For one thing, we seem to have already exhausted the world's accumulated set of high quality training data. Of course, that's not literally true— there are still so many old books and periodicals that haven't yet been properly digitized, and even if they have, are not properly licensed for use as training data. The problem is that, even if you give credit for all that stuff— say the sum total of "professionally" produced English language written content from the year 1500 to, say, the year 2000, it's not such a tremendous amount in percentage terms when you're talking about a training corpus of nearly 15 trillion tokens, which is the scale of current frontier models. For a quick reality check of those numbers: Google Books has digitized around 40mm books so far; if a typical book has 50k to 100k words, or 65k to 130k tokens, then that's between 2.6T and 5.2T tokens just from books, though surely a large chunk of that is already included in the training corpora used by the big labs, whether it's strictly legal or not. And there are lots of academic papers, with the arXiv website alone having over 2mm papers. And the Library of Congress has over 3 billion digitized newspaper pages. Taken together, that could be as much as 7T tokens in total, but since much of this is in fact included in training corpora, the remaining "incremental" training data probably isn't all that significant in the grand scheme of things. Of course, there are other ways to gather more training data. You could automatically transcribe every single YouTube video for example, and use that text. And while that might be helpful on the margin, it's certainly of much lower quality than, say, a highly respected textbook on Organic Chemistry as a source of useful knowledge about the world. So we've always had a looming "data wall" when it comes to the original scaling law; although we know we can keep shoveling more and more capex into GPUs and building more and more data centers, it's a lot harder to mass produce useful new human knowledge which is correct and incremental to what is already out there. Now, one intriguing response to this has been the rise of "synthetic data," which is text that is itself the output of an LLM. And while this seems almost nonsensical that it would work to "get high on your own supply" as a way of improving model quality, it actually seems to work very well in practice, at least in the domain of math, logic, and computer programming. The reason, of course, is that these are areas where we can mechanically check and prove the correctness of things. So we can sample from the vast universe of possible math theorems or possible Python scripts, and then actually check if they are correct, and only include them in our corpus if they are. And in this way, we can very dramatically expand our collection of high quality training data, at least in these kinds of areas. And then there are all the other kinds of data we could be training AI on besides text. For example, what if we take the entire whole genome sequencing (around 200 GB to 300 GB uncompressed for a single human being) for 100 million people? That's a lot of data obviously, although the vast majority of it would be nearly identical between any two people. Of course, this could be misleading to compare to textual data from books and the internet for various reasons: But it's still another large source of diverse information that we could train huge models on in the future, which is why I included it. So while there is some hope in terms of being able to capture more and more additional training data, if you look at the rate at which training corpora have grown in recent years, it quickly becomes obvious that we are close to hitting a wall in terms of data availability for "generally useful" knowledge that can get us closer to the ultimate goal of getting artificial super-intelligence which is 10x smarter than John von Neumann and is an absolute world-class expert on every specialty known to man. Besides the limited amount of available data, there have always been a couple other things that have lurked in the back of the mind of proponents of the pre-training scaling law. A big one of these is, after you've finished training the model, what are you supposed to do with all that compute infrastructure? Train the next model? Sure, you can do that, but given the rapid improvement in GPU speed and capacity, and the importance of electricity and other opex in the economic calculations, does it even really make sense to use your 2 year old cluster to train your new model? Surely you'd rather use the brand new data center you just built that costs 10x the old data center and is 20x more powerful because of better technology. The problem is, at some point you do need to amortize the up-front cost of these investments and recoup it with a stream of (hopefully positive) operating profit, right? The market is so excited about AI that it has thankfully ignored this, allowing companies like OpenAI to post breathtaking from-inception, cumulative operating losses while garnering increasingly eye-popping valuations in follow-up investment rounds (although, to their credit, they have also been able to demonstrate very fast growing revenues). But eventually, for this situation to be sustainable over a full market cycle, these data center costs do need to eventually be recouped, hopefully with a profit, which over time is competitive with other investment opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis. OK, so that was the pre-training scaling law. What's this "new" scaling law? Well, that's something that people really just started focusing on in the past year: inference time compute scaling. Before, the vast majority of all the compute you'd expend in the process was the up-front training compute to create the model in the first place. Once you had the trained model, performing inference on that model— i.e., asking a question or having the LLM perform some kind of task for you— used a certain, limited amount of compute. Critically, the total amount of inference compute (measured in various ways, such as FLOPS, in GPU memory footprint, etc.) was much, much less than what was required for the pre-training phase. Of course, the amount of inference compute does flex up when you increase the context window size of the models and the amount of output that you generate from them in one go (although researchers have made breathtaking algorithmic improvements on this front relative to the initial quadratic scaling people originally expected in scaling this up). But essentially, until recently, inference compute was generally a lot less intensive than training compute, and scaled basically linearly with the number of requests you are handling— the more demand for text completions from ChatGPT, for instance, the more inference compute you used up. With the advent of the revolutionary Chain-of-Thought ("COT") models introduced in the past year, most noticeably in OpenAI's flagship O1 model (but very recently in DeepSeek's new R1 model, which we will talk about later in much more detail), all that changed. Instead of the amount of inference compute being directly proportional to the length of the output text generated by the model (scaling up for larger context windows, model size, etc.), these new COT models also generate intermediate "logic tokens"; think of this as a sort of scratchpad or "internal monologue" of the model while it's trying to solve your problem or complete its assigned task. This represents a true sea change in how inference compute works: now, the more tokens you use for this internal chain of thought process, the better the quality of the final output you can provide the user. In effect, it's like giving a human worker more time and resources to accomplish a task, so they can double and triple check their work, do the same basic task in multiple different ways and verify that they come out the same way; take the result they came up with and "plug it in" to the formula to check that it actually does solve the equation, etc. It turns out that this approach works almost amazingly well; it is essentially leveraging the long anticipated power of what is called "reinforcement learning" with the power of the Transformer architecture. It directly addresses the single biggest weakness of the otherwise phenomenally successful Transformer model, which is its propensity to "hallucinate". Basically, the way Transformers work in terms of predicting the next token at each step is that, if they start out on a bad "path" in their initial response, they become almost like a prevaricating child who tries to spin a yarn about why they are actually correct, even if they should have realized mid-stream using common sense that what they are saying couldn't possibly be correct. Because the models are always seeking to be internally consistent and to have each successive generated token flow naturally from the preceding tokens and context, it's very hard for them to course-correct and backtrack. By breaking the inference process into what is effectively many intermediate stages, they can try lots of different things and see what's working and keep trying to course-correct and try other approaches until they can reach a fairly high threshold of confidence that they aren't talking nonsense. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this approach, beyond the fact that it works at all, is that the more logic/COT tokens you use, the better it works. Suddenly, you now have an additional dial you can turn so that, as you increase the amount of COT reasoning tokens (which uses a lot more inference compute, both in terms of FLOPS and memory), the higher the probability is that you will give a correct response— code that runs the first time without errors, or a solution to a logic problem without an obviously wrong deductive step. I can tell you from a lot of firsthand experience that, as good as Anthropic's Claude3.5 Sonnet model is at Python programming— and it is indeed VERY good— whenever you need to generate anything long and complicated, it invariably ends up making one or more stupid mistakes. Now, these mistakes are usually pretty easy to fix, and in fact you can normally fix them by simply feeding the errors generated by the Python interpreter, without any further explanation, as a follow-up inference prompt (or, more usefully, paste in the complete set of detected "problems" found in the code by your code editor, using what something called a Linter), it was still an annoying additional step. And when the code becomes very long or very complicated, it can sometimes take a lot longer to fix, and might even require some manual debugging by hand. The first time I tried the O1 model from OpenAI was like a revelation: I was amazed how often the code would be perfect the very first time. And that's because the COT process automatically finds and fixes problems before they ever make it to a final response token in the answer the model gives you. In fact, the O1 model used in OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus subscription for $20/month is basically the same model as the one used in the O1-Pro model featured in their new ChatGPT Pro subscription for 10x the price ($200/month, which raised plenty of eyebrows in the developer community); the main difference is that O1-Pro thinks for a lot longer before responding, generating vastly more COT logic tokens, and consuming a far larger amount of inference compute for every response. This is quite striking in that, even a very long and complex prompt for Claude3.5 Sonnet or GPT4o, with ~400kb+ of context given, generally takes less than 10 seconds to begin responding, and often less than 5 seconds. Whereas that same prompt to O1-Pro could easily take 5+ MINUTES before you get a response (although OpenAI does show you some of the "reasoning steps" that are generated during the process while you wait; critically, OpenAI has decided, presumably for trade secret related reasons,to hide from you the exact reasoning tokens it generates, showing you instead a highly abbreviated summary of these). As you can probably imagine, there are tons of contexts where accuracy is paramount— where you'd rather give up and tell the user you can't do it at all rather than give an answer that could be trivially proven wrong or which involves hallucinated facts or otherwise specious reasoning. Anything involving money/transactions, medical stuff, legal stuff, just to name a few. Basically, wherever the cost of inference is trivial relative to the hourly all-in compensation of the human knowledge worker who is interacting with the AI system, that's a case where it become a complete no-brainer to dial up the COT compute (the major drawback is that it increases the latency of responses by a lot, so there are still some contexts where you might prefer to iterate faster by getting lower latency responses that are less accurate or correct). Some of the most exciting news in the AI world came out just a few weeks ago and concerned OpenAI's new unreleased O3 model, which was able to solve a large variety of tasks that were previously deemed to be out of reach of current AI approaches in the near term. And the way it was able to do these hardest problems (which include exceptionally tough "foundational" math problems that would be very hard for even highly skilled professional mathematicians to solve), is that OpenAI threw insane amount of compute resources at the problems— in some cases, spending $3k+ worth of compute power to solve a single task (compare this to traditional inference costs for a single task, which would be unlikely to exceed a couple dollars using regular Transformer models without chain-of-thought). It doesn't take an AI genius to realize that this development creates a new scaling law that is totally independent of the original pre-training scaling law. Now, you still want to train the best model you can by cleverly leveraging as much compute as you can and as many trillion tokens of high quality training data as possible, but that's just the beginning of the story in this new world; now, you could easily use incredibly huge amounts of compute just to do inference from these models at a very high level of confidence or when trying to solve extremely tough problems that require "genius level" reasoning to avoid all the potential pitfalls that would lead a regular LLM astray. Even if you believe, as I do, that the future prospects for AI are almost unimaginably bright, the question still remains, "Why should one company extract the majority of the profit pool from this technology?" There are certainly many historical cases where a very important new technology changed the world, but the main winners were not the companies that seemed the most promising during the initial stages of the process. The Wright Brothers' airplane company in all its current incarnations across many different firms today isn't worth more than $10b despite them inventing and perfecting the technology well ahead of everyone else. And while Ford has a respectable market cap of $40b today, it's just 1.1% of Nvidia's current market cap. To understand this, it's important to really understand why Nvidia is currently capturing so much of the pie today. After all, they aren't the only company that even makes GPUs. AMD makes respectable GPUs that, on paper, have comparable numbers of transistors, which are made using similar process nodes, etc. Sure, they aren't as fast or as advanced as Nvidia's GPUs, but it's not like the Nvidia GPUs are 10x faster or anything like that. In fact, in terms of naive/raw dollars per FLOP, AMD GPUs are something like half the price of Nvidia GPUs. Looking at other semiconductor markets such as the DRAM market, despite the fact that it is also very highly consolidated with only 3 meaningful global players (Samsung, Micron, SK-Hynix), gross margins in the DRAM market range from negative at the bottom of the cycle to ~60% at the very top of the cycle, with an average in the 20% range. Compare that to Nvidia's overall gross margin in recent quarters of ~75%, which is dragged down by the lower-margin and more commoditized consumer 3D graphics category. So how is this possible? Well, the main reasons have to do with software— better drivers that "just work" on Linux and which are highly battle-tested and reliable (unlike AMD, which is notorious for the low quality and instability of their Linux drivers), and highly optimized open-source code in popular libraries such as PyTorch that has been tuned to work really well on Nvidia GPUs. It goes beyond that though— the very programming framework that coders use to write low-level code that is optimized for GPUs, CUDA, is totally proprietary to Nvidia, and it has become a de facto standard. If you want to hire a bunch of extremely talented programmers who know how to make things go really fast on GPUs, and pay them $650k/year or whatever the going rate is for people with that particular expertise, chances are that they are going to "think" and work in CUDA. Besides software superiority, the other major thing that Nvidia has going for it is what is known as interconnect— essentially, the bandwidth that connects together thousands of GPUs together efficiently so they can be jointly harnessed to train today's leading-edge foundational models. In short, the key to efficient training is to keep all the GPUs as fully utilized as possible all the time— not waiting around idling until they receive the next chunk of data they need to compute the next step of the training process. The bandwidth requirements are extremely high— much, much higher than the typical bandwidth that is needed in traditional data center use cases. You can't really use traditional networking gear or fiber optics for this kind of interconnect, since it would introduce too much latency and wouldn't give you the pure terabytes per second of bandwidth that is needed to keep all the GPUs constantly busy. Nvidia made an incredibly smart decision to purchase the Israeli company Mellanox back in 2019 for a mere $6.9b, and this acquisition is what provided them with their industry leading interconnect technology. Note that interconnect speed is a lot more relevant to the training process, where you have to harness together the output of thousands of GPUs at the same time, than the inference process (including COT inference), which can use just a handful of GPUs— all you need is enough VRAM to store the quantized (compressed) model weights of the already-trained model. So those are arguably the major components of Nvidia's "moat" and how it has been able to maintain such high margins for so long (there is also a "flywheel" aspect to things, where they aggressively invest their super-normal profits into tons of R&D, which in turn helps them improve their tech at a faster rate than the competition, so they are always in the lead in terms of raw performance). But as was pointed out earlier, what customers really tend to care about, all other things being equal, is performance per dollar (both in up-front capex cost of equipment and in energy usage, so performance per watt), and even though Nvidia's GPUs are certainly the fastest, they are not the best price/performance when measured naively in terms of FLOPS. But the thing is, all other things are NOT equal, and the fact that AMD's drivers suck, that popular AI software libraries don't run as well on AMD GPUs, that you can't find really good GPU experts who specialize in AMD GPUs outside of the gaming world (why would they bother when there is more demand in the market for CUDA experts?), that you can't wire thousands of them together as effectively because of lousy interconnect technology for AMD— all this means that AMD is basically not competitive in the high-end data center world, and doesn't seem to have very good prospects for getting there in the near term. Well, that all sounds very bullish for Nvidia, right? Now you can see why the stock is trading at such a huge valuation! But what are the other clouds on the horizon? Well, there are few that I think merit significant attention. Some have been lurking in the background for the last few years, but too small to make a dent considering how quickly the pie has been growing, but where they are getting ready to potentially inflect upwards. Others are very recent developments (as in, the last 2 weeks) that might dramatically change the near-term trajectory of incremental GPU demand. At a very high level, you can think of things like this: Nvidia operated in a pretty niche area for a very long time; they had very limited competition, and the competition wasn't particular profitable or growing fast enough to ever pose a real threat, since they didn't have the capital needed to really apply pressure to a market leader like Nvidia. The gaming market was large and growing, but didn't feature earth shattering margins or particularly fabulous year over year growth rates. A few big tech companies started ramping up hiring and spending on machine learning and AI efforts around 2016-2017, but it was never a truly significant line item for any of them on an aggregate basis— more of a "moonshot" R&D expenditure. But once the big AI race started in earnest with the release of ChatGPT in 2022— only a bit over 2 years ago, although it seems like a lifetime ago in terms of developments— that situation changed very dramatically. Suddenly, big companies were ready to spend many, many billions of dollars incredibly quickly. The number of researchers showing up at the big research conferences like Neurips and ICML went up very, very dramatically. All the smart students who might have previously studied financial derivatives were instead studying Transformers, and $1mm+ compensation packages for non-executive engineering roles (i.e., for independent contributors not managing a team) became the norm at the leading AI labs. It takes a while to change the direction of a massive cruise ship; and even if you move really quickly and spend billions, it takes a year or more to build greenfield data centers and order all the equipment (with ballooning lead times) and get it all set up and working. It takes a long time to hire and onboard even smart coders before they can really hit their stride and familiarize themselves with the existing codebases and infrastructure. But now, you can imagine that absolutely biblical amounts of capital, brainpower, and effort are being expended in this area. And Nvidia has the biggest target of any player on their back, because they are the ones who are making the lion's share of the profits TODAY, not in some hypothetical future where the AI runs our whole lives. So the very high level takeaway is basically that "markets find a way"; they find alternative, radically innovative new approaches to building hardware that leverage completely new ideas to sidestep barriers that help prop up Nvidia's moat. For example, so-called "wafer scale" AI training chips from Cerebras, which dedicate an entire 300mm silicon wafer to an absolutely gargantuan chip that contains orders of magnitude more transistors and cores on a single chip (see this recent blog post from them explaining how they were able to solve the "yield problem" that had been preventing this approach from being economically practical in the past). To put this into perspective, if you compare Cerebras' newest WSE-3 chip to Nvidia's flagship data-center GPU, the H100, the Cerebras chip has a total die area of 46,225 square millimeters compared to just 814 for the H100 (and the H100 is itself considered an enormous chip by industry standards); that's a multiple of ~57x! And instead of having 132 "streaming multiprocessor" cores enabled on the chip like the H100 has, the Cerebras chip has ~900,000 cores (granted, each of these cores is smaller and does a lot less, but it's still an almost unfathomably large number in comparison). In more concrete apples-to-apples terms, the Cerebras chip can do around ~32x the FLOPS in AI contexts as a single H100 chip. Since an H100 sells for close to $40k a pop, you can imagine that the WSE-3 chip isn't cheap. So why does this all matter? Well, instead of trying to battle Nvidia head-on by using a similar approach and trying to match the Mellanox interconnect technology, Cerebras has used a radically innovative approach to do an end-run around the interconnect problem: inter-processor bandwidth becomes much less of an issue when everything is running on the same super-sized chip. You don't even need to have the same level of interconnect because one mega chip replaces tons of H100s. And the Cerebras chips also work extremely well for AI inference tasks. In fact, you can try it today for free here and use Meta's very respectable Llama-3.3-70B model. It responds basically instantaneously, at ~1,500 tokens per second. To put that into perspective, anything above 30 tokens per second feels relatively snappy to users based on comparisons to ChatGPT and Claude, and even 10 tokens per second is fast enough that you can basically read the response while it's being generated. Cerebras is also not alone; there are other companies, like Groq (not to be confused with the Grok model family trained by Elon Musk's X AI). Groq has taken yet another innovative approach to solving the same fundamental problem. Instead of trying to compete with Nvidia's CUDA software stack directly, they've developed what they call a "tensor processing unit" (TPU) that is specifically designed for the exact mathematical operations that deep learning models need to perform. Their chips are designed around a concept called "deterministic compute," which means that, unlike traditional GPUs where the exact timing of operations can vary, their chips execute operations in a completely predictable way every single time. This might sound like a minor technical detail, but it actually makes a massive difference for both chip design and software development. Because the timing is completely deterministic, Groq can optimize their chips in ways that would be impossible with traditional GPU architectures. As a result, they've been demonstrating for the past 6+ months inference speeds of over 500 tokens per second with the Llama series of models and other open source models, far exceeding what's possible with traditional GPU setups. Like Cerebras, this is available today and you can try it for free here. Using a comparable Llama3 model with "speculative decoding," Groq is able to generate 1,320 tokens per second, on par with Cerebras and far in excess of what is possible using regular GPUs. Now, you might ask what the point is of achieving 1,000+ tokens per second when users seem pretty satisfied with ChatGPT, which is operating at less than 10% of that speed. And the thing is, it does matter. It makes it a lot faster to iterate and not lose focus as a human knowledge worker when you get instant feedback. And if you're using the model programmatically via the API, which is increasingly where much of the demand is coming from, then it can enable whole new classes of applications that require multi-stage inference (where the output of previous stages is used as input in successive stages of prompting/inference) or which require low-latency responses, such as content moderation, fraud detection, dynamic pricing, etc. But even more fundamentally, the faster you can serve requests, the faster you can cycle things, and the busier you can keep the hardware. Although Groq's hardware is extremely expensive, clocking in at $2mm to $3mm for a single server, it ends up costing far less per request fulfilled if you have enough demand to keep the hardware busy all the time. And like Nvidia with CUDA, a huge part of Groq's advantage comes from their own proprietary software stack. They are able to take the same open source models that other companies like Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral develop and release for free, and decompose them in special ways that allow them to run dramatically faster on their specific hardware. Like Cerebras, they have taken different technical decisions to optimize certain particular aspects of the process, which allows them to do things in a fundamentally different way. In Groq's case, it's because they are entirely focused on inference level compute, not on training: all their special sauce hardware and software only give these huge speed and efficiency advantages when doing inference on an already trained model. But if the next big scaling law that people are excited about is for inference level compute— and if the biggest drawback of COT models is the high latency introduced by having to generate all those intermediate logic tokens before they can respond— then even a company that only does inference compute, but which does it dramatically faster and more efficiently than Nvidia can— can introduce a serious competitive threat in the coming years. At the very least, Cerebras and Groq can chip away at the lofty expectations for Nvidia's revenue growth over the next 2-3 years that are embedded in the current equity valuation. Besides these particularly innovative, if relatively unknown, startup competitors, there is some serious competition coming from some of Nvidia's biggest customers themselves who have been making custom silicon that specifically targets AI training and inference workloads. Perhaps the best known of these is Google, which has been developing its own proprietary TPUs since 2016. Interestingly, although it briefly sold TPUs to external customers, Google has been using all its TPUs internally for the past several years, and it is already on its 6th generation of TPU hardware. Amazon has also been developing its own custom chips called Trainium2 and Inferentia2. And while Amazon is building out data centers featuring billions of dollars of Nvidia GPUs, they are also at the same time investing many billions in other data centers that use these internal chips. They have one cluster that they are bringing online for Anthropic that features over 400k chips. Amazon gets a lot of flak for totally bungling their internal AI model development, squandering massive amounts of internal compute resources on models that ultimately are not competitive, but the custom silicon is another matter. Again, they don't necessarily need their chips to be better and faster than Nvidia's. What they need is for their chips to be good enough, but build them at a breakeven gross margin instead of the ~90%+ gross margin that Nvidia earns on its H100 business. OpenAI has also announced their plans to build custom chips, and they (together with Microsoft) are obviously the single largest user of Nvidia's data center hardware. As if that weren't enough, Microsoft have themselves announced their own custom chips! And Apple, the most valuable technology company in the world, has been blowing away expectations for years now with their highly innovative and disruptive custom silicon operation, which now completely trounces the CPUs from both Intel and AMD in terms of performance per watt, which is the most important factor in mobile (phone/tablet/laptop) applications. And they have been making their own internally designed GPUs and "Neural Processors" for years, even though they have yet to really demonstrate the utility of such chips outside of their own custom applications, like the advanced software based image processing used in the iPhone's camera. While Apple's focus seems somewhat orthogonal to these other players in terms of its mobile-first, consumer oriented, "edge compute" focus, if it ends up spending enough money on its new contract with OpenAI to provide AI services to iPhone users, you have to imagine that they have teams looking into making their own custom silicon for inference/training (although given their secrecy, you might never even know about it directly!). Now, it's no secret that there is a strong power law distribution of Nvidia's hyper-scaler customer base, with the top handful of customers representing the lion's share of high-margin revenue. How should one think about the future of this business when literally every single one of these VIP customers is building their own custom chips specifically for AI training and inference? When thinking about all this, you should keep one incredibly important thing in mind: Nvidia is largely an IP based company. They don't make their own chips. The true special sauce for making these incredible devices arguably comes more from TSMC, the actual fab, and ASML, which makes the special EUV lithography machines used by TSMC to make these leading-edge process node chips. And that's critically important, because TSMC will sell their most advanced chips to anyone who comes to them with enough up-front investment and is willing to guarantee a certain amount of volume. They don't care if it's for Bitcoin mining ASICs, GPUs, TPUs, mobile phone SoCs, etc. As much as senior chip designers at Nvidia earn per year, surely some of the best of them could be lured away by these other tech behemoths for enough cash and stock. And once they have a team and resources, they can design innovative chips (again, perhaps not even 50% as advanced as an H100, but with that Nvidia gross margin, there is plenty of room to work with) in 2 to 3 years, and thanks for TSMC, they can turn those into actual silicon using the exact same process node technology as Nvidia. As if these looming hardware threats weren't bad enough, there are a few developments in the software world in the last couple years that, while they started out slowly, are now picking up real steam and could pose a serious threat to the software dominance of Nvidia's CUDA. The first of these is the horrible Linux drivers for AMD GPUs. Remember we talked about how AMD has inexplicably allowed these drivers to suck for years despite leaving massive amounts of money on the table? Well, amusingly enough, the infamous hacker George Hotz (famous for jailbreaking the original iphone as a teenager, and currently the CEO of self-driving startup Comma.ai and AI computer company Tiny Corp, which also makes the open-source tinygrad AI software framework), recently announced that he was sick and tired of dealing with AMD's bad drivers, and desperately wanted to be able to to leverage the lower cost AMD GPUs in their TinyBox AI computers (which come in multiple flavors, some of which use Nvidia GPUs, and some of which use AMD GPUS). Well, he is making his own custom drivers and software stack for AMD GPUs without any help from AMD themselves; on Jan. 15th of 2025, he tweeted via his company's X account that "We are one piece away from a completely sovereign stack on AMD, the RDNA3 assembler. We have our own driver, runtime, libraries, and emulator. (all in ~12,000 lines!)" Given his track record and skills, it is likely that they will have this all working in the next couple months, and this would allow for a lot of exciting possibilities of using AMD GPUs for all sorts of applications where companies currently feel compelled to pay up for Nvidia GPUs. OK, well that's just a driver for AMD, and it's not even done yet. What else is there? Well, there are a few other areas on the software side that are a lot more impactful. For one, there is now a massive concerted effort across many large tech companies and the open source software community at large to make more generic AI software frameworks that have CUDA as just one of many "compilation targets". That is, you write your software using higher-level abstractions, and the system itself can automatically turn those high-level constructs into super well-tuned low-level code that works extremely well on CUDA. But because it's done at this higher level of abstraction, it can just as easily get compiled into low-level code that works extremely well on lots of other GPUs and TPUs from a variety of providers, such as the massive number of custom chips in the pipeline from every big tech company. The most famous examples of these frameworks are MLX (sponsored primarily by Apple), Triton (sponsored primarily by OpenAI), and JAX (developed by Google). MLX is particularly interesting because it provides a PyTorch-like API that can run efficiently on Apple Silicon, showing how these abstraction layers can enable AI workloads to run on completely different architectures. Triton, meanwhile, has become increasingly popular as it allows developers to write high-performance code that can be compiled to run on various hardware targets without having to understand the low-level details of each platform. These frameworks allow developers to write their code once using high powered abstractions and then target tons of platforms automatically— doesn't that sound like a better way to do things, which would give you a lot more flexibility in terms of how you actually run the code? In the 1980s, all the most popular, best selling software was written in hand-tuned assembly language. The PKZIP compression utility for example was hand crafted to maximize speed, to the point where a competently coded version written in the standard C programming language and compiled using the best available optimizing compilers at the time, would run at probably half the speed of the hand-tuned assembly code. The same is true for other popular software packages like WordStar, VisiCalc, and so on. Over time, compilers kept getting better and better, and every time the CPU architectures changed (say, from Intel releasing the 486, then the Pentium, and so on), that hand-rolled assembler would often have to be thrown out and rewritten, something that only the smartest coders were capable of (sort of like how CUDA experts are on a different level in the job market versus a "regular" software developer). Eventually, things converged so that the speed benefits of hand-rolled assembly were outweighed dramatically by the flexibility of being able to write code in a high-level language like C or C++, where you rely on the compiler to make things run really optimally on the given CPU. Nowadays, very little new code is written in assembly. I believe a similar transformation will end up happening for AI training and inference code, for similar reasons: computers are good at optimization, and flexibility and speed of development is increasingly the more important factor— especially if it also allows you to save dramatically on your hardware bill because you don't need to keep paying the "CUDA tax" that gives Nvidia 90%+ margins. Yet another area where you might see things change dramatically is that CUDA might very well end up being more of a high level abstraction itself— a "specification language" similar to Verilog (used as the industry standard to describe chip layouts) that skilled developers can use to describe high-level algorithms that involve massive parallelism (since they are already familiar with it, it's very well constructed, it's the lingua franca, etc.), but then instead of having that code compiled for use on Nvidia GPUs like you would normally do, it can instead be fed as source code into an LLM which can port it into whatever low-level code is understood by the new Cerebras chip, or the new Amazon Trainium2, or the new Google TPUv6, etc. This isn't as far off as you might think; it's probably already well within reach using OpenAI's latest O3 model, and surely will be possible generally within a year or two. Perhaps the most shocking development which was alluded to earlier happened in the last couple of weeks. And that is the news that has totally rocked the AI world, and which has been dominating the discourse among knowledgeable people on Twitter despite its complete absence from any of the mainstream media outlets: that a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek released two new models that have basically world-competitive performance levels on par with the best models from OpenAI and Anthropic (blowing past the Meta Llama3 models and other smaller open source model players such as Mistral). These models are called DeepSeek-V3 (basically their answer to GPT-4o and Claude3.5 Sonnet) and DeepSeek-R1 (basically their answer to OpenAI's O1 model). Why is this all so shocking? Well, first of all, DeepSeek is a tiny Chinese company that reportedly has under 200 employees. The story goes that they started out as a quant trading hedge fund similar to TwoSigma or RenTec, but after Xi Jinping cracked down on that space, they used their math and engineering chops to pivot into AI research. Who knows if any of that is really true or if they are merely some kind of front for the CCP or the Chinese military. But the fact remains that they have released two incredibly detailed technical reports, for DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeekR1. These are heavy technical reports, and if you don't know a lot of linear algebra, you probably won't understand much. But what you should really try is to download the free DeepSeek app on the AppStore here and install it using a Google account to log in and give it a try (you can also install it on Android here), or simply try it out on your desktop computer in the browser here. Make sure to select the "DeepThink" option to enable chain-of-thought (the R1 model) and ask it to explain parts of the technical reports in simple terms. This will simultaneously show you a few important things: One, this model is absolutely legit. There is a lot of BS that goes on with AI benchmarks, which are routinely gamed so that models appear to perform great on the benchmarks but then suck in real world tests. Google is certainly the worst offender in this regard, constantly crowing about how amazing their LLMs are, when they are so awful in any real world test that they can't even reliably accomplish the simplest possible tasks, let alone challenging coding tasks. These DeepSeek models are not like that— the responses are coherent, compelling, and absolutely on the same level as those from OpenAI and Anthropic. Two, that DeepSeek has made profound advancements not just in model quality, but more importantly in model training and inference efficiency. By being extremely close to the hardware and by layering together a handful of distinct, very clever optimizations, DeepSeek was able to train these incredible models using GPUs in a dramatically more efficient way. By some measurements, over ~45x more efficiently than other leading-edge models. DeepSeek claims that the complete cost to train DeepSeek-V3 was just over $5mm. That is absolutely nothing by the standards of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., which were well into the $100mm+ level for training costs for a single model as early as 2024. How in the world could this be possible? How could this little Chinese company completely upstage all the smartest minds at our leading AI labs, which have 100 times more resources, headcount, payroll, capital, GPUs, etc? Wasn't China supposed to be crippled by Biden's restriction on GPU exports? Well, the details are fairly technical, but we can at least describe them at a high level. It might have just turned out that the relative GPU processing poverty of DeepSeek was the critical ingredient to make them more creative and clever, necessity being the mother of invention and all. A major innovation is their sophisticated mixed-precision training framework that lets them use 8-bit floating point numbers (FP8) throughout the entire training process. Most Western AI labs train using "full precision" 32-bit numbers (this basically specifies the number of gradations possible in describing the output of an artificial neuron; 8 bits in FP8 lets you store a much wider range of numbers than you might expect— it's not just limited to 256 different equal-sized magnitudes like you'd get with regular integers, but instead uses clever math tricks to store both very small and very large numbers— though naturally with less precision than you'd get with 32 bits.) The main tradeoff is that while FP32 can store numbers with incredible precision across an enormous range, FP8 sacrifices some of that precision to save memory and boost performance, while still maintaining enough accuracy for many AI workloads. DeepSeek cracked this problem by developing a clever system that breaks numbers into small tiles for activations and blocks for weights, and strategically uses high-precision calculations at key points in the network. Unlike other labs that train in high precision and then compress later (losing some quality in the process), DeepSeek's native FP8 approach means they get the massive memory savings without compromising performance. When you're training across thousands of GPUs, this dramatic reduction in memory requirements per GPU translates into needing far fewer GPUs overall. Another major breakthrough is their multi-token prediction system. Most Transformer based LLM models do inference by predicting the next token— one token at a time. DeepSeek figured out how to predict multiple tokens while maintaining the quality you'd get from single-token prediction. Their approach achieves about 85-90% accuracy on these additional token predictions, which effectively doubles inference speed without sacrificing much quality. The clever part is they maintain the complete causal chain of predictions, so the model isn't just guessing— it's making structured, contextual predictions. One of their most innovative developments is what they call Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This is a breakthrough in how they handle what are called the Key-Value indices, which are basically how individual tokens are represented in the attention mechanism within the Transformer architecture. Although this is getting a bit too advanced in technical terms, suffice it to say that these KV indices are some of the major uses of VRAM during the training and inference process, and part of the reason why you need to use thousands of GPUs at the same time to train these models— each GPU has a maximum of 96 gb of VRAM, and these indices eat that memory up for breakfast. Their MLA system finds a way to store a compressed version of these indices that captures the essential information while using far less memory. The brilliant part is this compression is built directly into how the model learns— it's not some separate step they need to do, it's built directly into the end-to-end training pipeline. This means that the entire mechanism is "differentiable" and able to be trained directly using the standard optimizers. All this stuff works because these models are ultimately finding much lower-dimensional representations of the underlying data than the so-called "ambient dimensions". So it's wasteful to store the full KV indices, even though that is basically what everyone else does. Not only do you end up wasting tons of space by storing way more numbers than you need, which gives a massive boost to the training memory footprint and efficiency (again, slashing the number of GPUs you need to train a world class model), but it can actually end up improving model quality because it can act like a "regularizer," forcing the model to pay attention to the truly important stuff instead of using the wasted capacity to fit to noise in the training data. So not only do you save a ton of memory, but the model might even perform better. At the very least, you don't get a massive hit to performance in exchange for the huge memory savings, which is generally the kind of tradeoff you are faced with in AI training. They also made major advances in GPU communication efficiency through their DualPipe algorithm and custom communication kernels. This system intelligently overlaps computation and communication, carefully balancing GPU resources between these tasks. They only need about 20 of their GPUs' streaming multiprocessors (SMs) for communication, leaving the rest free for computation. The result is much higher GPU utilization than typical training setups achieve. Another very smart thing they did is to use what is known as a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) Transformer architecture, but with key innovations around load balancing. As you might know, the size or capacity of an AI model is often measured in terms of the number of parameters the model contains. A parameter is just a number that stores some attribute of the model; either the "weight" or importance a particular artificial neuron has relative to another one, or the importance of a particular token depending on its context (in the "attention mechanism"), etc. Meta's latest Llama3 models come in a few sizes, for example: a 1 billion parameter version (the smallest), a 70B parameter model (the most commonly deployed one), and even a massive 405B parameter model. This largest model is of limited utility for most users because you would need to have tens of thousands of dollars worth of GPUs in your computer just to run at tolerable speeds for inference, at least if you deployed it in the naive full-precision version. Therefore most of the real-world usage and excitement surrounding these open source models is at the 8B parameter or highly quantized 70B parameter level, since that's what can fit in a consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPU, which you can buy now for under $1,000. So why does any of this matter? Well, in a sense, the parameter count and precision tells you something about how much raw information or data the model has stored internally. Note that I'm not talking about reasoning ability, or the model's "IQ" if you will: it turns out that models with even surprisingly modest parameter counts can show remarkable cognitive performance when it comes to solving complex logic problems, proving theorems in plane geometry, SAT math problems, etc. But those small models aren't going to be able to necessarily tell you every aspect of every plot twist in every single novel by Stendhal, whereas the really big models can potentially do that. The "cost" of that extreme level of knowledge is that the models become very unwieldy both to train and to do inference on, because you always need to store every single one of those 405B parameters (or whatever the parameter count is) in the GPU's VRAM at the same time in order to do any inference with the model. The beauty of the MOE model approach is that you can decompose the big model into a collection of smaller models that each know different, non-overlapping (at least fully) pieces of knowledge. DeepSeek's innovation here was developing what they call an "auxiliary-loss-free" load balancing strategy that maintains efficient expert utilization without the usual performance degradation that comes from load balancing. Then, depending on the nature of the inference request, you can intelligently route the inference to the "expert" models within that collection of smaller models that are most able to answer that question or solve that task. You can loosely think of it as being a committee of experts who have their own specialized knowledge domains: one might be a legal expert, the other a computer science expert, the other a business strategy expert. So if a question comes in about linear algebra, you don't give it to the legal expert. This is of course a very loose analogy and it doesn't actually work like this in practice. The real advantage of this approach is that it allows the model to contain a huge amount of knowledge without being very unwieldy, because even though the aggregate number of parameters is high across all the experts, only a small subset of these parameters is "active" at any given time, which means that you only need to store this small subset of weights in VRAM in order to do inference. In the case of DeepSeek-V3, they have an absolutely massive MOE model with 671B parameters, so it's much bigger than even the largest Llama3 model, but only 37B of these parameters are active at any given time— enough to fit in the VRAM of two consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPUs (under $2,000 total cost), rather than requiring one or more H100 GPUs which cost something like $40k each. It's rumored that both ChatGPT and Claude use an MoE architecture, with some leaks suggesting that GPT-4 had a total of 1.8 trillion parameters split across 8 models containing 220 billion parameters each. Despite that being a lot more doable than trying to fit all 1.8 trillion parameters in VRAM, it still requires multiple H100-grade GPUs just to run the model because of the massive amount of memory used. Beyond what has already been described, the technical papers mention several other key optimizations. These include their extremely memory-efficient training framework that avoids tensor parallelism, recomputes certain operations during backpropagation instead of storing them, and shares parameters between the main model and auxiliary prediction modules. The sum total of all these innovations, when layered together, has led to the ~45x efficiency improvement numbers that have been tossed around online, and I am perfectly willing to believe these are in the right ballpark. One very strong indicator that it's true is the cost of DeepSeek's API: despite this nearly best-in-class model performance, DeepSeek charges something like 95% less money for inference requests via its API than comparable models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In a sense, it's sort of like comparing Nvidia's GPUs to the new custom chips from competitors: even if they aren't quite as good, the value for money is so much better that it can still be a no-brainer depending on the application, as long as you can qualify the performance level and prove that it's good enough for your requirements and the API availability and latency is good enough (thus far, people have been amazed at how well DeepSeek's infrastructure has held up despite the truly incredible surge of demand owing to the performance of these new models). But unlike the case of Nvidia, where the cost differential is the result of them earning monopoly gross margins of 90%+ on their data-center products, the cost differential of the DeepSeek API relative to the OpenAI and Anthropic API could be simply that they are nearly 50x more compute efficient (it might even be significantly more than that on the inference side— the ~45x efficiency was on the training side). Indeed, it's not even clear that OpenAI and Anthropic are making great margins on their API services— they might be more interested in revenue growth and gathering more data from analyzing all the API requests they receive. Before moving on, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that many people are speculating that DeepSeek is simply lying about the number of GPUs and GPU hours spent training these models because they actually possess far more H100s than they are supposed to have given the export restrictions on these cards, and they don't want to cause trouble for themselves or hurt their chances of acquiring more of these cards. While it's certainly possible, I think it's more likely that they are telling the truth, and that they have simply been able to achieve these incredible results by being extremely clever and creative in their approach to training and inference. They explain how they are doing things, and I suspect that it's only a matter of time before their results are widely replicated and confirmed by other researchers at various other labs. The newer R1 model and technical report might even be even more mind blowing, since they were able to beat Anthropic to Chain-of-thought and now are basically the only ones besides OpenAI who have made this technology work at scale. But note that the O1 preview model was only released by OpenAI in mid-September of 2024. That's only ~4 months ago! Something you absolutely must keep in mind is that, unlike OpenAI, which is incredibly secretive about how these models really work at a low level, and won't release the actual model weights to anyone besides partners like Microsoft and other who sign heavy-duty NDAs, these DeepSeek models are both completely open-source and permissively licensed. They have released extremely detailed technical reports explaining how they work, as well as the code that anyone can look at and try to copy. With R1, DeepSeek essentially cracked one of the holy grails of AI: getting models to reason step-by-step without relying on massive supervised datasets. Their DeepSeek-R1-Zero experiment showed something remarkable: using pure reinforcement learning with carefully crafted reward functions, they managed to get models to develop sophisticated reasoning capabilities completely autonomously. This wasn't just about solving problems— the model organically learned to generate long chains of thought, self-verify its work, and allocate more computation time to harder problems. The technical breakthrough here was their novel approach to reward modeling. Rather than using complex neural reward models that can lead to "reward hacking" (where the model finds bogus ways to boost their rewards that don't actually lead to better real-world model performance), they developed a clever rule-based system that combines accuracy rewards (verifying final answers) with format rewards (encouraging structured thinking). This simpler approach turned out to be more robust and scalable than the process-based reward models that others have tried. What's particularly fascinating is that during training, they observed what they called an "aha moment," a phase where the model spontaneously learned to revise its thinking process mid-stream when encountering uncertainty. This emergent behavior wasn't explicitly programmed; it arose naturally from the interaction between the model and the reinforcement learning environment. The model would literally stop itself, flag potential issues in its reasoning, and restart with a different approach, all without being explicitly trained to do this. The full R1 model built on these insights by introducing what they call "cold-start" data— a small set of high-quality examples— before applying their RL techniques. They also solved one of the major challenges in reasoning models: language consistency. Previous attempts at chain-of-thought reasoning often resulted in models mixing languages or producing incoherent outputs. DeepSeek solved this through a clever language consistency reward during RL training, trading off a small performance hit for much more readable and consistent outputs. The results are mind-boggling: on AIME 2024, one of the most challenging high school math competitions, R1 achieved 79.8% accuracy, matching OpenAI's O1 model. On MATH-500, it hit 97.3%, and it achieved the 96.3 percentile on Codeforces programming competitions. But perhaps most impressively, they managed to distill these capabilities down to much smaller models: their 14B parameter version outperforms many models several times its size, suggesting that reasoning ability isn't just about raw parameter count but about how you train the model to process information. The recent scuttlebutt on Twitter and Blind (a corporate rumor website) is that these models caught Meta completely off guard and that they perform better than the new Llama4 models which are still being trained. Apparently, the Llama project within Meta has attracted a lot of attention internally from high-ranking technical executives, and as a result they have something like 13 individuals working on the Llama stuff who each individually earn more per year in total compensation than the combined training cost for the DeepSeek-V3 models which outperform it. How do you explain that to Zuck with a straight face? How does Zuck keep smiling while shoveling multiple billions of dollars to Nvidia to buy 100k H100s when a better model was trained using just 2k H100s for a bit over $5mm? But you better believe that Meta and every other big AI lab is taking these DeepSeek models apart, studying every word in those technical reports and every line of the open source code they released, trying desperately to integrate these same tricks and optimizations into their own training and inference pipelines. So what's the impact of all that? Well, naively it sort of seems like the aggregate demand for training and inference compute should be divided by some big number. Maybe not by 45, but maybe by 25 or even 30? Because whatever you thought you needed before these model releases, it's now a lot less. Now, an optimist might say "You are talking about a mere constant of proportionality, a single multiple. When you're dealing with an exponential growth curve, that stuff gets washed out so quickly that it doesn't end up matter all that much." And there is some truth to that: if AI really is as transformational as I expect, if the real-world utility of this tech is measured in the trillions, if inference-time compute is the new scaling law of the land, if we are going to have armies of humanoid robots running around doing massive amounts of inference constantly, then maybe the growth curve is still so steep and extreme, and Nvidia has a big enough lead, that it will still work out. But Nvidia is pricing in a LOT of good news in the coming years for that valuation to make sense, and when you start layering all these things together into a total mosaic, it starts to make me at least feel extremely uneasy about spending ~20x the 2025 estimated sales for their shares. What happens if you even see a slight moderation in sales growth? What if it turns out to be 85% instead of over 100%? What if gross margins come in a bit from 75% to 70%— still ridiculously high for a semiconductor company? At a high level, NVIDIA faces an unprecedented convergence of competitive threats that make its premium valuation increasingly difficult to justify at 20x forward sales and 75% gross margins. The company's supposed moats in hardware, software, and efficiency are all showing concerning cracks. The whole world— thousands of the smartest people on the planet, backed by untold billions of dollars of capital resources— are trying to assail them from every angle. On the hardware front, innovative architectures from Cerebras and Groq demonstrate that NVIDIA's interconnect advantage— a cornerstone of its data center dominance— can be circumvented through radical redesigns. Cerebras' wafer-scale chips and Groq's deterministic compute approach deliver compelling performance without needing NVIDIA's complex interconnect solutions. More traditionally, every major NVIDIA customer (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple) is developing custom silicon that could chip away at high-margin data center revenue. These aren't experimental projects anymore— Amazon alone is building out massive infrastructure with over 400,000 custom chips for Anthropic. The software moat appears equally vulnerable. New high-level frameworks like MLX, Triton, and JAX are abstracting away CUDA's importance, while efforts to improve AMD drivers could unlock much cheaper hardware alternatives. The trend toward higher-level abstractions mirrors how assembly language gave way to C/C++, suggesting CUDA's dominance may be more temporary than assumed. Most importantly, we're seeing the emergence of LLM-powered code translation that could automatically port CUDA code to run on any hardware target, potentially eliminating one of NVIDIA's strongest lock-in effects. Perhaps most devastating is DeepSeek's recent efficiency breakthrough, achieving comparable model performance at approximately 1/45th the compute cost. This suggests the entire industry has been massively over-provisioning compute resources. Combined with the emergence of more efficient inference architectures through chain-of-thought models, the aggregate demand for compute could be significantly lower than current projections assume. The economics here are compelling: when DeepSeek can match GPT-4 level performance while charging 95% less for API calls, it suggests either NVIDIA's customers are burning cash unnecessarily or margins must come down dramatically. The fact that TSMC will manufacture competitive chips for any well-funded customer puts a natural ceiling on NVIDIA's architectural advantages. But more fundamentally, history shows that markets eventually find a way around artificial bottlenecks that generate super-normal profits. When layered together, these threats suggest NVIDIA faces a much rockier path to maintaining its current growth trajectory and margins than its valuation implies. With five distinct vectors of attack— architectural innovation, customer vertical integration, software abstraction, efficiency breakthroughs, and manufacturing democratization— the probability that at least one succeeds in meaningfully impacting NVIDIA's margins or growth rate seems high. At current valuations, the market isn't pricing in any of these risks. I hope you enjoyed reading this article.

Title: The impact of competition and DeepSeek on Nvidia

Jeffrey Emanuel January 25, 2025 60 min read As someone who spent ~10 years working as a generalist investment analyst at various long/short hedge funds (including stints at Millennium and Balyasny), while also being something of a math and computer nerd who has been studying deep learning since 2010 (back when Geoff Hinton was still talking about Restricted Boltzmann Machines and everything was still programmed using MATLAB, and researchers were still trying to show that they could get better results at classifying handwritten digits than by using Support Vector Machines), I'd like to think that I have a fairly unusual perspective on how AI technology is developing and how this relates to equity valuations in the stock market. For the past few years, I have been working more as a developer, and have several popular open-source projects for working with various forms of AI models/services (e.g., see LLM Aided OCR, Swiss Army Llama, Fast Vector Similarity, Source to Prompt, and Pastel Inference Layer for a few recent examples). Basically, I am using these frontier models all day, every day, in about as intense a way as possible. I have 3 Claude accounts so I don't run out of requests, and signed up for ChatGPT Pro within minutes of it being available. I also try to keep on top of the latest research advances, and carefully read all the major technical report papers that come out from the major AI labs. So I think I have a pretty good read on the space and how things are developing. At the same time, I've shorted a ton of stocks in my life and have won the best idea prize on the Value Investors Club twice (for TMS long and PDH short if you're keeping track at home). I say this not to brag, but rather to help establish my bona fides as someone who could opine on the subject without coming across as hopelessly naive to either technologists or professional investors. And while there are surely many people who know the math/science better, and people who are better at long/short investing in the stock market than me, I doubt there are very many who are in the middle of the Venn diagram to the extent I can claim to be. With all that said, whenever I meet with and chat with my friends and ex colleagues from the hedge fund world, the conversation quickly turns to Nvidia. It's not every day that a company goes from relative obscurity to being worth more than the combined stock markets of England, France, or Germany! And naturally, these friends want to know my thoughts on the subject. Because I am such a dyed-in-the-wool believer in the long term transformative impact of this technology— I truly believe it's going to radically change nearly every aspect of our economy and society in the next 5-10 years, with basically no historical precedent— it has been hard for me to make the argument that Nvidia's momentum is going to slow down or stop anytime soon. But even though I've thought the valuation was just too rich for my blood for the past year or so, a confluence of recent developments has caused me to flip a bit to my usual instinct, which is to be a bit more contrarian in outlook and to question the consensus when it seems to be more than priced in. The saying "what the wise man believes in the beginning, the fool believes in the end" became famous for a good reason. Before we get into the developments that give me pause, let's pause to briefly review the bull case for NVDA shares, which is basically now known by everyone and his brother. Deep learning and AI are the most transformative technologies since the internet, and poised to change basically everything in our society. Nvidia has somehow ended up with something close to a monopoly in terms of the share of aggregate industry capex that is spent on training and inference infrastructure. Some of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, etc., have all decided that they must do and spend whatever it takes to stay competitive in this space because they simply cannot afford to be left behind. The amount of capex dollars, gigawatts of electricity used, square footage of new-build data centers, and, of course, the number of GPUs, has absolutely exploded and seems to show no sign of slowing down. And Nvidia is able to earn insanely high 90%+ gross margins on the most high-end, datacenter oriented products. We've just scratched the surface here of the bull case. There are many additional aspects to it now, which have made even people who were already very bullish to become incrementally more bullish. Besides things like the rise of humanoid robots, which I suspect is going to take most people by surprise when they are rapidly able to perform a huge number of tasks that currently require an unskilled (or even skilled) human worker (e.g., doing laundry, cleaning, organizing, and cooking; doing construction work like renovating a bathroom or building a house in a team of workers; running a warehouse and driving forklifts, etc.), there are other factors which most people haven't even considered. One major thing that you hear the smart crowd talking about is the rise of "a new scaling law," which has created a new paradigm thinking about how compute needs will increase over time. The original scaling law, which is what has been driving progress in AI since AlexNet appeared in 2012 and the Transformer architecture was invented in 2017, is the pre-training scaling law: that the more billions (and now trillions) worth of tokens we can use as training data, and the larger the parameter count of the models we are training, and the more FLOPS of compute that we expend on training those models on those tokens, the better the performance of the resulting models on a large variety of highly useful downstream tasks. Not only that, but this improvement is somewhat knowable, to the point where the leading AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic have a pretty good idea of just how good their latest models would be even before they started the actual training runs— in some cases, predicting the benchmarks of the final models to within a couple percentage points. This "original scaling law" has been vitally important, but always caused some doubts in the minds of people projecting the future with it. For one thing, we seem to have already exhausted the world's accumulated set of high quality training data. Of course, that's not literally true— there are still so many old books and periodicals that haven't yet been properly digitized, and even if they have, are not properly licensed for use as training data. The problem is that, even if you give credit for all that stuff— say the sum total of "professionally" produced English language written content from the year 1500 to, say, the year 2000, it's not such a tremendous amount in percentage terms when you're talking about a training corpus of nearly 15 trillion tokens, which is the scale of current frontier models. For a quick reality check of those numbers: Google Books has digitized around 40mm books so far; if a typical book has 50k to 100k words, or 65k to 130k tokens, then that's between 2.6T and 5.2T tokens just from books, though surely a large chunk of that is already included in the training corpora used by the big labs, whether it's strictly legal or not. And there are lots of academic papers, with the arXiv website alone having over 2mm papers. And the Library of Congress has over 3 billion digitized newspaper pages. Taken together, that could be as much as 7T tokens in total, but since much of this is in fact included in training corpora, the remaining "incremental" training data probably isn't all that significant in the grand scheme of things. Of course, there are other ways to gather more training data. You could automatically transcribe every single YouTube video for example, and use that text. And while that might be helpful on the margin, it's certainly of much lower quality than, say, a highly respected textbook on Organic Chemistry as a source of useful knowledge about the world. So we've always had a looming "data wall" when it comes to the original scaling law; although we know we can keep shoveling more and more capex into GPUs and building more and more data centers, it's a lot harder to mass produce useful new human knowledge which is correct and incremental to what is already out there. Now, one intriguing response to this has been the rise of "synthetic data," which is text that is itself the output of an LLM. And while this seems almost nonsensical that it would work to "get high on your own supply" as a way of improving model quality, it actually seems to work very well in practice, at least in the domain of math, logic, and computer programming. The reason, of course, is that these are areas where we can mechanically check and prove the correctness of things. So we can sample from the vast universe of possible math theorems or possible Python scripts, and then actually check if they are correct, and only include them in our corpus if they are. And in this way, we can very dramatically expand our collection of high quality training data, at least in these kinds of areas. And then there are all the other kinds of data we could be training AI on besides text. For example, what if we take the entire whole genome sequencing (around 200 GB to 300 GB uncompressed for a single human being) for 100 million people? That's a lot of data obviously, although the vast majority of it would be nearly identical between any two people. Of course, this could be misleading to compare to textual data from books and the internet for various reasons: But it's still another large source of diverse information that we could train huge models on in the future, which is why I included it. So while there is some hope in terms of being able to capture more and more additional training data, if you look at the rate at which training corpora have grown in recent years, it quickly becomes obvious that we are close to hitting a wall in terms of data availability for "generally useful" knowledge that can get us closer to the ultimate goal of getting artificial super-intelligence which is 10x smarter than John von Neumann and is an absolute world-class expert on every specialty known to man. Besides the limited amount of available data, there have always been a couple other things that have lurked in the back of the mind of proponents of the pre-training scaling law. A big one of these is, after you've finished training the model, what are you supposed to do with all that compute infrastructure? Train the next model? Sure, you can do that, but given the rapid improvement in GPU speed and capacity, and the importance of electricity and other opex in the economic calculations, does it even really make sense to use your 2 year old cluster to train your new model? Surely you'd rather use the brand new data center you just built that costs 10x the old data center and is 20x more powerful because of better technology. The problem is, at some point you do need to amortize the up-front cost of these investments and recoup it with a stream of (hopefully positive) operating profit, right? The market is so excited about AI that it has thankfully ignored this, allowing companies like OpenAI to post breathtaking from-inception, cumulative operating losses while garnering increasingly eye-popping valuations in follow-up investment rounds (although, to their credit, they have also been able to demonstrate very fast growing revenues). But eventually, for this situation to be sustainable over a full market cycle, these data center costs do need to eventually be recouped, hopefully with a profit, which over time is competitive with other investment opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis. OK, so that was the pre-training scaling law. What's this "new" scaling law? Well, that's something that people really just started focusing on in the past year: inference time compute scaling. Before, the vast majority of all the compute you'd expend in the process was the up-front training compute to create the model in the first place. Once you had the trained model, performing inference on that model— i.e., asking a question or having the LLM perform some kind of task for you— used a certain, limited amount of compute. Critically, the total amount of inference compute (measured in various ways, such as FLOPS, in GPU memory footprint, etc.) was much, much less than what was required for the pre-training phase. Of course, the amount of inference compute does flex up when you increase the context window size of the models and the amount of output that you generate from them in one go (although researchers have made breathtaking algorithmic improvements on this front relative to the initial quadratic scaling people originally expected in scaling this up). But essentially, until recently, inference compute was generally a lot less intensive than training compute, and scaled basically linearly with the number of requests you are handling— the more demand for text completions from ChatGPT, for instance, the more inference compute you used up. With the advent of the revolutionary Chain-of-Thought ("COT") models introduced in the past year, most noticeably in OpenAI's flagship O1 model (but very recently in DeepSeek's new R1 model, which we will talk about later in much more detail), all that changed. Instead of the amount of inference compute being directly proportional to the length of the output text generated by the model (scaling up for larger context windows, model size, etc.), these new COT models also generate intermediate "logic tokens"; think of this as a sort of scratchpad or "internal monologue" of the model while it's trying to solve your problem or complete its assigned task. This represents a true sea change in how inference compute works: now, the more tokens you use for this internal chain of thought process, the better the quality of the final output you can provide the user. In effect, it's like giving a human worker more time and resources to accomplish a task, so they can double and triple check their work, do the same basic task in multiple different ways and verify that they come out the same way; take the result they came up with and "plug it in" to the formula to check that it actually does solve the equation, etc. It turns out that this approach works almost amazingly well; it is essentially leveraging the long anticipated power of what is called "reinforcement learning" with the power of the Transformer architecture. It directly addresses the single biggest weakness of the otherwise phenomenally successful Transformer model, which is its propensity to "hallucinate". Basically, the way Transformers work in terms of predicting the next token at each step is that, if they start out on a bad "path" in their initial response, they become almost like a prevaricating child who tries to spin a yarn about why they are actually correct, even if they should have realized mid-stream using common sense that what they are saying couldn't possibly be correct. Because the models are always seeking to be internally consistent and to have each successive generated token flow naturally from the preceding tokens and context, it's very hard for them to course-correct and backtrack. By breaking the inference process into what is effectively many intermediate stages, they can try lots of different things and see what's working and keep trying to course-correct and try other approaches until they can reach a fairly high threshold of confidence that they aren't talking nonsense. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this approach, beyond the fact that it works at all, is that the more logic/COT tokens you use, the better it works. Suddenly, you now have an additional dial you can turn so that, as you increase the amount of COT reasoning tokens (which uses a lot more inference compute, both in terms of FLOPS and memory), the higher the probability is that you will give a correct response— code that runs the first time without errors, or a solution to a logic problem without an obviously wrong deductive step. I can tell you from a lot of firsthand experience that, as good as Anthropic's Claude3.5 Sonnet model is at Python programming— and it is indeed VERY good— whenever you need to generate anything long and complicated, it invariably ends up making one or more stupid mistakes. Now, these mistakes are usually pretty easy to fix, and in fact you can normally fix them by simply feeding the errors generated by the Python interpreter, without any further explanation, as a follow-up inference prompt (or, more usefully, paste in the complete set of detected "problems" found in the code by your code editor, using what something called a Linter), it was still an annoying additional step. And when the code becomes very long or very complicated, it can sometimes take a lot longer to fix, and might even require some manual debugging by hand. The first time I tried the O1 model from OpenAI was like a revelation: I was amazed how often the code would be perfect the very first time. And that's because the COT process automatically finds and fixes problems before they ever make it to a final response token in the answer the model gives you. In fact, the O1 model used in OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus subscription for $20/month is basically the same model as the one used in the O1-Pro model featured in their new ChatGPT Pro subscription for 10x the price ($200/month, which raised plenty of eyebrows in the developer community); the main difference is that O1-Pro thinks for a lot longer before responding, generating vastly more COT logic tokens, and consuming a far larger amount of inference compute for every response. This is quite striking in that, even a very long and complex prompt for Claude3.5 Sonnet or GPT4o, with ~400kb+ of context given, generally takes less than 10 seconds to begin responding, and often less than 5 seconds. Whereas that same prompt to O1-Pro could easily take 5+ MINUTES before you get a response (although OpenAI does show you some of the "reasoning steps" that are generated during the process while you wait; critically, OpenAI has decided, presumably for trade secret related reasons,to hide from you the exact reasoning tokens it generates, showing you instead a highly abbreviated summary of these). As you can probably imagine, there are tons of contexts where accuracy is paramount— where you'd rather give up and tell the user you can't do it at all rather than give an answer that could be trivially proven wrong or which involves hallucinated facts or otherwise specious reasoning. Anything involving money/transactions, medical stuff, legal stuff, just to name a few. Basically, wherever the cost of inference is trivial relative to the hourly all-in compensation of the human knowledge worker who is interacting with the AI system, that's a case where it become a complete no-brainer to dial up the COT compute (the major drawback is that it increases the latency of responses by a lot, so there are still some contexts where you might prefer to iterate faster by getting lower latency responses that are less accurate or correct). Some of the most exciting news in the AI world came out just a few weeks ago and concerned OpenAI's new unreleased O3 model, which was able to solve a large variety of tasks that were previously deemed to be out of reach of current AI approaches in the near term. And the way it was able to do these hardest problems (which include exceptionally tough "foundational" math problems that would be very hard for even highly skilled professional mathematicians to solve), is that OpenAI threw insane amount of compute resources at the problems— in some cases, spending $3k+ worth of compute power to solve a single task (compare this to traditional inference costs for a single task, which would be unlikely to exceed a couple dollars using regular Transformer models without chain-of-thought). It doesn't take an AI genius to realize that this development creates a new scaling law that is totally independent of the original pre-training scaling law. Now, you still want to train the best model you can by cleverly leveraging as much compute as you can and as many trillion tokens of high quality training data as possible, but that's just the beginning of the story in this new world; now, you could easily use incredibly huge amounts of compute just to do inference from these models at a very high level of confidence or when trying to solve extremely tough problems that require "genius level" reasoning to avoid all the potential pitfalls that would lead a regular LLM astray. Even if you believe, as I do, that the future prospects for AI are almost unimaginably bright, the question still remains, "Why should one company extract the majority of the profit pool from this technology?" There are certainly many historical cases where a very important new technology changed the world, but the main winners were not the companies that seemed the most promising during the initial stages of the process. The Wright Brothers' airplane company in all its current incarnations across many different firms today isn't worth more than $10b despite them inventing and perfecting the technology well ahead of everyone else. And while Ford has a respectable market cap of $40b today, it's just 1.1% of Nvidia's current market cap. To understand this, it's important to really understand why Nvidia is currently capturing so much of the pie today. After all, they aren't the only company that even makes GPUs. AMD makes respectable GPUs that, on paper, have comparable numbers of transistors, which are made using similar process nodes, etc. Sure, they aren't as fast or as advanced as Nvidia's GPUs, but it's not like the Nvidia GPUs are 10x faster or anything like that. In fact, in terms of naive/raw dollars per FLOP, AMD GPUs are something like half the price of Nvidia GPUs. Looking at other semiconductor markets such as the DRAM market, despite the fact that it is also very highly consolidated with only 3 meaningful global players (Samsung, Micron, SK-Hynix), gross margins in the DRAM market range from negative at the bottom of the cycle to ~60% at the very top of the cycle, with an average in the 20% range. Compare that to Nvidia's overall gross margin in recent quarters of ~75%, which is dragged down by the lower-margin and more commoditized consumer 3D graphics category. So how is this possible? Well, the main reasons have to do with software— better drivers that "just work" on Linux and which are highly battle-tested and reliable (unlike AMD, which is notorious for the low quality and instability of their Linux drivers), and highly optimized open-source code in popular libraries such as PyTorch that has been tuned to work really well on Nvidia GPUs. It goes beyond that though— the very programming framework that coders use to write low-level code that is optimized for GPUs, CUDA, is totally proprietary to Nvidia, and it has become a de facto standard. If you want to hire a bunch of extremely talented programmers who know how to make things go really fast on GPUs, and pay them $650k/year or whatever the going rate is for people with that particular expertise, chances are that they are going to "think" and work in CUDA. Besides software superiority, the other major thing that Nvidia has going for it is what is known as interconnect— essentially, the bandwidth that connects together thousands of GPUs together efficiently so they can be jointly harnessed to train today's leading-edge foundational models. In short, the key to efficient training is to keep all the GPUs as fully utilized as possible all the time— not waiting around idling until they receive the next chunk of data they need to compute the next step of the training process. The bandwidth requirements are extremely high— much, much higher than the typical bandwidth that is needed in traditional data center use cases. You can't really use traditional networking gear or fiber optics for this kind of interconnect, since it would introduce too much latency and wouldn't give you the pure terabytes per second of bandwidth that is needed to keep all the GPUs constantly busy. Nvidia made an incredibly smart decision to purchase the Israeli company Mellanox back in 2019 for a mere $6.9b, and this acquisition is what provided them with their industry leading interconnect technology. Note that interconnect speed is a lot more relevant to the training process, where you have to harness together the output of thousands of GPUs at the same time, than the inference process (including COT inference), which can use just a handful of GPUs— all you need is enough VRAM to store the quantized (compressed) model weights of the already-trained model. So those are arguably the major components of Nvidia's "moat" and how it has been able to maintain such high margins for so long (there is also a "flywheel" aspect to things, where they aggressively invest their super-normal profits into tons of R&D, which in turn helps them improve their tech at a faster rate than the competition, so they are always in the lead in terms of raw performance). But as was pointed out earlier, what customers really tend to care about, all other things being equal, is performance per dollar (both in up-front capex cost of equipment and in energy usage, so performance per watt), and even though Nvidia's GPUs are certainly the fastest, they are not the best price/performance when measured naively in terms of FLOPS. But the thing is, all other things are NOT equal, and the fact that AMD's drivers suck, that popular AI software libraries don't run as well on AMD GPUs, that you can't find really good GPU experts who specialize in AMD GPUs outside of the gaming world (why would they bother when there is more demand in the market for CUDA experts?), that you can't wire thousands of them together as effectively because of lousy interconnect technology for AMD— all this means that AMD is basically not competitive in the high-end data center world, and doesn't seem to have very good prospects for getting there in the near term. Well, that all sounds very bullish for Nvidia, right? Now you can see why the stock is trading at such a huge valuation! But what are the other clouds on the horizon? Well, there are few that I think merit significant attention. Some have been lurking in the background for the last few years, but too small to make a dent considering how quickly the pie has been growing, but where they are getting ready to potentially inflect upwards. Others are very recent developments (as in, the last 2 weeks) that might dramatically change the near-term trajectory of incremental GPU demand. At a very high level, you can think of things like this: Nvidia operated in a pretty niche area for a very long time; they had very limited competition, and the competition wasn't particular profitable or growing fast enough to ever pose a real threat, since they didn't have the capital needed to really apply pressure to a market leader like Nvidia. The gaming market was large and growing, but didn't feature earth shattering margins or particularly fabulous year over year growth rates. A few big tech companies started ramping up hiring and spending on machine learning and AI efforts around 2016-2017, but it was never a truly significant line item for any of them on an aggregate basis— more of a "moonshot" R&D expenditure. But once the big AI race started in earnest with the release of ChatGPT in 2022— only a bit over 2 years ago, although it seems like a lifetime ago in terms of developments— that situation changed very dramatically. Suddenly, big companies were ready to spend many, many billions of dollars incredibly quickly. The number of researchers showing up at the big research conferences like Neurips and ICML went up very, very dramatically. All the smart students who might have previously studied financial derivatives were instead studying Transformers, and $1mm+ compensation packages for non-executive engineering roles (i.e., for independent contributors not managing a team) became the norm at the leading AI labs. It takes a while to change the direction of a massive cruise ship; and even if you move really quickly and spend billions, it takes a year or more to build greenfield data centers and order all the equipment (with ballooning lead times) and get it all set up and working. It takes a long time to hire and onboard even smart coders before they can really hit their stride and familiarize themselves with the existing codebases and infrastructure. But now, you can imagine that absolutely biblical amounts of capital, brainpower, and effort are being expended in this area. And Nvidia has the biggest target of any player on their back, because they are the ones who are making the lion's share of the profits TODAY, not in some hypothetical future where the AI runs our whole lives. So the very high level takeaway is basically that "markets find a way"; they find alternative, radically innovative new approaches to building hardware that leverage completely new ideas to sidestep barriers that help prop up Nvidia's moat. For example, so-called "wafer scale" AI training chips from Cerebras, which dedicate an entire 300mm silicon wafer to an absolutely gargantuan chip that contains orders of magnitude more transistors and cores on a single chip (see this recent blog post from them explaining how they were able to solve the "yield problem" that had been preventing this approach from being economically practical in the past). To put this into perspective, if you compare Cerebras' newest WSE-3 chip to Nvidia's flagship data-center GPU, the H100, the Cerebras chip has a total die area of 46,225 square millimeters compared to just 814 for the H100 (and the H100 is itself considered an enormous chip by industry standards); that's a multiple of ~57x! And instead of having 132 "streaming multiprocessor" cores enabled on the chip like the H100 has, the Cerebras chip has ~900,000 cores (granted, each of these cores is smaller and does a lot less, but it's still an almost unfathomably large number in comparison). In more concrete apples-to-apples terms, the Cerebras chip can do around ~32x the FLOPS in AI contexts as a single H100 chip. Since an H100 sells for close to $40k a pop, you can imagine that the WSE-3 chip isn't cheap. So why does this all matter? Well, instead of trying to battle Nvidia head-on by using a similar approach and trying to match the Mellanox interconnect technology, Cerebras has used a radically innovative approach to do an end-run around the interconnect problem: inter-processor bandwidth becomes much less of an issue when everything is running on the same super-sized chip. You don't even need to have the same level of interconnect because one mega chip replaces tons of H100s. And the Cerebras chips also work extremely well for AI inference tasks. In fact, you can try it today for free here and use Meta's very respectable Llama-3.3-70B model. It responds basically instantaneously, at ~1,500 tokens per second. To put that into perspective, anything above 30 tokens per second feels relatively snappy to users based on comparisons to ChatGPT and Claude, and even 10 tokens per second is fast enough that you can basically read the response while it's being generated. Cerebras is also not alone; there are other companies, like Groq (not to be confused with the Grok model family trained by Elon Musk's X AI). Groq has taken yet another innovative approach to solving the same fundamental problem. Instead of trying to compete with Nvidia's CUDA software stack directly, they've developed what they call a "tensor processing unit" (TPU) that is specifically designed for the exact mathematical operations that deep learning models need to perform. Their chips are designed around a concept called "deterministic compute," which means that, unlike traditional GPUs where the exact timing of operations can vary, their chips execute operations in a completely predictable way every single time. This might sound like a minor technical detail, but it actually makes a massive difference for both chip design and software development. Because the timing is completely deterministic, Groq can optimize their chips in ways that would be impossible with traditional GPU architectures. As a result, they've been demonstrating for the past 6+ months inference speeds of over 500 tokens per second with the Llama series of models and other open source models, far exceeding what's possible with traditional GPU setups. Like Cerebras, this is available today and you can try it for free here. Using a comparable Llama3 model with "speculative decoding," Groq is able to generate 1,320 tokens per second, on par with Cerebras and far in excess of what is possible using regular GPUs. Now, you might ask what the point is of achieving 1,000+ tokens per second when users seem pretty satisfied with ChatGPT, which is operating at less than 10% of that speed. And the thing is, it does matter. It makes it a lot faster to iterate and not lose focus as a human knowledge worker when you get instant feedback. And if you're using the model programmatically via the API, which is increasingly where much of the demand is coming from, then it can enable whole new classes of applications that require multi-stage inference (where the output of previous stages is used as input in successive stages of prompting/inference) or which require low-latency responses, such as content moderation, fraud detection, dynamic pricing, etc. But even more fundamentally, the faster you can serve requests, the faster you can cycle things, and the busier you can keep the hardware. Although Groq's hardware is extremely expensive, clocking in at $2mm to $3mm for a single server, it ends up costing far less per request fulfilled if you have enough demand to keep the hardware busy all the time. And like Nvidia with CUDA, a huge part of Groq's advantage comes from their own proprietary software stack. They are able to take the same open source models that other companies like Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral develop and release for free, and decompose them in special ways that allow them to run dramatically faster on their specific hardware. Like Cerebras, they have taken different technical decisions to optimize certain particular aspects of the process, which allows them to do things in a fundamentally different way. In Groq's case, it's because they are entirely focused on inference level compute, not on training: all their special sauce hardware and software only give these huge speed and efficiency advantages when doing inference on an already trained model. But if the next big scaling law that people are excited about is for inference level compute— and if the biggest drawback of COT models is the high latency introduced by having to generate all those intermediate logic tokens before they can respond— then even a company that only does inference compute, but which does it dramatically faster and more efficiently than Nvidia can— can introduce a serious competitive threat in the coming years. At the very least, Cerebras and Groq can chip away at the lofty expectations for Nvidia's revenue growth over the next 2-3 years that are embedded in the current equity valuation. Besides these particularly innovative, if relatively unknown, startup competitors, there is some serious competition coming from some of Nvidia's biggest customers themselves who have been making custom silicon that specifically targets AI training and inference workloads. Perhaps the best known of these is Google, which has been developing its own proprietary TPUs since 2016. Interestingly, although it briefly sold TPUs to external customers, Google has been using all its TPUs internally for the past several years, and it is already on its 6th generation of TPU hardware. Amazon has also been developing its own custom chips called Trainium2 and Inferentia2. And while Amazon is building out data centers featuring billions of dollars of Nvidia GPUs, they are also at the same time investing many billions in other data centers that use these internal chips. They have one cluster that they are bringing online for Anthropic that features over 400k chips. Amazon gets a lot of flak for totally bungling their internal AI model development, squandering massive amounts of internal compute resources on models that ultimately are not competitive, but the custom silicon is another matter. Again, they don't necessarily need their chips to be better and faster than Nvidia's. What they need is for their chips to be good enough, but build them at a breakeven gross margin instead of the ~90%+ gross margin that Nvidia earns on its H100 business. OpenAI has also announced their plans to build custom chips, and they (together with Microsoft) are obviously the single largest user of Nvidia's data center hardware. As if that weren't enough, Microsoft have themselves announced their own custom chips! And Apple, the most valuable technology company in the world, has been blowing away expectations for years now with their highly innovative and disruptive custom silicon operation, which now completely trounces the CPUs from both Intel and AMD in terms of performance per watt, which is the most important factor in mobile (phone/tablet/laptop) applications. And they have been making their own internally designed GPUs and "Neural Processors" for years, even though they have yet to really demonstrate the utility of such chips outside of their own custom applications, like the advanced software based image processing used in the iPhone's camera. While Apple's focus seems somewhat orthogonal to these other players in terms of its mobile-first, consumer oriented, "edge compute" focus, if it ends up spending enough money on its new contract with OpenAI to provide AI services to iPhone users, you have to imagine that they have teams looking into making their own custom silicon for inference/training (although given their secrecy, you might never even know about it directly!). Now, it's no secret that there is a strong power law distribution of Nvidia's hyper-scaler customer base, with the top handful of customers representing the lion's share of high-margin revenue. How should one think about the future of this business when literally every single one of these VIP customers is building their own custom chips specifically for AI training and inference? When thinking about all this, you should keep one incredibly important thing in mind: Nvidia is largely an IP based company. They don't make their own chips. The true special sauce for making these incredible devices arguably comes more from TSMC, the actual fab, and ASML, which makes the special EUV lithography machines used by TSMC to make these leading-edge process node chips. And that's critically important, because TSMC will sell their most advanced chips to anyone who comes to them with enough up-front investment and is willing to guarantee a certain amount of volume. They don't care if it's for Bitcoin mining ASICs, GPUs, TPUs, mobile phone SoCs, etc. As much as senior chip designers at Nvidia earn per year, surely some of the best of them could be lured away by these other tech behemoths for enough cash and stock. And once they have a team and resources, they can design innovative chips (again, perhaps not even 50% as advanced as an H100, but with that Nvidia gross margin, there is plenty of room to work with) in 2 to 3 years, and thanks for TSMC, they can turn those into actual silicon using the exact same process node technology as Nvidia. As if these looming hardware threats weren't bad enough, there are a few developments in the software world in the last couple years that, while they started out slowly, are now picking up real steam and could pose a serious threat to the software dominance of Nvidia's CUDA. The first of these is the horrible Linux drivers for AMD GPUs. Remember we talked about how AMD has inexplicably allowed these drivers to suck for years despite leaving massive amounts of money on the table? Well, amusingly enough, the infamous hacker George Hotz (famous for jailbreaking the original iphone as a teenager, and currently the CEO of self-driving startup Comma.ai and AI computer company Tiny Corp, which also makes the open-source tinygrad AI software framework), recently announced that he was sick and tired of dealing with AMD's bad drivers, and desperately wanted to be able to to leverage the lower cost AMD GPUs in their TinyBox AI computers (which come in multiple flavors, some of which use Nvidia GPUs, and some of which use AMD GPUS). Well, he is making his own custom drivers and software stack for AMD GPUs without any help from AMD themselves; on Jan. 15th of 2025, he tweeted via his company's X account that "We are one piece away from a completely sovereign stack on AMD, the RDNA3 assembler. We have our own driver, runtime, libraries, and emulator. (all in ~12,000 lines!)" Given his track record and skills, it is likely that they will have this all working in the next couple months, and this would allow for a lot of exciting possibilities of using AMD GPUs for all sorts of applications where companies currently feel compelled to pay up for Nvidia GPUs. OK, well that's just a driver for AMD, and it's not even done yet. What else is there? Well, there are a few other areas on the software side that are a lot more impactful. For one, there is now a massive concerted effort across many large tech companies and the open source software community at large to make more generic AI software frameworks that have CUDA as just one of many "compilation targets". That is, you write your software using higher-level abstractions, and the system itself can automatically turn those high-level constructs into super well-tuned low-level code that works extremely well on CUDA. But because it's done at this higher level of abstraction, it can just as easily get compiled into low-level code that works extremely well on lots of other GPUs and TPUs from a variety of providers, such as the massive number of custom chips in the pipeline from every big tech company. The most famous examples of these frameworks are MLX (sponsored primarily by Apple), Triton (sponsored primarily by OpenAI), and JAX (developed by Google). MLX is particularly interesting because it provides a PyTorch-like API that can run efficiently on Apple Silicon, showing how these abstraction layers can enable AI workloads to run on completely different architectures. Triton, meanwhile, has become increasingly popular as it allows developers to write high-performance code that can be compiled to run on various hardware targets without having to understand the low-level details of each platform. These frameworks allow developers to write their code once using high powered abstractions and then target tons of platforms automatically— doesn't that sound like a better way to do things, which would give you a lot more flexibility in terms of how you actually run the code? In the 1980s, all the most popular, best selling software was written in hand-tuned assembly language. The PKZIP compression utility for example was hand crafted to maximize speed, to the point where a competently coded version written in the standard C programming language and compiled using the best available optimizing compilers at the time, would run at probably half the speed of the hand-tuned assembly code. The same is true for other popular software packages like WordStar, VisiCalc, and so on. Over time, compilers kept getting better and better, and every time the CPU architectures changed (say, from Intel releasing the 486, then the Pentium, and so on), that hand-rolled assembler would often have to be thrown out and rewritten, something that only the smartest coders were capable of (sort of like how CUDA experts are on a different level in the job market versus a "regular" software developer). Eventually, things converged so that the speed benefits of hand-rolled assembly were outweighed dramatically by the flexibility of being able to write code in a high-level language like C or C++, where you rely on the compiler to make things run really optimally on the given CPU. Nowadays, very little new code is written in assembly. I believe a similar transformation will end up happening for AI training and inference code, for similar reasons: computers are good at optimization, and flexibility and speed of development is increasingly the more important factor— especially if it also allows you to save dramatically on your hardware bill because you don't need to keep paying the "CUDA tax" that gives Nvidia 90%+ margins. Yet another area where you might see things change dramatically is that CUDA might very well end up being more of a high level abstraction itself— a "specification language" similar to Verilog (used as the industry standard to describe chip layouts) that skilled developers can use to describe high-level algorithms that involve massive parallelism (since they are already familiar with it, it's very well constructed, it's the lingua franca, etc.), but then instead of having that code compiled for use on Nvidia GPUs like you would normally do, it can instead be fed as source code into an LLM which can port it into whatever low-level code is understood by the new Cerebras chip, or the new Amazon Trainium2, or the new Google TPUv6, etc. This isn't as far off as you might think; it's probably already well within reach using OpenAI's latest O3 model, and surely will be possible generally within a year or two. Perhaps the most shocking development which was alluded to earlier happened in the last couple of weeks. And that is the news that has totally rocked the AI world, and which has been dominating the discourse among knowledgeable people on Twitter despite its complete absence from any of the mainstream media outlets: that a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek released two new models that have basically world-competitive performance levels on par with the best models from OpenAI and Anthropic (blowing past the Meta Llama3 models and other smaller open source model players such as Mistral). These models are called DeepSeek-V3 (basically their answer to GPT-4o and Claude3.5 Sonnet) and DeepSeek-R1 (basically their answer to OpenAI's O1 model). Why is this all so shocking? Well, first of all, DeepSeek is a tiny Chinese company that reportedly has under 200 employees. The story goes that they started out as a quant trading hedge fund similar to TwoSigma or RenTec, but after Xi Jinping cracked down on that space, they used their math and engineering chops to pivot into AI research. Who knows if any of that is really true or if they are merely some kind of front for the CCP or the Chinese military. But the fact remains that they have released two incredibly detailed technical reports, for DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeekR1. These are heavy technical reports, and if you don't know a lot of linear algebra, you probably won't understand much. But what you should really try is to download the free DeepSeek app on the AppStore here and install it using a Google account to log in and give it a try (you can also install it on Android here), or simply try it out on your desktop computer in the browser here. Make sure to select the "DeepThink" option to enable chain-of-thought (the R1 model) and ask it to explain parts of the technical reports in simple terms. This will simultaneously show you a few important things: One, this model is absolutely legit. There is a lot of BS that goes on with AI benchmarks, which are routinely gamed so that models appear to perform great on the benchmarks but then suck in real world tests. Google is certainly the worst offender in this regard, constantly crowing about how amazing their LLMs are, when they are so awful in any real world test that they can't even reliably accomplish the simplest possible tasks, let alone challenging coding tasks. These DeepSeek models are not like that— the responses are coherent, compelling, and absolutely on the same level as those from OpenAI and Anthropic. Two, that DeepSeek has made profound advancements not just in model quality, but more importantly in model training and inference efficiency. By being extremely close to the hardware and by layering together a handful of distinct, very clever optimizations, DeepSeek was able to train these incredible models using GPUs in a dramatically more efficient way. By some measurements, over ~45x more efficiently than other leading-edge models. DeepSeek claims that the complete cost to train DeepSeek-V3 was just over $5mm. That is absolutely nothing by the standards of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., which were well into the $100mm+ level for training costs for a single model as early as 2024. How in the world could this be possible? How could this little Chinese company completely upstage all the smartest minds at our leading AI labs, which have 100 times more resources, headcount, payroll, capital, GPUs, etc? Wasn't China supposed to be crippled by Biden's restriction on GPU exports? Well, the details are fairly technical, but we can at least describe them at a high level. It might have just turned out that the relative GPU processing poverty of DeepSeek was the critical ingredient to make them more creative and clever, necessity being the mother of invention and all. A major innovation is their sophisticated mixed-precision training framework that lets them use 8-bit floating point numbers (FP8) throughout the entire training process. Most Western AI labs train using "full precision" 32-bit numbers (this basically specifies the number of gradations possible in describing the output of an artificial neuron; 8 bits in FP8 lets you store a much wider range of numbers than you might expect— it's not just limited to 256 different equal-sized magnitudes like you'd get with regular integers, but instead uses clever math tricks to store both very small and very large numbers— though naturally with less precision than you'd get with 32 bits.) The main tradeoff is that while FP32 can store numbers with incredible precision across an enormous range, FP8 sacrifices some of that precision to save memory and boost performance, while still maintaining enough accuracy for many AI workloads. DeepSeek cracked this problem by developing a clever system that breaks numbers into small tiles for activations and blocks for weights, and strategically uses high-precision calculations at key points in the network. Unlike other labs that train in high precision and then compress later (losing some quality in the process), DeepSeek's native FP8 approach means they get the massive memory savings without compromising performance. When you're training across thousands of GPUs, this dramatic reduction in memory requirements per GPU translates into needing far fewer GPUs overall. Another major breakthrough is their multi-token prediction system. Most Transformer based LLM models do inference by predicting the next token— one token at a time. DeepSeek figured out how to predict multiple tokens while maintaining the quality you'd get from single-token prediction. Their approach achieves about 85-90% accuracy on these additional token predictions, which effectively doubles inference speed without sacrificing much quality. The clever part is they maintain the complete causal chain of predictions, so the model isn't just guessing— it's making structured, contextual predictions. One of their most innovative developments is what they call Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This is a breakthrough in how they handle what are called the Key-Value indices, which are basically how individual tokens are represented in the attention mechanism within the Transformer architecture. Although this is getting a bit too advanced in technical terms, suffice it to say that these KV indices are some of the major uses of VRAM during the training and inference process, and part of the reason why you need to use thousands of GPUs at the same time to train these models— each GPU has a maximum of 96 gb of VRAM, and these indices eat that memory up for breakfast. Their MLA system finds a way to store a compressed version of these indices that captures the essential information while using far less memory. The brilliant part is this compression is built directly into how the model learns— it's not some separate step they need to do, it's built directly into the end-to-end training pipeline. This means that the entire mechanism is "differentiable" and able to be trained directly using the standard optimizers. All this stuff works because these models are ultimately finding much lower-dimensional representations of the underlying data than the so-called "ambient dimensions". So it's wasteful to store the full KV indices, even though that is basically what everyone else does. Not only do you end up wasting tons of space by storing way more numbers than you need, which gives a massive boost to the training memory footprint and efficiency (again, slashing the number of GPUs you need to train a world class model), but it can actually end up improving model quality because it can act like a "regularizer," forcing the model to pay attention to the truly important stuff instead of using the wasted capacity to fit to noise in the training data. So not only do you save a ton of memory, but the model might even perform better. At the very least, you don't get a massive hit to performance in exchange for the huge memory savings, which is generally the kind of tradeoff you are faced with in AI training. They also made major advances in GPU communication efficiency through their DualPipe algorithm and custom communication kernels. This system intelligently overlaps computation and communication, carefully balancing GPU resources between these tasks. They only need about 20 of their GPUs' streaming multiprocessors (SMs) for communication, leaving the rest free for computation. The result is much higher GPU utilization than typical training setups achieve. Another very smart thing they did is to use what is known as a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) Transformer architecture, but with key innovations around load balancing. As you might know, the size or capacity of an AI model is often measured in terms of the number of parameters the model contains. A parameter is just a number that stores some attribute of the model; either the "weight" or importance a particular artificial neuron has relative to another one, or the importance of a particular token depending on its context (in the "attention mechanism"), etc. Meta's latest Llama3 models come in a few sizes, for example: a 1 billion parameter version (the smallest), a 70B parameter model (the most commonly deployed one), and even a massive 405B parameter model. This largest model is of limited utility for most users because you would need to have tens of thousands of dollars worth of GPUs in your computer just to run at tolerable speeds for inference, at least if you deployed it in the naive full-precision version. Therefore most of the real-world usage and excitement surrounding these open source models is at the 8B parameter or highly quantized 70B parameter level, since that's what can fit in a consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPU, which you can buy now for under $1,000. So why does any of this matter? Well, in a sense, the parameter count and precision tells you something about how much raw information or data the model has stored internally. Note that I'm not talking about reasoning ability, or the model's "IQ" if you will: it turns out that models with even surprisingly modest parameter counts can show remarkable cognitive performance when it comes to solving complex logic problems, proving theorems in plane geometry, SAT math problems, etc. But those small models aren't going to be able to necessarily tell you every aspect of every plot twist in every single novel by Stendhal, whereas the really big models can potentially do that. The "cost" of that extreme level of knowledge is that the models become very unwieldy both to train and to do inference on, because you always need to store every single one of those 405B parameters (or whatever the parameter count is) in the GPU's VRAM at the same time in order to do any inference with the model. The beauty of the MOE model approach is that you can decompose the big model into a collection of smaller models that each know different, non-overlapping (at least fully) pieces of knowledge. DeepSeek's innovation here was developing what they call an "auxiliary-loss-free" load balancing strategy that maintains efficient expert utilization without the usual performance degradation that comes from load balancing. Then, depending on the nature of the inference request, you can intelligently route the inference to the "expert" models within that collection of smaller models that are most able to answer that question or solve that task. You can loosely think of it as being a committee of experts who have their own specialized knowledge domains: one might be a legal expert, the other a computer science expert, the other a business strategy expert. So if a question comes in about linear algebra, you don't give it to the legal expert. This is of course a very loose analogy and it doesn't actually work like this in practice. The real advantage of this approach is that it allows the model to contain a huge amount of knowledge without being very unwieldy, because even though the aggregate number of parameters is high across all the experts, only a small subset of these parameters is "active" at any given time, which means that you only need to store this small subset of weights in VRAM in order to do inference. In the case of DeepSeek-V3, they have an absolutely massive MOE model with 671B parameters, so it's much bigger than even the largest Llama3 model, but only 37B of these parameters are active at any given time— enough to fit in the VRAM of two consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPUs (under $2,000 total cost), rather than requiring one or more H100 GPUs which cost something like $40k each. It's rumored that both ChatGPT and Claude use an MoE architecture, with some leaks suggesting that GPT-4 had a total of 1.8 trillion parameters split across 8 models containing 220 billion parameters each. Despite that being a lot more doable than trying to fit all 1.8 trillion parameters in VRAM, it still requires multiple H100-grade GPUs just to run the model because of the massive amount of memory used. Beyond what has already been described, the technical papers mention several other key optimizations. These include their extremely memory-efficient training framework that avoids tensor parallelism, recomputes certain operations during backpropagation instead of storing them, and shares parameters between the main model and auxiliary prediction modules. The sum total of all these innovations, when layered together, has led to the ~45x efficiency improvement numbers that have been tossed around online, and I am perfectly willing to believe these are in the right ballpark. One very strong indicator that it's true is the cost of DeepSeek's API: despite this nearly best-in-class model performance, DeepSeek charges something like 95% less money for inference requests via its API than comparable models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In a sense, it's sort of like comparing Nvidia's GPUs to the new custom chips from competitors: even if they aren't quite as good, the value for money is so much better that it can still be a no-brainer depending on the application, as long as you can qualify the performance level and prove that it's good enough for your requirements and the API availability and latency is good enough (thus far, people have been amazed at how well DeepSeek's infrastructure has held up despite the truly incredible surge of demand owing to the performance of these new models). But unlike the case of Nvidia, where the cost differential is the result of them earning monopoly gross margins of 90%+ on their data-center products, the cost differential of the DeepSeek API relative to the OpenAI and Anthropic API could be simply that they are nearly 50x more compute efficient (it might even be significantly more than that on the inference side— the ~45x efficiency was on the training side). Indeed, it's not even clear that OpenAI and Anthropic are making great margins on their API services— they might be more interested in revenue growth and gathering more data from analyzing all the API requests they receive. Before moving on, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that many people are speculating that DeepSeek is simply lying about the number of GPUs and GPU hours spent training these models because they actually possess far more H100s than they are supposed to have given the export restrictions on these cards, and they don't want to cause trouble for themselves or hurt their chances of acquiring more of these cards. While it's certainly possible, I think it's more likely that they are telling the truth, and that they have simply been able to achieve these incredible results by being extremely clever and creative in their approach to training and inference. They explain how they are doing things, and I suspect that it's only a matter of time before their results are widely replicated and confirmed by other researchers at various other labs. The newer R1 model and technical report might even be even more mind blowing, since they were able to beat Anthropic to Chain-of-thought and now are basically the only ones besides OpenAI who have made this technology work at scale. But note that the O1 preview model was only released by OpenAI in mid-September of 2024. That's only ~4 months ago! Something you absolutely must keep in mind is that, unlike OpenAI, which is incredibly secretive about how these models really work at a low level, and won't release the actual model weights to anyone besides partners like Microsoft and other who sign heavy-duty NDAs, these DeepSeek models are both completely open-source and permissively licensed. They have released extremely detailed technical reports explaining how they work, as well as the code that anyone can look at and try to copy. With R1, DeepSeek essentially cracked one of the holy grails of AI: getting models to reason step-by-step without relying on massive supervised datasets. Their DeepSeek-R1-Zero experiment showed something remarkable: using pure reinforcement learning with carefully crafted reward functions, they managed to get models to develop sophisticated reasoning capabilities completely autonomously. This wasn't just about solving problems— the model organically learned to generate long chains of thought, self-verify its work, and allocate more computation time to harder problems. The technical breakthrough here was their novel approach to reward modeling. Rather than using complex neural reward models that can lead to "reward hacking" (where the model finds bogus ways to boost their rewards that don't actually lead to better real-world model performance), they developed a clever rule-based system that combines accuracy rewards (verifying final answers) with format rewards (encouraging structured thinking). This simpler approach turned out to be more robust and scalable than the process-based reward models that others have tried. What's particularly fascinating is that during training, they observed what they called an "aha moment," a phase where the model spontaneously learned to revise its thinking process mid-stream when encountering uncertainty. This emergent behavior wasn't explicitly programmed; it arose naturally from the interaction between the model and the reinforcement learning environment. The model would literally stop itself, flag potential issues in its reasoning, and restart with a different approach, all without being explicitly trained to do this. The full R1 model built on these insights by introducing what they call "cold-start" data— a small set of high-quality examples— before applying their RL techniques. They also solved one of the major challenges in reasoning models: language consistency. Previous attempts at chain-of-thought reasoning often resulted in models mixing languages or producing incoherent outputs. DeepSeek solved this through a clever language consistency reward during RL training, trading off a small performance hit for much more readable and consistent outputs. The results are mind-boggling: on AIME 2024, one of the most challenging high school math competitions, R1 achieved 79.8% accuracy, matching OpenAI's O1 model. On MATH-500, it hit 97.3%, and it achieved the 96.3 percentile on Codeforces programming competitions. But perhaps most impressively, they managed to distill these capabilities down to much smaller models: their 14B parameter version outperforms many models several times its size, suggesting that reasoning ability isn't just about raw parameter count but about how you train the model to process information. The recent scuttlebutt on Twitter and Blind (a corporate rumor website) is that these models caught Meta completely off guard and that they perform better than the new Llama4 models which are still being trained. Apparently, the Llama project within Meta has attracted a lot of attention internally from high-ranking technical executives, and as a result they have something like 13 individuals working on the Llama stuff who each individually earn more per year in total compensation than the combined training cost for the DeepSeek-V3 models which outperform it. How do you explain that to Zuck with a straight face? How does Zuck keep smiling while shoveling multiple billions of dollars to Nvidia to buy 100k H100s when a better model was trained using just 2k H100s for a bit over $5mm? But you better believe that Meta and every other big AI lab is taking these DeepSeek models apart, studying every word in those technical reports and every line of the open source code they released, trying desperately to integrate these same tricks and optimizations into their own training and inference pipelines. So what's the impact of all that? Well, naively it sort of seems like the aggregate demand for training and inference compute should be divided by some big number. Maybe not by 45, but maybe by 25 or even 30? Because whatever you thought you needed before these model releases, it's now a lot less. Now, an optimist might say "You are talking about a mere constant of proportionality, a single multiple. When you're dealing with an exponential growth curve, that stuff gets washed out so quickly that it doesn't end up matter all that much." And there is some truth to that: if AI really is as transformational as I expect, if the real-world utility of this tech is measured in the trillions, if inference-time compute is the new scaling law of the land, if we are going to have armies of humanoid robots running around doing massive amounts of inference constantly, then maybe the growth curve is still so steep and extreme, and Nvidia has a big enough lead, that it will still work out. But Nvidia is pricing in a LOT of good news in the coming years for that valuation to make sense, and when you start layering all these things together into a total mosaic, it starts to make me at least feel extremely uneasy about spending ~20x the 2025 estimated sales for their shares. What happens if you even see a slight moderation in sales growth? What if it turns out to be 85% instead of over 100%? What if gross margins come in a bit from 75% to 70%— still ridiculously high for a semiconductor company? At a high level, NVIDIA faces an unprecedented convergence of competitive threats that make its premium valuation increasingly difficult to justify at 20x forward sales and 75% gross margins. The company's supposed moats in hardware, software, and efficiency are all showing concerning cracks. The whole world— thousands of the smartest people on the planet, backed by untold billions of dollars of capital resources— are trying to assail them from every angle. On the hardware front, innovative architectures from Cerebras and Groq demonstrate that NVIDIA's interconnect advantage— a cornerstone of its data center dominance— can be circumvented through radical redesigns. Cerebras' wafer-scale chips and Groq's deterministic compute approach deliver compelling performance without needing NVIDIA's complex interconnect solutions. More traditionally, every major NVIDIA customer (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple) is developing custom silicon that could chip away at high-margin data center revenue. These aren't experimental projects anymore— Amazon alone is building out massive infrastructure with over 400,000 custom chips for Anthropic. The software moat appears equally vulnerable. New high-level frameworks like MLX, Triton, and JAX are abstracting away CUDA's importance, while efforts to improve AMD drivers could unlock much cheaper hardware alternatives. The trend toward higher-level abstractions mirrors how assembly language gave way to C/C++, suggesting CUDA's dominance may be more temporary than assumed. Most importantly, we're seeing the emergence of LLM-powered code translation that could automatically port CUDA code to run on any hardware target, potentially eliminating one of NVIDIA's strongest lock-in effects. Perhaps most devastating is DeepSeek's recent efficiency breakthrough, achieving comparable model performance at approximately 1/45th the compute cost. This suggests the entire industry has been massively over-provisioning compute resources. Combined with the emergence of more efficient inference architectures through chain-of-thought models, the aggregate demand for compute could be significantly lower than current projections assume. The economics here are compelling: when DeepSeek can match GPT-4 level performance while charging 95% less for API calls, it suggests either NVIDIA's customers are burning cash unnecessarily or margins must come down dramatically. The fact that TSMC will manufacture competitive chips for any well-funded customer puts a natural ceiling on NVIDIA's architectural advantages. But more fundamentally, history shows that markets eventually find a way around artificial bottlenecks that generate super-normal profits. When layered together, these threats suggest NVIDIA faces a much rockier path to maintaining its current growth trajectory and margins than its valuation implies. With five distinct vectors of attack— architectural innovation, customer vertical integration, software abstraction, efficiency breakthroughs, and manufacturing democratization— the probability that at least one succeeds in meaningfully impacting NVIDIA's margins or growth rate seems high. At current valuations, the market isn't pricing in any of these risks. I hope you enjoyed reading this article.

Title: How A Little Bitcoin Could Have Transformed Your Portfolio

HUAI'AN, CHINA - NOVEMBER 11, 2024 - Bitcoin gift commemorative coins are displayed in Huai 'an, ... [+] Jiangsu province, China, November 11, 2024. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Hindsight is 20/20 and if we could go back in time, our portfolios would likely have heaps of Nvidia, Tesla and — you guessed it — Bitcoin. The latter’s meteoric rise has left a number of investors in various states of emotion. Some have been euphoric, while others are regretful thinking back to times when Bitcoin was trading for just a few thousand dollars. Heck, even the sub-$30,000 prices throughout 2023 were a bargain in hindsight. However, that’s the problem with hindsight: Everything seems crystal clear, even when that wasn’t the case at the time. Perhaps in no other endeavor is that more true than when it comes to investing. I remember talking with a wealth manager friend of mine several years ago as they tried to juggle giving advice on Bitcoin at a time where their firm did not offer exposure to cryptoassets. They conceded that while they didn’t necessarily believe in Bitcoin, that small exposure (for instance, 5% or less of their portfolio) could be reasonable for investors who do believe in Bitcoin’s potential. I took a look at what that kind of exposure would mean for an investor’s portfolio, and you know what? A little bit of Bitcoin has gone a long way for those who took the risk. Returns generated with Portfolio Visualizer. Data tracks from 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2024 In our example portfolio, we only allocated 5% of its assets to Bitcoin and put the rest in the S&P 500, while the other portfolio was composed of 100% S&P 500 exposure. At the time, some investors felt that even risking something between $100 and $500 on a $10,000 portfolio (a 1% to 5% allocation) was like throwing money away. Looking back though, that “risk” feels so minuscule — now. In our example, a $10,000 portfolio would have grown to more than $65,000 with the Bitcoin allocation vs. a portfolio value of roughly $34,000 under the all-stock approach. In other words, the cumulative return for that portfolio more than doubled vs. the portfolio that was composed of 100% stocks (554% vs. 238%). Don’t get me wrong, turning $10,000 into more than $30,000 in a decade is stellar work, regardless of other what-ifs. However, to see such a massive change in performance due to a small allocation in a risky asset really underscores the long-term compounding effects when that asset turns out to be a huge winner. From a drawdown perspective, the all-stock portfolio suffered a maximum decline of nearly 24% as a result of the 2022 bear market. However, the portfolio with the 5% Bitcoin allocation only suffered a maximum drawdown of 25.6% (which occurred during the same period). And had Bitcoin gone to zero? Well, here’s the fun part. Even with a total loss on a 5% Bitcoin allocation, the portfolio still would have generated a compound annual growth rate of 12.6% — just slightly below the 13% CAGR of the all-stock portfolio. Looking back, those who allocated a small percentage of their portfolio to Bitcoin faced two major risks: The existential risk that Bitcoin declined toward zero and the added volatility of the cryptocurrency as it ebbed and flowed for the past decade. The 10-year monthly performance for Bitcoin. Source: eToro, Bloomberg In hindsight, most investors would have gladly accepted what turned out to be less than two percentage points of additional downside risk in exchange for more than 300 additional percentage points on the upside. The added volatility? Well, that would have been harder to stomach. The point here isn’t to make people feel bad about Bitcoin — or really, any other asset or stock that has done exceptionally well over the past five to ten years. Instead, the goal here is to rethink risk — not in a way that attempts to justify an unnecessary gamble, but in a way that results in taking a calculated risk when investors have strong conviction. For every Nvidia or Bitcoin there are dozens or perhaps hundreds of investments that failed to work out. In that context, investors shouldn’t take a shot on everything they see trending on social media. To get that conviction, they need to approach the markets with an open mind and do the research. If after all of that, investors feel strongly about a specific asset or holding, they can approach it with a bite-sized amount of risk. If it completely fails, it won’t cost them all of their hard-earned savings. But if it pans out — like Bitcoin did — it could drastically enhance their long-term returns. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Weird Economic Fear Gives Us A 13% Discount On This Dividend Payer

Middle aged man hugging US dollars with a frightrened facial expression We hear a lot of chatter in the business media about productivity these days—specifically how it could decline in the U.S. (and, by extension, hit our gains from stocks—and stock-focused CEFs). Today we’re going to look at why this fear is overblown, and how we income investors can profit—and collect a 6.7% dividend at a 13% discount—off that disconnect. U.S. productivity, for its part, rises by about 2% on average per year. As we discussed a couple weeks back, the S&P 500 has posted a 10.4% annualized gain since the late 1980s, and we can say that rising productivity accounts for about a fifth of that, so about a 2% gain in stocks on an annualized basis. Before we go further, we should spell out what we mean by productivity. The Bureau of Labor Statistics sees it as a measure of how much more efficient private companies become due to technology improvements, economies of scale, resource allocation, labor, management and infrastructure that influence overall efficiency. Worker Productivity Over the last 40 years, productivity has grown by 0.8% per year. (This number is lower than the 2% rate for public companies because it includes private firms). This rate has stayed steady over this 40-year period, suggesting that American companies aren’t running out of ways to make more with less. Crucially, this has happened while the U.S. population aged at an accelerating rate. Age Dependency Ratio If we look at the age-dependency ratio (a ratio of people older than 64 to the working-age population, defined as people from 15 to 64), we see that it’s risen by 1.1% annualized over the last 40 years. But most of those gains happened in the last 20 years; in the first 20 years, this ratio went up by a mere 0.2% annualized. So if an aging society were a hit to productivity, we would expect the productivity gains to slow down or even reverse in the last 20 years versus the prior 20 years by a big margin, and the data simply doesn’t tell us that. So how much older can America get before demographics become a real concern? One way to think of this is to look at Japan, where the age-dependency ratio is 50, nearly double America’s current rate. In Japan, productivity has flatlined since the late 1980s as a result of that country’s economic bubble bursting. But even as its age-dependency ratio sped up in the 1990s and 2000s, Japan’s productivity didn’t collapse. Japan Age Dependency Of course, the flatline in productivity would mean that the 2% annualized gain for S&P 500 companies we noted as being driven by productivity gains above would vanish, lowering stock returns. So maybe we aren’t out of the woods yet? There’s just one problem with this conclusion: The flatlining in productivity started when Japan’s old-age dependency ratio was two-thirds what it is in America today, at the level the US saw in 1980. So it clearly wasn’t demographics that caused this productivity drop in Japan. And, in fact, if we zoom out, we quickly see the issue: From 1954 to 1990, Japan’s productivity across all sectors grew at an annualized 2% per year, and from 1954 to today it’s grown by 1.0%, still ahead of America’s 0.8% rate. If you know your history, you can see what’s happening here: The after-effects of World War II and the demographics of that period were a lot different from today’s world, which is why extrapolating productivity trends from the ratio of old to young just doesn’t make sense. There are more important factors at play today, like technological gains, business regulation and whether public firms are incentivized to keep passing on their earnings to shareholders. America has outrun both Japan and the rest of the world on all of these factors, as we can see from this chart of the gains in benchmark index funds for the S&P 500 (in purple), global stocks, excluding America (in orange) and Japanese stocks (in blue). US Stocks Outperform Considering this, the current pause in stock-market gains we’ve seen in 2025 so far is a blessing and an opportunity. For those who’ve been out of the market out of fear that the recovery of the last two years is played out, the mostly flat movement of the S&P 500 over the last month allows some time to jump back in. It’s also creating an opportunity to compound this potential in some high-quality stock-focused CEFs like the 6.7%-yielding Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (GDV), whose discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the stocks it holds) has been narrowing, while still remaining attractive, at around 13%: GDV Discount GDV has been oversold for a while, and investors realized this last year and started to bid its discount up from the near-18% level to where it is today. However, the fund remains much cheaper than the average 6.6% discount for all equity CEFs and is focused on high-quality US companies like American Express (AXP), Mastercard (MA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), its fund’s top-three holdings. Plus, because of GDV’s deep discount, the yield on its NAV (as opposed to the discounted market price) comes in at 5.9%. That’s significantly below the 6.7% yield on market price and is much less than the fund’s 7.4% annualized total NAV returns over the last decade.

Title: Scale AI’s 28-Year-Old Billionaire CEO Warns About This Scarily Good Chinese Startup

For around a decade, the U.S. has retained its A.I. dominance over China, according to Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old founder and CEO of Scale AI, a $13 billion startup. But with the Christmas release of an “earth-shattering” A.I. model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek, the gap between the two countries is becoming dangerously narrower, Wang said in an interview with CNBC on Jan. 23. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Earlier this week, DeepSeek released a second A.I. model that demonstrates reasoning capabilities rivaling those from top U.S. companies like OpenAI. In addition to shocking researchers with its performance, the Chinese startup’s rapid progress has raised questions about the effectiveness of A.I. chip export controls intended to curb China’s access to the advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) underpinning A.I. tools. “The A.I. race and the A.I. war between the U.S. and China is one of the most important issues of today,” said Wang, who recently took out a full-page advertisement in The Washington Post urging the Trump administration to protect America’s lead over the emerging technology. The advertisement pointed readers to a letter from Wang that claimed China’s A.I. models are quickly catching up and called upon the federal government to pour more money into compute and data and unleash an energy plan to support the A.I. boom, among other recommendations. Wang is one of the world’s youngest self-made billionaires. He was born and raised in Los Alamos, New Mexico, as the son of weapons physicists who worked at the famed Los Alamos National Laboratory. After a brief stint in Silicon Valley working for fintech company Addepar and Q&A website Quora, Wang began studying machine learning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before dropping out to establish Scale AI, which uses contract work to provide troves of accurately labeled data for A.I. training efforts. Scale AI was valued at $13.8 billion last year and counts the U.S. Department of Defense and OpenAI among its clients. Wang is longtime friends with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, having roomed with him during the Covid-19 pandemic. He launched Scale AI in 2016 within Y Combinator, the startup accelerator formerly helmed by Altman. Scale AI also recently partnered with the Center for A.I. Safety to release “Humanity’s Last Exam,” which they described as the toughest benchmark test yet for A.I. systems. While no model has been able to achieve more than 10 percent on the test so far, Wang said DeepSeek’s new reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1, has topped the leaderboard. “Their model is actually the top-performing, or roughly on par with the best American models,” he told CNBC. Due to tough GPU export controls in China, DeepSeek claims it has managed to create powerful models with far less computing power compared to American systems. DeepSeek-V3, the model released in December, was trained on around 2,000 A.I. chips from Nvidia (NVDA), according to DeepSeek researchers. Meta (META)’s Llama 3.1 model, for reference, was trained on 16,000 GPUs. Wang isn’t convinced. “The Chinese labs have more H100s than people think,” he said, referring to a type of Nvidia GPU that isn’t legally available in China. “My understanding is that DeepSeek has about 50,000 H100s—which they can’t talk about, obviously, because it is against the export controls that the United States has put in place.” To continue pushing its frontier models, the U.S. must unlock more computational capacity and infrastructure, according to Wang, who believes the A.I. market is on track to be worth $1 trillion once A.I. achieves the benchmark of artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). While A.I. leaders have offered up various timelines and meanings for A.G.I., Wang’s definition refers to systems that “could basically be a remote worker in the most capable way,” an achievement he believes will be accomplished in the next two to four years.

Bitcoin has surged since the election of U.S. president Donald Trump last year, soaring on hopes Trump could be about to trigger a bitcoin game-changer. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has rocketed past $100,000 per bitcoin, hitting a fresh all-time high ahead of Trump's inauguration as the chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock reveals sovereign wealth funds are exploring bitcoin. Now, as the Federal Reserve grapples with a fresh dollar crisis, the chief executive of major bitcoin and crypto exchange Coinbase has predicted when the bitcoin price could flip gold's $18 trillion. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong has issued a huge bitcoin price prediction, forecasting ... [+] bitcoin could flip gold by 2030. "Any country with gold reserves should be holding at least 11% of that amount in bitcoin reserves," Armstrong posted to X in response to criticism of Trump's plan for a national bitcoin reserve. "And I believe in the next five to 10 years bitcoin's market cap will likely surpass gold. So these reserves should grow to exceed gold." This week, Trump has followed through on his campaign promises to make overhauling crypto policy one of his administration's priorities, ordering the creation of a cryptocurrency working group tasked with proposing new regulations and exploring the creation of a national cryptocurrency stockpile. The group will "evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile... potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts." The U.S. currently holds more than 200,000 bitcoin worth around $21 billion along with some smaller cryptocurrencies that have been seized by law enforcement. In December, Trump confirmed he plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve. "We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead," Trump told CNBC. In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold's $18 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. Armstrong has endorsed the idea of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, calling it part of a plan that will "bring economic freedom to the world" that comes at a "pivotal moment" in history. "The next global arms race will be in the digital economy, not space," Armstrong wrote. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed to a record high in 2025, triggering a wave of bullish bitcoin price ... [+] predictions. "Bitcoin could be as foundational to the global economy as gold and will become central to national security in a world where holdings of bitcoin can shift the balance of power among nation states. Governments will race to build strategic bitcoin reserves, securing and uplifting their national economies while those without will lose their footing in the digital age." Meanwhile, speaking to CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Armstrong predicted the bitcoin price will top "multiple millions" as the U.S. bitcoin reserve causes the "rest of the G20" to follow suit. "If the U.S. took that path, probably the rest of the G20 would follow," said. "I think bitcoin has a long way to go—it's going to be the new gold standard out there, but crypto is really much bigger than that too." One Community. Many Voices.

You can also use simple voice commands to control your Fire TV devices, set up daily routines and make your smart home even smarter. Want to try something with Alexa? You probably can -- you just need to know the right words to say. If you have an Echo at home and want to get the most out of Alexa, here are all the voice commands you should try. Alexa is set to get an AI overhaul. We saw Amazon demo its new AI-backed commands back in 2023, but the rollout of this big AI update has been pushed. There are several Reddit threads like this one, discussing how the "Let's chat" AI command isn't properly available yet, so all we can do right now is wait it out. Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs. This story is periodically updated.

Title: Is American Express (AXP) Among Billionaire Mario Gabelli’s Top Stock Picks?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire Mario Gabelli’s Top 15 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stands against other Billionaire Mario Gabelli’s top stock picks. Mario Gabelli is a legendary American investor, renowned for his expertise in value investing and his focus on media, telecommunications, and consumer goods. As the founder and CEO of GAMCO Investors, Gabelli has built a storied career, consistently delivering strong returns for investors while amassing significant wealth. He was born in 1942 in Italy to a family of modest means. His father was a schoolteacher, and the Gabelli family immigrated to the United States when Mario was a child. Settling in the Bronx, Gabelli became fluent in English while excelling academically. He attended Columbia Business School, where he earned his MBA. Gabelli’s early career began at Lyon, Lavey, and Bessemer, where he worked as a financial analyst before moving to Tudor Investment Corporation in the late 1960s. At Tudor, Gabelli developed a deep interest in media and entertainment stocks, recognizing that these sectors were undervalued and ripe for investment. Gabelli’s early years in finance provided him with a solid foundation in analyzing companies, market trends, and financial statements. In 1976, Gabelli founded Gabelli & Company — which would later become Gabelli Asset Management and then GAMCO Investors — with the goal of applying his value investing philosophy to select, often underappreciated companies. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Under Gabelli’s stewardship, the firm has delivered above-market returns, with Gabelli’s flagship Gabelli Equity Fund returning an average annualized return of 13% over several decades. Gabelli is an ardent advocate of value investing, a strategy pioneered by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. His approach emphasizes thorough analysis, buying companies at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, and holding them for the long term. One of Gabelli’s most notable achievements was his early recognition of the potential in media companies. He was one of the first investors to spot the potential of CBS, Time Warner, and Viacom, turning those investments into massive successes. Gabelli is particularly well-known for his focus on the telecommunications sectors as well. He has invested in companies like Comcast, Disney, and Liberty Media, often advocating for management changes and strategic restructuring to unlock value.

For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of GAMCO Investors at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up view of a payment terminal, capturing the sophistication of a payment network. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62 GAMCO Investors’ Stake: $148.5 million American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) provides payments and travel-related services. The following key aspects make this company a standout investment. To start with, in the third quarter of 2024, total card member spending increased by 6%, and card fee revenue growth accelerated to 18%. The company continued to attract large numbers of new premium card members with 3.3 million new card acquisitions while maintaining high retention rates, excellent credit performance, and expense discipline. Secondly, American Express (NYSE:AXP) has introduced new initiatives to support low-carbon communities, including the expansion of its carbon footprint tool for select corporate clients. Moreover, the company has announced new product updates and analytics enhancements to its digital cash flow management hub, American Express Business Blueprint, which would help small business card members understand their cash flow trends in a better way. Overall, AXP ranks 6th on our list of Billionaire Mario Gabelli’s top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AXP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AXP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: With 89% ownership in Halma plc (LON:HLMA), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Halma's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 48% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of Halma plc (LON:HLMA) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 89% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Last week’s 4.0% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 34%. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Halma, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Halma Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. Halma already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Halma's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Halma. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 4.8% of common stock, and FMR LLC holds about 3.1% of the company stock. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that Halma plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own UK£7.7m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Halma. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that Halma is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about... But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future. NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other top trending AI stocks on Wall Street. President Donald Trump has recently announced a private sector investment to build more AI data centers, marking yet another effort by the US government to stay ahead in the race for supremacy in artificial intelligence. A prominent player in the field has been OpenAI, the artificial intelligence startup known to have started the AI arms race in the first place. In its latest, OpenAI has recently previewed an AI agent that can carry out tasks on the web for users. This move seeks to enhance its chatbot amidst intensifying competition. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist Dubbed the “Operator”, the tool is powered by a model that allows it to interact with on-screen buttons, menus, and text fields. “This capability marks the next step in AI development, allowing models to use the same tools humans rely on daily and opening the door to a vast range of new applications”. OpenAI says Operator is “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you”. As such, companies are increasingly using agents like these to assist in tasks and execute actions without direct human intervention. Currently available to Pro users in the US, the Operator can perform numerous tasks, such as creating to-do lists or assisting in planning vacations. The company states that it eventually plans to expand the Operator to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and will be integrating Operator into ChatGPT. It also revealed how the tool currently faces trouble with some tasks, such as managing calendars and creating slideshows. “Operator is one of our first agents, which are AIs capable of doing work for you independently. You give it a task and it will execute it”. Based on trends in artificial intelligence, agents are the next big advancement in the AI field. Even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang agrees that they are. Artificial Intelligence agents are autonomous intelligent systems that can perform specific tasks without human intervention. “AI agents are going to get deployed. I think this year we’re going to see it take off”. According to him, areas such as software engineering, digital marketing, and customer service are the first where AI agents can add value. As for his company, it is already using AI agents in chip design. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Significantly high institutional ownership implies Greggs' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 18 shareholders own 51% of the company Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock If you want to know who really controls Greggs plc (LON:GRG), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 88% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by UK£126m. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 18% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as "smart money", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Greggs, which might have negative implications on individual investors. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Greggs. View our latest analysis for Greggs Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Greggs. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Greggs' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Greggs is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares outstanding. With 5.3% and 4.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Fiduciary Management, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 18 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Greggs plc in their own names. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own UK£2.0m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Greggs. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA, Financial) fell more than 3% on Friday as investors worried about growing competition from Japan's semiconductor companies; Japan's Advantest renewed its leadership in chip testing equipment. With advancements in generative AI pushing demand, the global market is now dominated by Advantest , where the U.S. rival Teradyne (TER, Financial) commands about 50%, according to sources. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. SoC testing tool revenue is expected to climb 32 percent to JPY 324 billion ($2.1 billion) by March 2025, says the company. For such advanced AI chip processes as chiplets and 3D packaging, highly accurate and efficient tools are essential to yield improvement. Advantest's fiscal year 2024 R&D investments came in at JPY 65.5 billion ($424.5 million), illustrating the importance that is placed on innovation by Advantest. Much greater profitability has been made possible through its R&D efficiency. Advantest CEO Douglas Lefever, seeing continued strong growth in AI chip demand, views the technology as positive for the industry. While Nvidia falls, that speaks to the changing market dynamic around evolving semiconductor technologies. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: An Irishwoman’s story of travelling abroad for cosmetic surgery

There’s something ironic about actor Demi Moore leaving this month’s Golden Globes ceremony with a statuette for her performance as the fading celebrity who succumbs to the ultimate anti-ageing injectable along with an award-ceremony goody bag containing a voucher for a $40,000 cellular facelift. Body-horror film The Substance and its terrifying message about the Faustian deal Moore’s character Elisabeth Sparkle makes to freeze time, may have made a visceral impression on audiences, but it’s unlikely to halt the rise of cosmetic surgery. According to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery’s annual global survey, both aesthetic and cosmetic procedures are growing year on year, with a 40 per cent increase over the past five years. Liposuction is the most common surgical procedure, followed by breast augmentation, eyelid surgery, abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) and rhinoplasty. While there are no official statistics for Ireland, Liz Dwyer, founder of the Future Beauty Show, a clinical and aesthetic beauty event for consumers, which will run at the RDS on March 1st and 2nd, believes “tweakments” – non-surgical treatments such as injectables, laser and bio-rejuvenations – are as prolific in this country as visits to the hairdresser. In Dwyer’s experience, the majority of both surgical and non-surgical procedures are not vanity-led. “Most of the time, men and women are trying to solve a problem and find a way to deal with something that upsets them. It could be a birthmark, acne, obesity or hair loss caused by anxiety,” she explains. For media professional Claire Craig, it was uneven breasts. She had been deeply unhappy with the irregularities in size and shape of one breast compared with the other for many years, but her insecurities were solidified in 2016 when she went to a well-known department store for a bra fitting. “I was essentially told I was deformed by the sales assistant who suggested that a surgeon could sort me out. I wiped away tears as I walked up the street,” she says. Despite feeling terrified at the prospect of surgery, by 2023 she decided “it’s now or never” so she had a breast augmentation at the Avoca Clinic in Wicklow. The mother-of-one went on to have liposuction on her thighs in November after diet and exercise failed to achieve the results she wanted. She describes the surgeries as life-changing. “I feel really emotional about it. Confidence is everything and feeling good in your own body helps your overall wellbeing,” she says. Craig was quoted €5,000 for liposuction in Ireland but paid half that at the Bangkok Hospital Siriroj in Thailand. Though still in the healing phase, she says she feels great and has no significant pain or problems, just mild fatigue and a little discomfort. She’s back at work now and back in the gym. While she can see some signs of healing and inch loss, it could be the end of February before the full results are visible. Two of Craig’s close friends have also had cosmetic surgery and she says it’s no longer thought of as unusual but is fairly common. Since she has had two procedures herself, I ask about the proverbial slippery slope. “I’m in a good place right now and I realise I can’t continue to do this. I’ve always been very passionate about nutrition and working out so I don’t think that’s a risk for me. Admittedly, when you see the results of surgery you think, ‘God, this is really good,’ but I would weigh that against the recovery time, antibiotics and medication.” Craig was fortunate to have the support of her 20-year-old daughter in Thailand and a childhood friend from Longford who travelled to Phuket from her home in Australia to have a breast augmentation at the same time. Dwyer says that for many people who choose to have surgery abroad, assuming that the surgery has gone as planned, the hardest part is not the surgery itself but the lack of emotional support afterwards. Thirty-six-year-old Lynn Mac travelled alone to Kaunas in Lithuania for a tummy tuck and arm lift in September last year. “I’ve had a lifelong battle with obesity,” she explains. “I’ve lost weight and put it back on over the years and when I finally went on a proper health kick and lost loads of weight, I was left with loose skin and stretch marks.” [ ‘They’ve got these alien features’: The rise of unregulated cosmetic procedures in IrelandOpens in new window ] A psychic medium by profession, Mac admits that although it goes against all common sense, her choice of clinic was based on intuition. “I came across BaltiClinic on Instagram and watched their work for a while, then I met with a surgeon and other staff in Dublin who’d travelled over from Lithuania to chat with prospective clients. They were lovely and I felt no pressure to book.” Mac was in theatre for 3½ hours and the most challenging aspect, she reveals, was being unable to stand up straight for a week afterwards. “I was groggy and my body felt tight when I came out of surgery. I hadn’t realised I would only very gradually be able to straighten up.” She did worry about how she would manage alone when she left the hospital, but her fears didn’t play out. “The hospital staff made sure I was looked after. They took care of all my journeys to and from the hotel, hospital and airport and I had constant contact with the surgeon’s assistant, who was incredible. My family was checking in the whole time too,” she says. The Leixlip native is so happy with the results that she has scheduled a thigh lift and adjustments to her back for later this year at the same clinic. “People argue you should stay in Ireland for cosmetic surgery, but what has Ireland got to offer? We’re not leaders in cosmetic surgery and then there’s the cost.” Mac paid €7,000 for an extended tummy tuck, lipo 360 and an arm lift. She says the same work could cost anything between €15,000 and €20,000 in Ireland. Dwyer agrees the difference in cost at home and abroad is considerable. Brazil is a case in point. “Filler will cost you about €50 there whereas it can cost five times that in Ireland. Every Brazilian I know travels home to stock up on tweakments,” she says. You see every single type of man coming in to get work done, from tradesmen treating the effects of sun damage to grandfathers getting Botox Ms Siún Murphy, consultant plastic surgeon at Dublin’s Blackrock Clinic, warns that patients need to be aware of the vast difference between clinics at home and abroad. “Some are regulated and adhere to modern surgical standards,” she explains, “but sadly many do not. Travelling abroad for surgery is not without its risks and issues, especially with regard to post-operative care. Many patients fly back after long anaesthetics and multiple procedures; all of that travel so soon after a general anaesthetic can compromise their recovery and risk clots. While having these procedures costs more at home, the post-operative care, which is almost more important than the procedures themselves, is all part of the operative package here.” Despite the financial incentive to go abroad, Monica Ivani chose to have her eye lift with Dr Murphy at Dublin’s Blackrock Clinic. Originally from Hungary, the 44-year-old explains that she had a heavily hooded eyelid since childhood. “I wouldn’t say it affected my confidence, but I’m a businesswoman; it’s part of my job to look the best I can.” Ivani, who owns MyBrows Permanent Makeup Academy in Stillorgan in Dublin, says she looks younger and fresher since the eye lift and has no visible scar. [ Cosmetic surgery tourism: Demi Moore’s new film shows what influencer videos won’t – the scalp infections and weeping woundsOpens in new window ] “The surgery took 20 minutes under local anaesthetic and I didn’t feel anything during or after. I had no side effects or bruising and just a little bit of swelling for a few days. You can see it all on my social media account.” Several of Ivani’s friends have had eye lifts in France and England. “Surgery abroad is so much cheaper, but I chose the Blackrock Clinic in case I had complications afterwards.” Ivani believes at least half of her clientele have had work done. “Europeans are a lot more open about the subject,” she says. “Irish people are very private, although that’s beginning to change. I’m very open about it. I think the eye lift was brilliant and I would recommend it to anyone.” Dwyer believes more transparency can only be a good thing. On her podcast Fess Up, she invites individuals in the public eye to get real about everything from mummy makeovers to colonics. “More honesty means greater awareness and this will raise industry standards for everyone.” While Ivani describes herself as “very pro-plastic surgery”, she doesn’t believe in going overboard. “I don’t want to change, I want to look natural and like the best version of myself. After 40, skin becomes looser and signs of ageing become more obvious. I would like to age gracefully – I don’t mind wrinkles, it’s all part of life – but you can’t let yourself go completely.” At 24, Patrick Blue has no need to worry about the ravages of time, yet the creative make-up artist and social media manager has had several aesthetic treatments in cosmetic clinics in Dublin, from lip filler and mesotherapy (injections under the skin to promote loss of fat) to Botox and dermaplaning (scraping off dead skin cells with a scalpel). In November 2022, he had a septoplasty and rhinoplasty in Istanbul at a cost of €2,400; this included surgery, accommodation and transfers. His first tweakment was lip filler at age 18. He thought it would be a fun thing to do with his mum so he treated them both. It was her first time too – and, as it turned out, her last. Blue says she enjoyed the experience but decided needles weren’t for her. The Enniscorthy native reveals all of his peers are investing in their skin now, “especially when it comes to basic stuff like Botox, fillers and boosters”. Although by law in Ireland Botox can only be administered by a doctor, dentist or registered nurse, in recent years, with the increased demand for such procedures, a wider number of health practitioners are diversifying to cater to the growing market. He adds: “Treatments aren’t that expensive any more. One ml of lip filler is €250 and Botox can range from €240 per unit.” The septoplasty was to repair a breathing problem and a blockage in one of his nostrils, but he decided that while he was having it done, he’d have a “minor fix” on his nose. “I was happy with my nose shape, but I thought it could be improved,” he says. Blue spent three years researching clinics before he decided on the Memorial Bahçelievler Hospital. “I had no pain at all after the surgery and the next day I enjoyed a three-hour boat cruise around Istanbul,” he says. Blue has been creating social media content for Dublin aesthetic clinics for the past five years and he says it’s not only common to see mums and daughters attending together but wives accompanying their husbands. “You see every single type of man coming in to get work done, from tradesmen treating the effects of sun damage to grandfathers getting Botox because they want to look good in christening photos. Men are much more conscious of their skin these days.” It’s Halloween night 2024. From beyond the glass at terminal two in Dublin Airport, the city skyline is alight with fireworks – all vision, no sound, the best kind. First stop Dubai; final destination: Phuket, Thailand. Phuket airport is heaving with travellers. Once we get through a long and humid immigration queue, it’s on to the hotel. We stay at Ratana Hotel Rassada, about 20 minutes outside Phuket Old Town. The hotel, which has a 20-metre pool and incredibly friendly staff, costs €30 per night with breakfast included. At Bangkok Hospital Siriroj I meet their wonderful client manager Nokky, who I have been corresponding with over email for several months. On the fourth floor, where the elective surgery consultations take place, I am brought through a series of tests, including X-rays, blood pressure and cardiac checks before being introduced to Dr Jib, who will do my surgery. I have chosen to have Vaser liposuction on my inner thighs. I was quoted €5,500 at home; in Thailand it’s €2,500. The surgery is scheduled for November 5th but pushed back to November 7th when Dr Jib hears I did not stop taking my fish oils as instructed (which can affect blood clotting and bruising). To be safe, we need to wait a few more days until they have left my system. The driver takes me back to the hotel where I feel reassured and impressed by the experience I have just had. Three free days until my surgery so it’s time to explore! Post-surgery, no swimming is allowed as the risk of infection is too high, so it’s time to enjoy Thailand’s beautiful coastal areas. The day of my surgery arrives. I have been fasting from midnight. When my driver collects me at 8am, I take a small overnight bag. While staying overnight is not always necessary, it’s a measure of care given here and reassuring. I meet Dr Jib and see him change from medical maestro to artist as he applies his permanent marker to the areas he will operate on on my body. I am then taken by a nurse to be checked into my private room. The room is bright, white and airy, with two beds. A companion is welcome to stay overnight with you if you request it. It feels like a five-star hotel, with luxury branded toiletries, a stocked fridge and waterfall shower. I feel a little giddy when I step out on the balcony and take in the leafy green garden views. I’m told to begin getting ready and change into a hospital gown – the procedure is scheduled for 11am. [ ‘For many people, plastic surgery is not about vanity at all’Opens in new window ] No nerves till now but they do start to kick in. I feel vulnerable, wearing just a hospital gown, in a foreign country in a strange bed. I am taken in the lift by the medical team to the fifth floor. While the other floors are all quite floral and dreamy, when the fifth floor sealed door is opened, the air is heavier. The faces, while still friendly, have the edge of being a little more serious, which both alarms and reassures me at the same time. I am moved from trolley to operating table. It’s a hive of activity and bright lights, with six or seven people in the room. I feel a bit queasy when I see the surgical instruments being prepared, so I turn my head to look at the black, glossy bulk of the Vaser liposuction machine ready for action. The theatre doors swing open and Dr Jib is scrubbed up and in the room ready for action. He greets me kindly and continues to prep. Next up, the anaesthetist, a man with kind eyes, enters the room. He holds my hand and introduces himself as Peter. We chat and he tells me I’m lovely and friendly and I start to cry, a little overwhelmed with emotion and nerves. He says he is going to put me to sleep, that I’m not to worry about a thing. An injection in my left arm makes me feel tingly. There’s a mask on my face and in less than 90 seconds I am under the sedation spell. It’s nearly 3pm when I wake up back in my hospital room. Dr Jib is at my bedside with a nurse to welcome me back to consciousness with the good news that the operation was a success. “Nearly 700cc from each side,” he says proudly and with the look of man who maybe isn’t used to seeing thighs made of such sustainable stuff. I immediately imagine two cartons of Avonmore pink milk as a reference, and nod in agreement that that’s a fairly impressive amount. Post surgery, I have been dressed in a compression garment, which is essentially a pair of high-waisted, extra-tight leggings which I am to wear day and night for six weeks for best results. My legs are elevated and I am given a device with a button for pain and a button to call a nurse if needed. Despite having zero pain – just minor discomfort – I take advantage of the morphine button and float into a restful, recuperative sleep. I am woken with a menu to choose my meals. I opt for the salmon and mashed potato, which tastes both comforting and nourishing. I sleep well all night and I am nearly a little sad when it’s time to be discharged the next day. It was so lovely to be minded. The nurses help me dress, and I am given antibiotics and painkillers to take back to hotel. I am on my feet and moving slowly and carefully. Client manager Nokky is there to check in on me and make sure I have everything I need. I arrive back to the hotel and sit by the pool with friends to update them on all the news. I’m still a little queasy and suddenly have to lunge to a bin and vomit. I retire to my room after that. While recovering in paradise is lovely, it wouldn’t be possible without air-con. In the days post surgery, I have minor discomfort but no pain. I tire quickly and am swollen (zero results visible yet). I am also on antibiotics so alcohol is out too. The day before my flight home I have my final check-up with Dr Jib. He changes dressings and inspects healing, checks all vitals etc. I am still very bruised and swollen and I am told I must be patient with the results. I feel lighter but am so badly bruised I feel sad – the post-surgery low mood is a real thing. It could be Christmas when swelling will really diminish. My anxiety has been building about the long flight home. Dr Jib writes me a note for the airline and I am to be given an aisle seat to be able to walk freely on flight. The departures area at Phuket airport is so busy it’s bordering on chaotic – this is my lowest moment on my trip. Boarding the flight takes longer than expected and I have to stand for a long period of time in a jostling queue, which I had not anticipated. I had not requested assistance or booked any priority boarding. I would not make this mistake again. I am home for several weeks now and back at work. I became fatigued very quickly for the first 10 days but saw a return to normal energy levels after that. Walking and light household duties are fine but no gym/running for a few more weeks. Still very much in the healing phase but I have started to see some results, which is encouraging. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Jan. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

January 24, 2025 17:26 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Jan. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) securities between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until March 25, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. Captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713 (D.N.J.), the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit charges Novo Nordisk and certain of Novo Nordisk’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-novo-nordisk-a-s-class-action-lawsuit-nvo.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Novo Nordisk, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit further alleges that on December 20, 2024, defendants published headline results from their REDEFINE-1 CagriSema obesity trial, disclosing that “[t]he REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial” and that “[a]fter 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg.” On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 18%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit.

Title: Thinking about Getting a Costco Membership? Here's How Much You Can Save

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Costco offers deals on bulk groceries, home essentials and more. But exactly how much can you save? I did the math. A Costco membership can save you more than $1,000 yearly in groceries alone. Groceries are the biggest ongoing expense for most families after housing, and they've seen an annoying uptick since the pandemic and all its supply chain chaos. In fact, the price of food rose 25% from 2019 to 2023, according to the US Department of Agriculture. One way to combat high supermarket prices is buying in bulk and nowhere is that more easily done that at Costco -- if you have one in your town or city. At Costco, groceries are packaged in larger quantities and sold at cheaper per-pound prices, meaning you can save major dough as long as you have the space to store a 50-pack of paper towels or a 20-pound bag of rice. Shopping at Costco also typically means fewer trips to the store, which translates to less gas. To see exactly how much money you can save by buying bulk groceries from Costco, I decided to price out a grocery list at the wholesale club and a more typical grocery store. After running the numbers, it's possible to save over $1,000 in one year by shopping at Costco instead of a supermarket. Below is a breakdown of how I reached that figure. (And if you get a Costco Executive membership, you could save even more.) Using grocery list templates available online, I assembled a list of 25 typical, staple grocery items that are suitable for longer storage, either in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer. This ruled out most fresh produce with some exceptions. If you're hosting a large gathering, buying produce in bulk may be worthwhile. Bulk shopping doesn't mean buying a year's worth of groceries all at once, but I didn't include anything that wouldn't hold up well for at least a month, with the notion that bulk grocery shopping can be done less often. Bulk buying also requires spending more upfront, which is why Costco's per-item total is considerably higher than Stop & Shop's. Assuming either bi-weekly or monthly consumption of those staple grocery items for a household of one or two people, I came up with the approximate yearly consumption for each. I chose Stop & Shop to represent a conventional grocery retailer, as it's largely considered to be a quality store with median prices, and Costco to represent bulk buying, as its Kirkland Signature products have a bit of a following in their own right -- Costco is the Trader Joe's of the bulk set, for sure. Unless a national brand is otherwise indicated, I used Stop & Shop's SB brand, or the least expensive name-brand product for a given item, to compare to Costco's Kirkland Signature brand. For the Stop & Shop items, coming up with the yearly price for each item was a simple matter of multiplying by 26 for bi-weekly consumption, or 12 for monthly consumption. For Costco's items, I scaled the prices accordingly based on whatever package size Costco offers to indicate a yearly cost for the same amount of a given item. If you can afford the freezer space, buying meat in bulk will save you big money over the course of a year. Since I was primarily interested in food cost savings, I didn't factor in cleaning supplies, paper products or other items, but you can safely assume these also amount to big saving potential over the year when bought in bulk. Also, since my calculations were based on a small household, the bigger your household, the bigger the savings. Costco requires a membership to take advantage of its bulk savings and low-cost signature brands. A basic membership costs $65 a year and is valid at all locations. Read more about the different Costco membership options. The economics of buying in bulk is simple: The more you buy of something at one time, the less it costs per count or unit of weight. Producers, distributors and retailers are able to offer lower prices this way not only because bulk items often require less packaging, but also because for them it's a sure sale over a potential sale -- they'd rather have your money now, even at a discount, than parsed out over a period of time. Shelf-stable items including cereal, sauces and coffee make up some of the biggest savings when buying in bulk. Given this particular grocery list, buying in bulk would allow you to save over $1,000 during the course of a year, representing a 33% savings overall over conventional groceries. (In today's economy, it is worth mentioning that you also save gas money with fewer trips to the store.) In a few cases, the Stop & Shop item ended up being the cheaper option: organic milk, carrots, potatoes and frozen salmon filets, for example. In all of these cases, there wasn't a huge size difference between the conventional and bulk items. Milk is an especially good example, as it's still offered in a larger quantity at Costco, but there's only so much of it you can buy at one time without risking it spoiling, and so the bulk offering is comparatively modest. Costco also doesn't have a Kirkland brand offering of organic milk, whereas Stop & Shop does. The savings for bulk fresh produce were not as significant as pantry staples and shelf-stable groceries. Generally speaking, the larger the scale on the bulk item, the larger the savings. If you buy a 40-ounce quantity of Cheerios, for example, rather than the 12 ounces you get in a typical box, they become nearly 75% cheaper. Buying 25 pounds of white rice all at once instead of 2 pounds at a time saves you 60%. With at least a grand in savings available yearly for just a portion of your grocery list, even if you need to buy additional home storage to accommodate it, the verdict is clear: Bulk grocery shopping is well worth the effort. Some of the biggest savings by percentage come from shelf-stable and pantry items including chips, crackers, jarred sauce, rice and whole-bean coffee. These items are typically easier to store and less likely to spoil or deteriorate in quality. Buying pantry items in bulk from a discount grocer such as Costco represents a clear and risk-free strategy for saving money on your grocery bill over the course of a year. If you're a Costco shopper, make sure you check out how to maximize your Costco savings, and how much you can save with a Costco Executive membership. And for more We Do the Math, check out how much you can save by shopping at Trader Joe's compared to other grocery stores, and if it's cheaper to buy meal kits than groceries.

You are hereby notified that the class action lawsuit Changyeon Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, et al. (Case No. 2:25-cv-00713) has been commenced in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

Levi, Esq. either via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. There is no cost or obligation to you. According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. If you suffered a loss in NVO securities, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

President Donald Trump flipped the script on one of the market's biggest worries about his presidency this week — his plan to levy steep tariffs on imports— and it's sent stocks climbing to new records as concerns about trade policy fade for the time being. The week's developments represent a considerable shift in the market narrative, as traders have fretted over the potential inflationary impact of Trump's tariff plan for months. In early January, stocks sold off and bond yields spiked on reports that Trump was considering using his emergency powers to bring tariffs early on in his presidency. The message was clear: The market believed tariffs would stoke inflation, which could lead to interest rates staying higher for longer and crush hopes that looser monetary policy would extend the bull market into its third year. But Trump's orders in the first days of his presidency seem to have turned that narrative upside down, with markets getting a major leg-up this week on optimism for economic growth over the next four years. Stocks have climbed steadily higher since Trump's inauguration, when the president promised that tariffs would lead to "massive amounts of money" pouring into the US. The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Thursday, recovering from a sell-off at the start of the year as traders digest a slew of orders and policy announcements from the White House. "Now investors are focused on, okay, the executive orders are coming through, he's serious about deregulation, he's serious about getting the tax cuts," Nancy Tengler, the chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, told Business Insider. "Those are important elements for the market, because — whether you agree with him or not, that's never the issue. The issue is the uncertainty. And so it looks like we're going to have a regular order of business and things are going to chug along," she added. The bond market also appears to have recovered some of its losses. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury crept up slightly this week but is down about 20 basis points from its peak earlier in the month. The yield was hovering around 4.6% Friday after approaching 5% a few weeks ago, a level that has historically been a threshold for a sell-off in stocks when crossed. Investor sentiment, meanwhile, is up sharply. According to the AAII's latest Investor Sentiment Survey, 43% of investors said they were bullish on stocks over the next six months, up from 25% who felt that way the prior week. "People look excited about what appears to be a real pro-growth agenda," Paul Stanley, the chief investment officer of Granite Bay Wealth Management told BI in an interview, adding that investors likely have put their worries for inflation on hold. "On the whole, the market is telling us that they believe his policies are likely to be better for growth than they're negative on the other end." In other words, the president's flurry of executive actions this week helped steer the market's attention toward higher growth and away from potential threats of a still-uncertain trade policy. Trump signed an executive order declaring a "national energy emergency," lowering guardrails to increase fracking and oil production in the US. He announced a $500 billion deal between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build more AI infrastructure, an initiative he said would create more than 100,000 jobs in the US. That announcement sparked a pronounced move up among the market's top AI tech stocks midweek. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, he said he would demand that "interest rates drop immediately" and ask Saudi Arabia to help bring down oil prices. On Thursday, he signed an executive order related to crypto, reviving bullishness. While the order was light on big developments related to some of the most bullish ideas floating around the crypto sphere—like the establishment of a national bitcoin stockpile—industry insiders say they feel it is a step in the right direction toward more robust government support for digital assets.

Amazon’s decision to shut down seven distribution centres in Quebec, affecting over 1,900 jobs, has sparked sharp criticism from Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, François-Philippe Champagne. In a strongly worded letter addressed to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Champagne expressed disappointment over the closures and urged the company to reconsider, shared the minister on Thursday evening on X. “When Amazon entered the Canadian market, it did so recognizing the value of Canada’s exceptional workers,” Champagne wrote. He pointed out the closures undermine Amazon’s commitment to being “Earth’s best employer” and called the decision inconsistent with the company’s values. The closures come after Amazon’s Laval distribution centre became the first in North America to unionize, raising speculation that decision could be linked to its resistance to unionized labour. Champagne argued that Amazon’s Quebec facilities play a vital role in the company’s supply chain, ensuring quick delivery across the province and contributing significantly to the local economy. He added that the layoffs would have ripple effects on communities, highlighting the importance of Amazon’s business partnership with Canada. “It is not too late to reconsider your decision,” Champagne urged, adding that such layoffs raise concerns about Amazon’s long-term commitment to the Canadian market. The letter called for a review of Amazon’s relationship with the Canadian government and extended an invitation to discuss the matter further. With Parliament currently prorogued by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and a spring federal election looming, Champagne’s words don’t mean much. But at least it makes his constituents feel better. In an emailed statement to iPhone in Canada on Wednesday, Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait said, “Following a recent review of our Quebec operations, we’ve seen that returning to a third-party delivery model supported by local small businesses, similar to what we had until 2020, will allow us to provide the same great service and even more savings to our customers over the long run.” She added, “This decision wasn’t made lightly, and we’re offering impacted employees a package that includes up to 14 weeks’ pay after facilities close and transitional benefits, like job placement resources.” In a nutshell, Laval workers unionized and Amazon appealed to the labour board, citing the vote didn’t recognize worker rights, since the vote was not by secret ballot, but rather by signing cards. Amazon lost the appeal–and now they have pulled out of Quebec.

Title: Trump’s $500B Stargate A.I. Project: What Will It Build and Does It Actually Have the Money?

On Tuesday (Jan. 21), President Donald Trump announced an A.I. initiative called Stargate. During a press conference at the White House attended by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank (SFTBF) CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, the returning President told reporters the initiative will invest $500 billion—equivalent to almost 2 percent of the annual U.S. economic output—over the next four years to bolster A.I. infrastructure in the U.S. and help the nation gain an edge over China. Trump estimates the Stargate will create 100,000 jobs. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. OpenAI will lead the project alongside Oracle, SoftBank and the UAE government’s tech investment Arm, MGX. Other key players in the tech alliance include Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Arm. Seemingly a nod to Roland Emmerich’s 1994 sci-fi film “Stargate,” which explores the concept of intergalactic portals—Stargate will develop “physical and virtual infrastructure” to power advanced A.I. systems, according to the President. The project is launching with an immediate $100 billion funding commitment to address critical challenges in A.I. infrastructure, such as the need for cutting-edge data centers across the U.S. and the electricity to power them. The partnership capitalizes on OpenAI’s established ties with Nvidia, which began in 2016, and a newer collaboration with Oracle, leveraging the company’s expertise in data centers and enterprise analytics. SoftBank’s financial resources further bolster the project, but details remain scarce. Nvidia and Oracle didn’t respond to requests for comment by Observer. Stargate’s first data center, which will span one million square feet, is already under construction in Abilene, Texas, Ellison said at this week’s press conference, adding that “more will be built” across other U.S. locations. Tech leaders not involved in the project are skeptical about its viability, especially given its massive size. Elon Musk, who has been vocal in his criticism of OpenAI, challenged the viability of the project’s funding. “They don’t actually have the money,” Musk wrote on X. “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.” Altman responded to Musk’s doubt by offering to show him the ongoing construction of the data centers. “Want to come visit the first site already under way?,” Altman wrote in a retort on X. “I realize what is great for the country isn’t always what’s optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you’ll mostly put America first.” Musk also questioned Altman’s newfound support for Trump, citing his anti-Trump tweets during the 2016 Presidential election. He shared a screenshots of Altman’s 2021 post where the OpenAI CEO expressed gratitude to LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman for funding legal efforts to preventing Trump’s re-election in 2020. In a post yesterday, Altman said watching the President more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him. I’m not going to agree with him on everything, but I think he will be incredible for the country in many ways!” Big tech companies are racing to build their own data centers. Amazon’s AWS recently pledged $11 billion to expand data centers in Georgia; Meta announced a $10 billion A.I. hub in Louisiana; and Musk’s xAI recently built a data center in Memphis. At the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed Musk’s remarks on Stargate, reaffirming the company’s $80 billion commitment to expanding A.I. infrastructure globally. “All I know is, I’m good for my $80 billion,” Nadella said. “And all this money is not about hyping A.I., but is about building useful things for the real world!” He commented under Musk’s post on X. Despite the tensions, experts see the project as a necessary step to secure the U.S.’s leadership in the global A.I. race. “Stargate Project is the foundation we need to power the next generation of A.I. agents,” Claudionor Coelho, chief A.I. officer of the cloud security company Zscaler, told Observer. Matt Zeiler, founder and CEO of the deep learning and A.I. lifecycle platform Clarifai, said for Stargate to be truly successful, it must make a mark across multiple domains. He pointed to the rapid progress of foundational A.I. models in fields ranging from protein folding to patient communication. “In areas where A.I. architectures like transformers are already proving effective or where data can be easily tokenized, Stargate has the potential to be a game changer,” he told Observer.

Title: Washington Post editor says newspaper ‘utterly lost its soul’ after ‘equating’ Biden, Trump pardons
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/media/washington-post-editor-david-maraniss-says-newspaper-utterly-lost-its-soul/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T17:43:14Z
Full Content:
A longtime associate editor at the Washington Post criticized his own newspaper for an editorial that blasted both President Trump and his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for having “both abused their pardon powers” and “setting dangerous precedents.” David Maraniss, who has spent nearly five decades at the Washington Post, took to social media on Wednesday and bemoaned the fact that his employer “has utterly lost its soul.” “The Washington Post editorial this morning essentially equating Biden’s questionable pardons with Trump’s outrageous Jan. 6 pardons was unconscionable,” Maraniss wrote on the Bluesky microblogging platform on Wednesday. “The newspaper I’ve been part of for 48 years has utterly lost its soul.” Maraniss, who has written biographies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, referred to an editorial titled: “Pardons from Biden and Trump flout the rule of law.” “President Joe Biden started the trouble by issuing preemptive pardons for five family members as well as former members of his administration,” the newspaper’s editorial board wrote. “His rash action opens the door for future presidents to likewise immunize their families and staffs from merely theoretical prosecution by their successors — as though future presidents should be considered enemies whose actions must be defended against.” In the next paragraph, the editorial calls out Trump for pardoning those convicted for their roles in the rioting at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. “His reckless handout risks emboldening militias and others to commit future acts of barbarity in support of political aims. When such violence is tolerated, it happens more often,” the editorial read. The New York Post has sought comment from the Washington Post. Maraniss on Thursday told Status newsletter that it “disheartens” him “to see what is happening in this era of leadership” — a reference to owner Jeff Bezos. Bezos, the Amazon founder, has so far ignored a request from more than 400 of the newspaper’s staffers to visit the newsroom in the wake of an exodus of talent sparked by the decision to spike an endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris. A large chunk of the newspaper’s left-leaning readership was so outraged by the move that a reported 250,000 subscribers canceled their memberships. “People are in utter despair,” a Washington Post staffer told Status. The newsletter said Washington Post employees found it “confounding … as to why Bezos insists on maintaining ownership of the newspaper.” “While he once seemed to take pride in owning it, and perhaps even enjoyed that the outlet served as a bulwark against Trump in his first term, that no longer seems to be the case,” Oliver Darcy wrote in Status. The Post has sought comment from Bezos. In recent weeks, the Washington Post has parted ways with several high-profile reporters and editors who have decamped for other media outlets. Philip Rucker, the highly regarded national editor, left for CNN, while longtime opinion columnist and Trump-basher Jennifer Rubin resigned to join Substack. Ann Telnaes, the newspaper’s cartoonist, resigned after the publication refused to print her cartoon mocking Bezos and other tech moguls as being too subservient to Trump. Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, two national political reporters, left for The Atlantic while investigative political reporter Josh Dawsey quit to join the Wall Street Journal. Morale at the Washington Post has been further damaged by recent layoffs of staffers on the business side. Management at the newspaper has also laid down the law and told staffers that they are welcome to submit their resignation if they refuse to return to the office five days per week. Advertisement

Saturday, 25 Jan 2025 OTTAWA, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is threatening to review its commercial relationship with Amazon after the online retail giant decided to close all its distribution centers in Quebec, local media reported Friday. Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne, expressing his strong disappointment, demanded that Amazon "immediately" reconsider the decision, according to the report. Amazon said that it would cease operations in the French-speaking province over the next two months, turning back to the third-party model it had until 2020 for package deliveries. As such, at least 1,700 regular employees in Quebec and 250 temporary-seasonal workers would lose their jobs, said the report. "This is not the way business is done in Canada," said Champagne on his social media account, stating that the "large and sudden layoffs are cause for concern." Amazon denied that the decision was made following the unionization of 200 employees last spring at one of the warehouses, according to the report. Thank you for your report!

Title: Texas Asks Wall Street Firms for Details About DEI Efforts

Texas and nine other Republican-led states are ratcheting up pressure on Wall Street’s diversity programs, asking firms about their policies on hiring and supplier selections as the Trump administration moves to gut DEI. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on Thursday to the firms saying they appear to “unlawfully advance discriminatory” diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and demanded they respond to a series of questions about their programs. He said the companies may have breached their fiduciary duties by pursuing an “ulterior political motive or agenda.” The letter was sent to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and money manager BlackRock Inc. “You appear to have embraced race- and sex-based quotas and to have made business and investment decisions based not on maximizing shareholder and asset value, but in the furtherance of political agendas,” Paxton said in a letter obtained by Bloomberg. Paxton gave the firms 45 days to respond to the questions. “Before pursuing legal action, we are extending to each of you an opportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,” he wrote. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment, while BlackRock and the other banks haven’t provided a response. The letter comes after Trump, in his second day in office, ordered federal contractors to affirm they don’t “engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.” He directed government agencies to draw up a list of publicly traded companies for potential investigations into compliance violations. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs’ chief executive officers said on Wednesday that they will continueto focus on efforts to promote DEI in their workforces and customer bases. “We’re going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,” JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon said. The attorneys general cited pledges and goals made and set by finance firms since 2021 to bolster hiring of women and minorities. For example, JPMorgan pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024 and Goldman set a goal of spending more than $1 billion on diverse vendors. Corporate America ramped up its diversity efforts in the wake of the MeToo movement and the 2020 death of George Floyd that sparked nationwide unrest. In November, Paxton led a move to sue BlackRock, Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by using climate investing strategies to suppress coal production. BlackRock said the suggestion that it invested money in companies with the goal of harming them “is baseless and defies common sense.” In Thursday’s letter, Paxton also asked firms about their net zero emissions commitments and use of shareholder votes and conversations with companies to shift away from fossil fuels. For instance, the attorneys general asked BlackRock for details about communications it had with Climate Action 100+, an environmental group, and reasons for backing shareholder proposals focused on climate change. They also asked banks for information related to the steps they have taken to meet net zero goals. Financial firms, including the six cited by Paxton, have quit climate groups since early last month. The attorneys general that joined Paxton in sending the letter to the banks and BlackRock include those from Utah, Iowa, Indiana and Alabama. Topics Texas

Title: Trump's Stargate AI project backed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank is taking shape: Here's what we know

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. One of the Trump White House's first big announcements aligned itself with the artificial intelligence boom. In a splashy announcement on his second day in office, President Trump told Americans that a new $500 billion project — backed by SoftBank (SFTBY), Oracle (ORCL), and OpenAI — would generate “ over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately.” The project created a company called Stargate, which said in Tuesday's announcement it would “begin deploying $100 billion immediately" starting with data centers in Texas and spend an additional $400 billion over the next four years. Trump called the project, "a resounding declaration of confidence in America's potential under a new president." Microsoft (MSFT), AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and British chip designer Arm (ARM) were named as “key initial technology partners” by Stargate. The stocks of all companies involved soared, with Oracle and Nvidia rising 7% and 4%, respectively, the day after the announcement. But these early announcements have been followed by social media feuds featuring Elon Musk, questions about funding, and rival announcements about AI investments slated for this year. Trump's close ally, Elon Musk, took aim at Stargate’s backers on his social media platform X shortly after the announcement. Responding to a post from OpenAI about the project, he wrote, "They don’t actually have the money," adding, "SoftBank has well under $10B secured." Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, wrote back, “Wrong, as you surely know.” OpenAI has raised nearly $17 billion in the past two years and opened up a $4 billion credit line with various banks, though the company said it expected to lose $5 billion in 2024 while generating only $3.7 billion in revenue. OpenAI would need to raise an additional $19 billion to fund Stargate, according to The Information. A person familiar with Stargate refuted Musk's claims, telling Yahoo Finance that the project is indeed prepared to immediately deploy the initial $100 billion investment, noting that SoftBank had $24 billion in cash as of its most recent quarterly earnings. The Financial Times, citing unnamed sources, reported this week that Stargate has not yet secured its required funding, will receive no government financing, and will only serve OpenAI once completed. So far, only about 4% of Americans report using AI daily in their workplaces, though almost all Americans use AI-enabled products in their daily lives, often without realizing it. Then there’s the question of whether the project will hold true to Trump’s jobs promise, as data centers typically employ fewer than 100 people. Apple’s (AAPL) $1.3 billion data center project in Iowa, for example, committed to employing just 50 people in permanent positions, according to a Forbes investigation. All the while, critics say nondisclosure agreements between data centers and local officials mean residents are often left in the dark about the colossal buildings in their backyards driving up their utility bills. And some lawmakers argue that tax breaks for data centers aren’t worth the cost. Bloomberg reported this week that the first data center associated with Stargate in Abilene, Texas, will employ just 57 people at an average wage of $57,600 per year. On the heels of the Stargate announcement, Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post Friday that Meta (META) will spend between $60 billion and $65 billion in 2025, far higher than the estimated spending of $38 billion to $40 billion in 2024 it disclosed to investors back in October. Wall Street analysts had expected Meta's capital expenditures to tally closer to $51 billion this year, according to analysts tracked by Bloomberg. Much of Meta's spending would go into building a 2-gigawatt data center “that is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” Zuckerberg said. Two gigawatts is enough energy to power 700 electric vehicles for a full year. To be sure, proponents argue that the data centers have ripple effects on local economies. “Each direct job in the U.S. data center industry helps to create 7.4 ancillary jobs on average throughout the U.S. economy,” commercial real estate firm CBRE wrote in a report last year.

Title: Stripe ruffles feathers as accidental ‘cartoon duck’ sent to laid-off staffers

An image accidentally sent to laid-off Stripe staffers shows their communications team might have just been winging it. The payment processing platform accidentally sent an image of a cartoon duck in emails to employees notifying them of their termination, The Post has learned. On Monday, Stripe – whose customers include Amazon, Alaska Airlines, Blockchain.com and Slack – announced it was laying off 300 employees, or approximately 3.5% of its workforce. The impacted staffers are mostly in product, engineering and operations roles, according to a leaked memo. These workers received emails with an attached image labeled “US-Non-California Duck” showing a fluffy yellow cartoon bird. Employees took to Blind, an anonymous site where corporate employees can share grievances, to make light of the duck-up. “Never liked it when someone put a duck on my Jeep…this would have sent me over the edge,” one Blind user registered as a Stripe employee wrote. A Stripe spokesperson confirmed that the duck images were accidentally sent to laid-off staffers, and that impacted employees received notices with the incorrect termination dates, as well. Business Insider earlier reported news of the leaked emails. “I apologize for the error and any confusion it caused,” Rob McIntosh, Stripe’s chief people officer, said in an email to employees. “Corrected and full notifications have since been sent to all impacted Stripes.” In a separate email, McIntosh told Stripe staffers that the company is still hoping to grow its workforce by 17% to about 10,000 employees by the end of the year. The tech startup, which launched in 2011, has suffered layoffs in the past. Stripe is a privately-held company, so most of its financials are not disclosed, but it was likely hit hard in 2022, when it laid off more than 1,000 staffers. At the time, CEO Patrick Collison blamed the economy and fears of a recession in a public letter – an explanation that won praise for its frankness. Stripe also cut its valuation multiple times over the years, though it recently jumped back up to around $70 billion in November, according to Bloomberg. The valuation puts Stripe in the same ranks as wealthy startups like SpaceX and OpenAI, though it’s still below its 2021 peak of $95 billion. Stripe is the second-largest startup in the Bay Area, behind only OpenAI, according to SFGate. Advertisement

Title: Novo Nordisk stock surges 12% as an Ozempic alternative shows promising weight loss
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-amycretin-trial-weight-loss-drugs-1851746953
Time Published: 2025-01-24T14:00:00Z

Novo Nordisk (NVO-3.15%) stock jumped 12% in pre-market trading Friday after it released promising results of an early-stage weight loss drug trial. The Danish pharmaceutical giant announced Friday that a small clinical trial found that 20 milligram once-weekly injections of its amycretin obesity drug helped obese and overweight patients lose 22% of their body weight in 36 weeks. “We are very encouraged by the subcutaneous phase 1b/2a results for amycretin in people living with overweight or obesity,” said Martin Lange, executive vice president for development at Novo. “The results seen in the trial support the weight lowering potential of this novel unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist, amycretin, that we have previously seen with the oral formulation.” Amycretin is what’s known as a “unimolecular long-acting GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist.” Essentially, it’s a combination of two hormones that regulate appetite and blood sugar levels. Popular GLP-1 agonists include Novo Nordisk’s own Wegovy and Ozempic, and Eli Lilly’s (LLY-0.14%) Zepbound and Mounjaro. Based on the latest results, Novo Nordisk said it’s now planning further clinical development of amycretin for obese and overweight adults. Findings from a small phase 1 clinical trial of oral amycretin last September suggested that the pill could lead to more and faster weight loss than popular weekly injection Wegovy. Novo Nordisk said that patients that took a once-daily 50mg dose of amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months, according to an abstract of the study. Trial participants that took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. For comparison, a larger clinical trial of Novo Nordisk’s popular weight-loss drug Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. It’s worth noting, however, that larger phase II, III, and IV trials, involving thousands more participants, could return different results. — Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

Title: After XRP Made New ATH at $3.4, Traders are Expecting Solana to Hit New Highs While DTX Leads Growth

For the first time in seven years, Ripple (XRP) made an impressive rally to a new high price of $3.4. This surge has reignited bullish sentiment in the crypto community. Now, savvy investors believe more gains could occur as rumors of a broader crypto adoption are underway. Also, Solana (SOL) has positioned itself as a top blockchain, showcasing steady growth over the past year. As more developments await this platform, traders expect that Solana will also hit new highs. Additionally, this new player, DTX Exchange (DTX), is gaining traction with its hybrid platform, as it aims to deliver unparalleled speed, security, and liquidity for traders. It leads many to speculate if DTX’s launch in Q1 2025 could position it ahead of Solana and XRP. The stage is indeed set for a thrilling showdown. This article shares more details about these assets. Ripple (XRP) Surges to $3.40 The XRP price’s rally to a recent high of $3.40 is fueled by a mix of exciting developments and bullish fundamentals. A game-changing report revealed Donald Trump’s openness to an America-first crypto reserve, spotlighting US-founded tokens like XRP, Solana, and USDC. This potential initiative has sparked investor optimism, setting the stage for increased adoption of these assets. Behind the scenes, crypto whales have been accumulating XRP, purchasing a staggering 1.43 billion tokens over two months — a move often signaling price discovery. This momentum has been bolstered by a 10% surge in trading volume, with $11 billion traded in just 24 hours. Adding fuel to the fire, the SEC’s appeal against Ripple unexpectedly boosted confidence, as the Commission didn’t dispute the court’s ruling that XRP isn’t a security. With bullish forecasts pointing to a breakout between $8 and $13, XRP’s rally may just be getting started. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis: Eyes on $300 as ETFs Spark Bullish Momentum Solana is making waves with a 20% intraday surge, currently trading above $230, despite a 30% dip earlier in January. Dominating the decentralized exchange (DEX) space with a 30% market share and $220+ billion in Q4 2024 trade volume, Solana remains a blockchain powerhouse. The buzz around SOL ETFs is also driving optimism, as top financial firms like Grayscale, VanEck, and Bitwise have filed applications with the SEC. With rulings expected between January 23 and 25, 2025, experts predict these ETFs could attract $3–6 billion in net assets within their first year. Technically, bullish patterns like strong support levels at $200 and $220 signal potential upside. While trading below the 50-day moving average, SOL shows bullish dominance, with green candles reinforcing upward momentum. DTX Exchange (DTX): Revolutionizing the Trading Landscape DTX Exchange is a groundbreaking platform designed to reshape both traditional and crypto trading by creating a seamless, inclusive environment for investors worldwide. At its core, DTX Exchange merges the best of centralized and decentralized models into the world’s first hybrid exchange.

The token’s presale success has been outstanding so far, with over $12 million raised. Interestingly, early investors have reaped 600% returns already. As the token price surges from $0.14 to its $0.20 launch price, new investors can still capitalize on a 40% gain before the presale ends. Analysts predict DTX could dominate 2025, riding the next bull run to unmatched heights. DTX Exchange (DTX) Could Lead the Charge in Q1 2025 As Ripple and Solana approach newer highs, DTX Exchange gains traction with its groundbreaking hybrid trading platform set to revolutionize the market in Q1 2025.

Title: Trump has a message to CEOs: Build in America or pay up
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-message-ceos-davos-america-business-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-24T13:45:20Z

President Donald Trump is making sure the whole world knows it: "America is back and open for business." Trump appeared via videolink to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, where he addressed some of the world's most powerful leaders. BI's Spriha Srivastava was in the room to witness the audience go from laughter to silence in seconds. "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America," Trump said. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff," he added. Trump has previously threatened to impose a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which he said could begin as early as February 1. He also proposed a 60% tariff on China during his presidential campaign, but he said earlier this week he was considering a 10% tariff on goods from the country next month. When Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman asked about Europe, Trump didn't hold back, voicing his frustration with European regulatory enforcement actions against tech giants like Apple, Google, and Meta (who were major donors to his inauguration and whose CEOs were prominent guests). "Whether you like them or not, they're American companies, and they shouldn't be doing that," Trump said. Trump has plans for the corporate tax rate. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's CEO, asked how the Trump administration would prioritize GDP growth and reducing inflation amid his dozens of executive orders. Trump said he would work to bring the corporate tax rate down to 15% from 21%, provided companies manufacture their products in the US. The president also called out big banks, accusing them of discriminating against conservatives. "Many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America," he said. Bank of America responded publicly, saying it welcomes conservatives among its 70 million clients. The president also thanked Saudi Arabia after it announced it would invest $600 billion in the US, but Trump added that he would be asking the crown prince "who's a fantastic guy, to round it out to around $1 trillion." When Trump finished, Schwarzman remarked: "I'm sure the crown prince of Saudi Arabia will be really glad you gave this speech today." Trump's speech reminded Spriha of how different his style is from the measured, diplomatic tone that usually defines Davos. Whether his message landed the way he intended, however, is another question. BI's Katie Balevic, Dominick Reuter, Noah Sheidlower, and Allie Kelly have the full rundown of Trump's address.

Title: Signal: Surging Netflix Stock Could Hit Four Digits, And Soon
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/24/signal-surging-netflix-stock-could-hit-four-digits-and-soon/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T13:00:00Z

Netflix (NFLX) was a big winner on Wall Street this week. The streaming stock gapped 9.7% higher on Jan. 22, in the wake of an outstanding earnings report that saw the company post a top-line beat for the fourth quarter and topple 300 million subscribers. The shares hit a record high of $999 that day, before cooling off and settling at $953.99. The good news for investors betting on NFLX hitting four digits – the stock is flashing a historically bullish signal on the charts. Netflix’s recent high coincides with historically low implied volatility (IV) – a combination that has generated tailwinds in the past. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been eight times over the last five years when the equity was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) also happened to sit in the 20th annual percentile or lower. This is the case with the stock’s current SVI of 25%, which sits in the 6th percentile of its annual range. Netflix stock chart with 80-day moving average Data shows that one month after those signals, the equity boasted a 75% win rate and averaged a 4.7% return over that timeframe. From its current perch of $979.92, a similar move would put NFLX comfortably above $1,000 in the next month. There are additional technical support levels to watch that could make this rally sustainable. Note in the chart above the channel of higher highs carved since August. If the stock can topple the upper rail of this channel, NFLX could be off to the races. The equity could also see chart support step up at its newly-cleared +10% year-to-date level, while its 80-day moving average was an effective springboard earlier this month, also per the chart above. Analysts have been slow to adjust, and bull notes could also keep the wind at the security’s back. There are still 16 brokerages of the 41 in coverage that are on the sidelines with “hold” or “strong sell” ratings, while NFLX’s consensus 12-month price target of $1,047.20 is only a 6.6% premium from its current perch.

Title: Want a Job In AI & Healthcare Tech? Here Are 5 Growth Areas Actively Hiring Right Now
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/saibala/2025/01/24/want-a-job-in-ai--healthcare-tech-here-are-5-growth-areas-actively-hiring-right-now/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T13:00:00Z

There is significant demand for individuals interested in artificial intelligence and digital ... [+] transformation. There are widely mixed opinions on the state of the current job market. Most industry leaders signal that economic conditions seem to be healthy and the state of the market is incredibly robust. In fact, the latest report indicates that the U.S. economy added nearly 256,000 positions in December. However, many individuals are equally frustrated with the lack of opportunities and are experiencing a relatively stagnant labor market, especially with the numerous layoffs that have occurred in the last year. Some sectors have been more proactive than others, especially with regards to investing heavily in the new wave of AI innovation and digital transformation, which has resulted in increased demand for talent and skilled workers. Healthcare is one such field and has especially embraced AI as a means to reduce administrative burdens and improve workflows in the field. Indeed, 2025 will be a monumental year for this work. Individuals that are interested in healthcare technology and AI may have opportunities in the following 5 growth areas that are actively ramping up spending and hiring: 1. Work surrounding AI agents: 2025 is purported to be the year of AI agents in healthcare, which may be used for a variety of roles including responding to customer service inquiries, assisting with routine paperwork or even streamlining common and protocolized tasks. In fact, founder and CEO of Nvidia Jensen Huang mentioned at the CES conference earlier this month that IT departments will soon “become the HR of AI agents,” given how widespread and prevalent they will become. 2. Cloud engineering and architecture: many of the largest AI platforms including those by Google, Amazon and Microsoft are hosted and provided through their respective cloud services. For example, Google’s Vertex AI Search is a widely successful product which streamlines search within healthcare organizations and enables rapid insight generation for providers. Healthcare organizations can access this platform through Google Cloud. AWS and Microsoft Azure offer similar services. Thus, cloud applications have become incredibly critical in the AI arena and will undoubtedly require a lot of talent. 3. Digital twins technology: this is another growing area which enables organizations to create virtual models to run simulations and alter paradigms to better inform decision-making. Digital twin platforms can entail technical models such as a human heart model or a protein molecule to aid in drug development, or larger datasets across an entire population or community to inform macroscopic decisions. Digital twins have immense potential in healthcare as the technology can be used to resolve critical situations with high fidelity representations. Dr. Natalia Trayanova leads some of this work at Johns Hopkins University and uses the technology to support personalized healthcare in the field of cardiology: “digital twinning technology promises to deliver a digital representation of organs or even patients by using tools capable of simulating personal health conditions and predicting patient or disease trajectories on the basis of relationships learned both from data and from biophysics knowledge. Such virtual replicas would update themselves with data from monitoring devices and medical tests and assessments, reflecting dynamically the changes in our health conditions and the responses to treatment.” 4. Health devices: this area is projected to have a blockbuster decade as there has been an increased focus by the general population on collecting more health metrics and insights. For example, Google’s FitBit is one of the most popular devices in the world of personalized hardware and provides users with information on their daily energy expenditure and fitness goals. Another great example is the Oura ring, which has been incredibly popular in the last few years as a sleep tracking device; the company just recently hit $5 billion in valuation. There is a huge demand for both software experts and hardware engineers in this line of work. 5. Technology strategy: these roles will be a key aspect of healthcare organization portfolios in the coming years. Despite all the technical work, organizations must ultimately devise a strategy and justify their investments in artificial intelligence and digital health. This is where senior strategists and those familiar with enterprise optimization can come in handy, especially as many organizations are struggling to still define and realize the true ROI for healthcare AI applications. These leaders will be paramount to understand the technology landscape, develop accurate forecasts and determine the future course for organizations. Undoubtedly, those interested in technology will have to remain nimble and willing to up-skill themselves accordingly. Despite a rapidly changing job landscape, the swift growth of technology and AI, especially as they pertain to healthcare, offer numerous potential opportunities for determined job seekers to take advantage of.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 24 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing.

Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 24 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software.

Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

The trial investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and proof-of-concept after once-weekly subcutaneous administrations of amycretin in 125 people with overweight or obesity. The trial was a combined single ascending dose, multiple ascending dose and dose-response trial investigating three different maintenance doses with a total treatment duration of up to 36 weeks. The primary endpoint was treatment emergent adverse events. The safety profile of amycretin was consistent with incretin-based therapies. The most common adverse events with amycretin were gastrointestinal and the vast majority were mild to moderate in severity. When evaluating the effects of treatment if all people adhered to treatment1 from a mean baseline body weight of 92.7 kg, people treated with amycretin achieved an estimated body weight loss of 9.7% on 1.25mg (20 weeks), 16.2% on 5mg (28 weeks) and 22.0% on 20mg (36 weeks). People treated with placebo experienced an estimated 1.9%, 2.3% and 2.0% body weight gain, respectively. “We are very encouraged by the subcutaneous phase 1b/2a results for amycretin in people living with overweight or obesity,” said Martin Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “The results seen in the trial support the weight lowering potential of this novel unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist, amycretin, that we have previously seen with the oral formulation.” Based on the results, Novo Nordisk is now planning further clinical development of amycretin in adults with overweight or obesity.

Title: Netflix Africa Hires Scripted Content Chief As Tendeka Matatu Exits

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: Netflix‘s Africa content team has reshuffled with ex-Amazon exec Kaye-Ann Williams brought in to oversee TV and movies as Tendeka Matatu exits. Williams takes on the newly-created Director of Scripted Content role and will focus on local productions, overseeing a team that develops and creates African original films and series. She joins after a short stint as content boss at The Traitors South Africa producer Primedia Studios and is a former Head of Scripted Series and Movies at Prime Video/Amazon Studios, where she focused on South Africa. Commencing her role next month, Williams will report to Ben Amadasun, Netflix’s Vice President of Middle East & Africa Content. Watch on Deadline Related Stories News 'Fallout', 'Nobody Wants This', 'American Nightmare' Are Top New Originals In Nielsen 2024 Streaming Rankings; 'Bluey', 'Bridgerton', 'Moana' Most-Watched Overall News Jeremy Allen White To Star & EP Netflix Bisexual Romance Drama 'Enigma Variations' Williams will join shortly after the exit of Matatu, who was Director of Local Language Films, Africa, for the past three years. No word on Matatu’s next move but we are told he is pursuing other opportunities. His credits included Heart of the Hunter and Kandasamys: The Baby. Amadasun credited Williams with helping creative talent “create some of the most ambitious projects on African television.” “I’m delighted to welcome Kaye-Ann to the team as we strengthen our long-term commitment to African storytelling,” he added. “I look forward to working alongside her to further build on the wonderful work the team has done so far to deliver compelling stories from Africa and to nurture our many local creative partnerships.” Amazon cut funding in Africa and made layoffs last year and sources from the local sector had recently questioned whether Netflix was heading in the same direction, with rumors of shows being pulled. Netflix pushed back, noting that it is “strengthening its investment in African storytelling” and pointing to Williams’ stellar credentials. Since kickstarting local African commissioning with 2020’s Queen Sono, Netflix cited significant deals struck with the likes of Silverton Siege’s Mandla Dube and Jayan Moodley, creator of the Kandasamys franchise. At the recent MIP Africa in Cape Town, Amadasun unveiled a trio of new movies along with a Blood Legacy series from Blood & Water producer Gambit Films and reality show Love Never Lies: South Africa. The news comes off the back of a strong week for Netflix. The streaming powerhouse smashed estimates by adding nearly 19 million subscribers in Q4 – the final quarter for which it will report these numbers.

On a pleasant January morning in Bengaluru, known globally as the Silicon Valley of India, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti opened a new consulate, the fifth in the South Asian nation. In three days, the Joe Biden appointee would step down, paving the way for the Trump 2.0 administration to choose his replacement. Speaking at the event, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar called it a “new milestone” in bilateral relations, particularly in sectors like technology, space, defense, and education. “As we enter an era of AI, EVs, drones, biotechnology, and advanced space exploration, our partnership will increasingly be defined by innovation. Bengaluru, as India’s tech capital, and [the state of] Karnataka, as a hub of innovation, will play crucial roles in this journey,” Jaishankar said. Three days later, on January 20, he would be attending the swearing-in ceremony of US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC. Later, he would engage the newly appointed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the issue of “irregular immigration” and visa policy regarding the millions of Indian professionals in the US. On that January day, around 8,000 miles away, in a Boston suburb, N. Ranganathan, a 36-year-old software techie working as a software analyst, was visibly upset with a leading aircraft manufacturer. He, his wife and their three-year-old son were in for a hard realization about the US being “a land of dreams.” “I have been in this country for the last seven years and with my son having been born here, I was hoping that my son gets naturalized citizenship. With the latest ruling by the president, I am not sure whether I and my family want to be [here], as we feel disrespected about the fact that despite paying taxes as well as contributing to the US economy, we are treated like ‘boat people’ (refugees).” Like Ranganathan, millions of Indians face the dilemma of whether to continue working in the US or seek alternative options. US President Donald Trump began his term in office with sweeping executive orders, including one ending birthright citizenship for children whose parents are neither American citizens nor permanent residents. This could affect over a million Indians waiting for green cards – with some of them locked in a bureaucratic backlog for a decade. However, broader concern over Trump’s visa policies during his second term is something that is being discussed both among the diaspora in the US and back in Bengaluru and other Indian tech hubs. India’s $250 billion IT outsourcing industry is at a critical juncture – and the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not the biggest challenge. In December, social media was boiling after billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy defended the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. Their statements sparked an online spat between anti-immigration Trump loyalists and the tech-oriented conservative faction. The US tech industry, which is facing layoffs, relies on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of IT professionals – mainly from India (over 72%), as well as China and other nations. Supporters claim that H-1B workers address essential skill shortages and foster innovation, while opponents argue that the program keeps wages low and displaces US employees. Musk, who himself is a South African immigrant who once held an H-1B visa, said he was in favor of bringing “the top ~0.1% of engineering talent” via a legal route as it is “essential for America to keep winning.” He also told critics to “go f*** yourself in the face,” referring to them as “subtards.” Musk has long argued for increased immigration and greater opportunities for skilled workers to live and work in the US, often pointing out that the country’s long-term success depends on attracting the best and brightest talent globally. The online standoff came days after the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rule aimed at ‘reforming’ the H-1B program to help American companies address critical workforce shortages. The new rule looks to simplify the approval process, enhancing flexibility for employers to retain skilled workers, and strengthen the program’s oversight and integrity. Additionally, on December 27th, the US Department of State announced the completion of a successful pilot program to let people renew H-1B visas without having to leave the country. This pilot program streamlined the renewal process for thousands of applicants, the Department of State said, promising to establish a US-based renewal program in 2025. At around the same time, President Trump announced the appointment of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian-born venture capitalist, to lead artificial intelligence policy. In the past, Krishnan had supported the removal of country caps on green cards for skilled immigrants in the US. This was too much for some MAGA supporters, who feel that this visa system needs to be scrapped as it doesn’t add any value to the US economy and instead takes away the jobs of people who have similar qualifications. In some cases, American workers who were laid off were forced to train their H-1B counterparts. If they failed to do so, they risked losing their severance pay. Federal lawsuits were filed by two of the tech workers laid off from the Walt Disney Co. One of them even testified before a Senate Committee. The war of words on H-1B was not limited to social media. There have been racist attacks against Indians on the TV and in real life. Fox News carried an interview with a commentator who openly referred to Indians as “third world parasites.” Immediately after the online fracas between Musk and other MAGA supporters, Trump came to Elon’s defense. In an interview with the New York Post, he praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the US. “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,” Trump said. Speaking at a press conference at the White House after taking office, Trump said “I like both sides of the argument, but I also like very competent people coming into our country, even if that involves them training and helping other people that may not have the qualifications they do,” he said while addressing a joint press conference at the White House with Oracle CTO Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, and Open AI CEO Sam Altman. “We have to have quality people coming in. Now by doing that, we’re expanding businesses and that takes care of everybody. So I’m sort of on both sides of the argument, but what I really do feel is that we have to let really competent people, great people, come into our country. And we do that through the H-1B program,” he added. This marked a U-turn on H-1B visas for Trump; in 2016 he called them "very, very bad” for American workers. Months before the end of his first term as president in 2020, he imposed a temporary ban on the visas, which was later struck down by a federal court. The question for those whose lives and profits revolve around H-1B visas remains open – how will Trump manage the division between his MAGA base and Big Tech? The H-1B visa program, which started in 1990, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in occupations that typically require a high level of technical expertise (fields such as IT, engineering, and healthcare). The visa is initially granted for three years, and can be extended by another three years. Every year, 85,000 such visas are up for grabs, through a lottery system. Major tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Qualcomm Technologies, Ernst and Young, as well as outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Consulting, HCL America and others heavily rely on H-1B visas. Indian companies, who swarmed the US in large numbers at the height of the dotcom boom-in the 1990s are the biggest beneficiaries of H-1B visas.In May 2024, according to US State Department data from 2022, as much as 77% of 320,000 H-1B visa applications went to Indians. Indian companies are taking measures to counter any negative pushback with regard to H-1B visas, by hiring locals. For India’s second-largest information technology company Infosys, over 60% of the workforce in the US now comprises locals, Infosys’ Chief Financial Officer Jayesh Sanghrajka told media recently. TCS CEO Krithivasan told Moneycontrol that a decrease in H-1B visas can be offset by other strategies, such as relocating work to India, reducing the overall reliance on H-1B. From the first time Trump took charge in 2016, the US authorities have clamped down on frauds related to applications from H-1B, increased the cost of filings [upwards of $8,000] and even limited repeated filings, in an effort to make the system fair. As a result, people can no longer submit multiple applications to increase their chances of winning the lottery, as this creates an unfair advantage. The crackdown on frauds seemed to have worked to some extent. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services [USCIS] revealed that the number of entries for the year’s lottery stood at 470,342, marking a substantial 38% decline from the 758,994 entries received in 2023, according to a report by the Associated Press. Since December, both Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with cutting government spending in his new administration, seem to have offered their position on H-1B visas. Following the backlash, the tech barons have said that the program needs a fix. “Easily fixed by raising the minimum salary significantly and adding a yearly cost for maintaining the H-1B, making it materially more expensive to hire from overseas than domestically. I’ve been very clear that the program is broken and needs major reform,” Musk said days after telling critics to “go f*** yourself.” Immigrant attorneys believe that unlike the past, this time things may actually change. “The system is broken and it needs to be fixed, especially around the area of what is considered to be a job/service that cannot be done by a local and requires a special visa,” an attorney from a Washington-based law firm told RT. Meanwhile, India has used diplomatic language to advocate for favorable visa policies while emphasizing mutual benefits and India’s indispensable role in the partnership. “India-US economic ties benefit a lot from the technical expertise provided by skilled professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in early January, breaking his silence on the H-1B debate. Industry watchers believe that H-1B visas can still address the basic issues which led to its creation in the first place, i.e. supplying engineers to met tech’s gargantuan demands. “The H-1B program, which is based on numerical limits set over 30 years ago, still remains terribly short of meeting the needs of the US economy in the global competition for talent, particularly in STEM fields,” believes Ashank Desai, Principal Founder and former Chairman of Mastek as well as founding member of Indian software lobby firm NASSCOM. Ganesh Natarajan, Executive Chairman and Founder of 5F World, and formerly CEO of Zensar, a Pune-based outsourcing firm, told RT the H-1B mindset needs to change “from wage arbitrage to quality of talent. In many ways, it needs to evolve.” Ultimately, the next move of the Trump administration will significantly impact India’s exports. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, India’s total exports reached $776.68 billion in fiscal year 2023-24. Software exports alone account for about 4% of the country’s GDP and generate approximately 5.4 million direct jobs and nearly 20 million indirect jobs. Therefore, any changes to visa policies are likely to affect India’s export landscape.

Title: There’s Still Money to Be Made at Sundance — Or So Producers Hope

Time Published: 2025-01-23T22:58:20Z

Kicking off its 11-day run Thursday and showcasing 88 feature films painstakingly selected from a record-high 16,000 submissions this year, the Sundance Film Festival remains a sui generis staging ground for the kind of buzzy, splashy titles that tend to explode out of Park City and ripple across popular culture. The mordant, Rose Byrne-starring dramedy If I Had Legs I’d Kick You, with its Conan O’Brien cameo? Director Bill Condon’s remake of the novel adaptation-turned-Broadway musical-turned-Oscar-winning 1985-drama Kiss of the Spider Woman, co-starring Jennifer Lopez? Director David France’s documentary Free Leonard Peltier which premieres just days after President Biden actually freed the well-known Indigenous activist (who was convicted of killing two FBI agents and spent the last five decades behind bars)? Any or all of them could become inescapable water-cooler conversation over the next twelve months if Sundance’s past remains its prologue. But business as usual at Sundance is hardly guaranteed this year, with catastrophic L.A. wildfires still burning, an impending move from the festival’s longtime base in Utah’s Wasatch mountains, and a recent shitstorm of corporate layoffs, depressed media stock prices, and metastasizing unemployment in film projects. In the afterglow of CODA, which won Sundance’s Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award before going on to win Best Picture at the 2022 Academy Awards, Hollywood still looks to Park City as a blast-off pad for future Oscar bait. Toward that end, Jesse Eisenberg’s awards season contender A Real Pain (nominated for a Best Original Screenplay Oscar Thursday morning) and art-house dark horse A Different Man (Best Makeup and Hairstyling), in addition to the Best Feature Documentary nominees Sugarcane, Black Box Diaries, Porcelain War and Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat all got their start at Sundance ‘24. But more generally, Sundance can be understood to provide a kind of bellwether for the health of independent film as both a cinematic genre and business model. “It just gives you this snapshot, almost like a crystal ball,” says Eugene Hernandez, the fest’s director and head of public programming. “You get this moment to peer into the future. These are the films that will be coming later in the year. It is a great moment to take stock of what the year in film has told us, and what do we see coming around the bend?” Despite the industry being significantly diminished by twin Hollywood strikes and pandemic hangover, a cross-section of independent producers hoping to sell films at Sundance tell Vulture they are, nonetheless, bullish on indie filmdom. While the boom times — when platforms like Amazon showed up at the festival with a veritable Brinks truck full of cash to splash out on an entire slate of films — may be firmly in the past, industry machers say there is a wider variety of outlets acquiring independent movies for distribution, both streaming and theatrically, than at any time in recent memory. “If you make a good movie nowadays for a moderate price, I believe there are 10 places that can competitively buy that film,” says Josh Peters, a former director of acquisitions at Focus Features who is a producer on this year’s “coming-of-age drama where the person doesn’t get to come of age” Ricky. “Buyers are being more pragmatic. And I’m noticing a group of financiers who are willing, in the aggregate, to put in a couple hundred thousand here, a couple hundred thousand there. So there’s an ecosystem of buyers telling artists, Take risks. Challenge yourself. Do what’s important to you.” At the Toronto International Film Festival in September, producers Duncan Montgomery and Alex Orlovsky premiered and sold distribution rights for The Last Showgirl to Roadside Attractions, then launched a quick-turnaround theatrical release and awards-qualifying run in December. Now in Park City with the Premieres section thriller Lurker (about a young man who becomes obsessed with an up-and-coming pop star played by Saltburn’s Archie Madekwe), Montgomery contrasts Sundance’s sunny sense of optimism with the kind of mad dash into awards season that a TIFF acquisition deal most often entails. “It feels like there’s a bit of a wind in the sails of indie films,” Montgomery says. “I’m not going to say I know what buyers think. But I’m hopeful that there’s a positive vibe going in. And there’s something about the new year: [Sundance’s] placement in the third week in January. There’s promise. There’s hope. As opposed to those fall festivals where there’s lots of stress.” Several producers point out that disruptions surrounding the 2023 strikes — production shutdowns, release delays, overall starvation of filmic product at the cineplex — contributed to an uptick in the amount of indie fare reaching screens last year. That comes into clearest focus with the awards-y titles that have remained in the cultural conversation through today’s Oscars nominations announcement. Among them: Demi Moore’s body-horror comeback vehicle The Substance, director Gia Coppola’s The Last Showgirl, the controversial Trump biopic The Apprentice, A Different Man (for which star Sebastian Stan won a Golden Globe this month) and the prison-thespian bio-drama Sing Sing. All generated strong buzz at festivals including Toronto, Cannes and Sundance en route to their respective public offerings. That’s part of the calculus behind producers David Siegel and Scott McGehee repeatedly taking their films to the festival since 1994 and aiming to land placement this year for their Gulf War-adjacent crisis-actor comedy Atropia, whose ensemble cast includes Alia Shawcat, Callum Turner, Chloe Sevigny and Channing Tatum. Over that time, the producers have observed Sundance’s imprimatur assuming increasing importance in both marketing and public recognition. “It seems like the audience has really evolved,” McGehee says. “And they are really paying attention to box office now, to film festivals, to reviews. The way audiences engage with the business of the film industry is very different. So these days it seems like audiences care about the lineage that a film has in getting to them. And distributors care about having those things to present to an audience.” While the fest’s renown as North America’s preeminent showcase for indie cinema remains beyond dispute, its pedestal for documentary titles has been complicated by the non-fiction film genre’s declining bankability. Since the N95 era, theatrical turnout for doc features has plummeted in almost inverse proportion to their increasing streaming popularity. But this year, of course, four out of five nominees for the Best Documentary Feature Oscar came from Sundance. And to hear it from Topic Studios’ head of film and documentaries Ryan Heller — who heads to Sundance with the documentaries It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley and the Norwegian “high school movie set at the edge of the earth” Folktales — finding a sweet spot between distributor and material is still achievable. “We’re in a moment where the buyers continue to be very specific and savvy about what works for them,” Heller says. “We’re not in a moment where a buyer is coming in saying, I need five movies. It’s more, If we see something we love, we’ll buy it. But looking at last year’s Sundance, there’s a real case to be made that the right buyer for the right movie is still a perfect match.” Longtime industry pass holder Kevin Iwashina hits Park City this week with the Glenn Kaino-directed short film he produced, Hoops, Hopes & Dreams — it unpacks an unconventional political strategy by Martin Luther King Jr. and an all-star team of ’60s civil rights activists who used pick-up basketball to rally young voters and build networks of empowerment for disenfranchised communities. When I question Iwashina about the health of indie film as a genre, he quickly corrects me: “Indie film is a financial model; it’s not a genre.” From there, the producer takes a brickbat to distinctions between mainstream and independent movies he feels are increasingly irrelevant to Generation Z. “We’re now in a period where there is a range of cinema, a range of quality. Sometimes that quality is going to come in the form of something made outside the system like Anora. And sometimes it’s going to come from within, like The Wild Robot,” Iwashina continues. “A24, as far as any young person is concerned, isn’t indie movies. Those are movies. I think categorically, we just have to redefine and not ghettoize this concept of indie.” “Let’s stop playing identity politics with movies,” he adds. “We know what happened when we did that in the election.”

Title: The Perils of Abusing Leverage

By Adam Sharp Posted January 23, 2025 In 2004, I imploded my first trading account. I was 24 years old and thought I was hot stuff. You see, I had just gotten my stockbroker and financial advisor licenses. I was young, naive, and ready to take on the world. My journey began trading hot stocks like Research in Motion (RIMM). On my second trade, I made $1,400. Wow, this is easy! That win was the worst thing that could have happened. I ramped it up and started using absurd amounts of leverage. Every trade was at least 30% of the account, and occasionally more than 100%. Swing trading, daytrading, momentum, I tried it all. And eventually my trading account balance ticked down to zero. That was my first and only account wipeout. It was a painful – but important – lesson. Fortunately I was young and didn’t have much to lose. I haven’t used margin since. I learned from the experience, and began holding the vast majority of my portfolio in long-term positions. Eventually I learned to use options properly, and those are now the only way I employ leverage. When buying options, potential losses are limited to your initial investment. And the possible upside is just as lucrative as margin. For most of us, however, options should make up a limited portion of our portfolios. Yes, the profit potential is high, but so can be the losses. Keep things balanced. I recently found a painful margin story on Reddit’s infamous WallStreetBets forum. Back in 2018, a user going by the handle “DubiouslyCurious” correctly predicted the rise of NVIDIA (NVDA). He saw that the company was moving beyond video game hardware and into the nascent AI space. So DubiouslyCurious went all-in on NVIDIA with his net worth of approximately £100,000 (British pounds). He used margin to leverage his position up 3x. For a while, everything was going according to plan. NVIDIA shares rose, and his position was in profit. DubiouslyCurious wrote that, “For the first time in my life, I saw a path to financial security.” And then 2020 happened. The COVID pandemic was a classic black swan event, and the crash wiped out his position. The chart below, posted by DubiouslyCurious himself, tells the story. The red line is his leveraged position, and the blue line shows how his investment would have performed without 3x leverage. Source: Yahoo Finance The story was hard to read. I felt that pain. He had correctly assessed NVIDIA’s prospects, but due to his aggressive use of leverage (combined with Dr. Fauci’s aggressive use of gain-of-function research on coronaviruses), he lost it all. “I sold when I had to take out the pittance remaining just to buy food. Ironically, of course, as soon as I sell it jumped back up. But by that point the damage had been done.” If he had simply bought NVIDIA shares without leverage, his position today would be worth over £2 million. Leverage is not something to be played with or taken lightly. With 3x margin, it only takes a 33% correction to wipe out a position. On top of that, you’re paying interest to borrow the funds. Many investors have a story like mine or DubiouslyCurious’. It’s practically an initiation ritual for traders. Most of us take a major loss at some point in our experience. The important thing is that we learn from our mistakes, and incorporate real change into our investing strategies going forward. The earlier an investor learns this lesson, the better. So in the near future I’m going to let my kids trade with $100 each. If the plan works, they’ll lose most of it. And by learning this lesson so early in life, they’ll be ahead of the game once they begin their real investing journey. Then I’ll teach them about the virtues of a long-term, balanced approach.

Title: Texas Asks Wall Street Firms for Details About DEI Efforts

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Texas and nine other Republican-led states are ratcheting up pressure on Wall Street’s diversity programs, asking firms about their policies on hiring and supplier selections as the Trump administration moves to gut DEI. Most Read from Bloomberg What Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Vienna Embraces Heat Pumps to Ditch Russian Gas How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on Thursday to the firms saying they appear to “unlawfully advance discriminatory” diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and demanded they respond to a series of questions about their programs. He said the companies may have breached their fiduciary duties by pursuing an “ulterior political motive or agenda.” The letter was sent to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and money manager BlackRock Inc. “You appear to have embraced race- and sex-based quotas and to have made business and investment decisions based not on maximizing shareholder and asset value, but in the furtherance of political agendas,” Paxton said in a letter obtained by Bloomberg. Paxton gave the firms 45 days to respond to the questions. “Before pursuing legal action, we are extending to each of you an opportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,” he wrote. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment, while BlackRock and the other banks haven’t provided a response. The letter comes after Trump, in his second day in office, ordered federal contractors to affirm they don’t “engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.” He directed government agencies to draw up a list of publicly traded companies for potential investigations into compliance violations. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs’ chief executive officers said on Wednesday that they will continue to focus on efforts to promote DEI in their workforces and customer bases. “We’re going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,” JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon said. The attorneys general cited pledges and goals made and set by finance firms since 2021 to bolster hiring of women and minorities. For example, JPMorgan pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024 and Goldman set a goal of spending more than $1 billion on diverse vendors. Corporate America ramped up its diversity efforts in the wake of the MeToo movement and the 2020 death of George Floyd that sparked nationwide unrest. In November, Paxton led a move to sue BlackRock, Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by using climate investing strategies to suppress coal production. BlackRock said the suggestion that it invested money in companies with the goal of harming them “is baseless and defies common sense.” In Thursday’s letter, Paxton also asked firms about their net zero emissions commitments and use of shareholder votes and conversations with companies to shift away from fossil fuels. For instance, the attorneys general asked BlackRock for details about communications it had with Climate Action 100+, an environmental group, and reasons for backing shareholder proposals focused on climate change. They also asked banks for information related to the steps they have taken to meet net zero goals. Financial firms, including the six cited by Paxton, have quit climate groups since early last month. The attorneys general that joined Paxton in sending the letter to the banks and BlackRock include those from Utah, Iowa, Indiana and Alabama. --With assistance from Georgia Hall.

While Amazon and Walmart may be fierce competitors in the retail world, their commitment to helping those in need during times of crisis proves even corporate rivals can unite in the face of disaster. Both companies have pledged significant financial support to assist victims of the recent wildfires ravaging the Los Angeles area, offering critical resources to affected communities, first responders and local organizations. Their collective efforts highlight the power of corporate philanthropy when disaster strikes. Amazon committed $10 million to support relief efforts for communities in the Los Angeles area affected by recent wildfires, many of those communities home to Amazon employees and their families. The donation will go to local and national disaster response organizations, including the American Red Cross, FireAid, MusiCares Fire Relief and World Central Kitchen. Additionally, Amazon donated more than 415,000 essential items to 29 organizations, including fire stations and community groups, and continues to send supplies such as food, water, shelter items and medical equipment. The company is leveraging its AWS cloud technology, including drone support, to assist emergency responders. Meanwhile, Walmart donated $2.5 million to help Los Angeles fire victims. This includes donations of food, water, essential products and grants. The official statement from Walmart reads: “Associates, customers, and members in the communities we serve are experiencing the devastating impacts of the wildfires in Southern California. Our thoughts are with those affected, and we are acting quickly to help. Walmart, Sam’s Club, and the Walmart Foundation are committing $2.5 million to support relief efforts, including donations of food, water, essential products and grants. Over the past several days, Walmart stores in Southern California have donated food, water, and gift cards to help first responders and shelters support people in need. We’re also working with nonprofits and suppliers to bring resources into communities. Throughout the response, we’ll continue looking for ways to support our associates, customers, members, and their families.” Here’s a look at other notable developments from Amazon and Walmart in the past week: We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

The company sees its adjusted operating margin widening to between 21% and 22% in 2027 as part of a three-year framework for guidance. That's higher than Visible Alpha's 19.68% consensus. Twilio's adjusted operating margin in the most recent quarter was 16.1%. Twilio revealed its new guidance at a Thursday investor event. There, the company's executives also committed to generating $3 billion in free cash flow over the next three years, compared with approximately $692 million in free cash flow for 2022, 2023 and 2024. The Visible Alpha consensus for Twilio's 2025 through 2027 was $2.76 billion. The company's stock price rose more than 10% in extended trading after the company released its presentation for the event. If 2024 was about rebuilding Twilio's foundation, 2025 is all about execution, CEO Khozema Shipchandler told CNBC ahead of the company's investor day. "If we execute well in 2025, I think we write our own story from 2026 on," said Shipchandler, who joined Twilio as finance chief after 22 years at GE in 2018 and replaced co-founder Jeff Lawson as CEO in January 2024. Twilio, which sends text messages and emails for customers, did not issue a revenue growth target for 2027 at its Thursday event. Management on Thursday also provided guidance for 2025. It called for $825 million to $850 million in free cash flow and the same amount in adjusted operating income, with 7% to 8% revenue growth year over year. The Visible Alpha consensus was $814 million in adjusted operating income and about $808 million in free cash flow. The 2025 revenue forecast was in line with LSEG consensus. Over 9,000 AI companies are already building on Twilio services. That includes OpenAI, which in December announced the 1-800-CHATGPT service that draws on Twilio voice tools. "We want to be able to take a bunch more of those, as well as large enterprises on," Shipchandler said. "We're kind of open season on both." After Twilio shares debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 2016, investors piled in as the company delivered consistently high revenue growth rates. The stock drifted lower in 2022 as investors became more interested in profitable companies, with interest rates ratcheting upward. At the same time, Twilio's revenue growth was slowing down. Shareholder input influenced a reorganization that included a 17% workforce reduction in early 2023, and activist investors Anson Funds and Legion Partners Asset Management agitated for a sale of Twilio or one of its business units, CNBC reported. Since activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management won a Twilio board seat last April, Twilio's stock has jumped about 81%, as revenue growth has accelerated and losses have narrowed. Twilio has an opportunity to show double-digit growth in 2025 and beyond, Mizuho analysts said in a note earlier this month. The analysts have the equivalent of buy rating on the stock. By expanding into new areas, such as conversational artificial intelligence, Twilio says it can sell into a $158 billion total addressable market by 2028, compared with $119 billion when only focusing on the communications and customer data platform categories. The company doesn't believe acquisitions will be necessary to reach its new total addressable market, a spokesperson said. Twilio's preliminary results for the fourth quarter show 11% revenue growth, with adjusted operating income that exceeds the top end of the $185 million to $195 million range that the company issued in October. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected 7.9% revenue growth, and according to Visible Alpha, the adjusted operating income consensus was about $190 million.

To that point, 46% of workers who currently work from home at least sometimes would be somewhat or very unlikely to stay at their job if their employer scrapped remote work, according to a recent poll by Pew Research Center. Yet, employers have reined in remote work. About 75% of workers were required to be in the office a certain number of days per week or month as of October 2024, up from 63% in February 2023, Pew found. "There's a certain creeping up" of return-to-office policies, said Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center. Companies like Amazon, AT&T, Boeing, Dell Technologies, JPMorgan Chase, UPS and The Washington Post have called at least some employees back to the office five days a week. President Donald Trump signed an executive action on Monday calling federal employees back to their desks "as soon as practicable." Similar to the Pew survey, a poll conducted by Bamboo HR found that 28% of workers would consider quitting due to a return-to-office mandate. The data "underscores how comfortable people have become with this arrangement, and how it really fits in with their lifestyle," Parker said. Workers consistently cite a better work-life balance as a "huge benefit" of remote work, Parker said. Indeed, they see the financial value of hybrid work as being equivalent to an 8% raise, according to research by Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies workplace management. Many economists think that the higher prevalence of remote work, relative to the pre-pandemic era, has become an entrenched feature of the U.S. labor market. "Remote work is not going away," Bloom previously told CNBC. That's largely because it boost profits for companies: Workers quit less often, meaning employers save money on recruiting and other functions tied to attrition, Bloom said. Meanwhile, data shows that productivity doesn't suffer in hybrid work arrangements, he said. More from Personal Finance:How to know if a rental listing is a scamNow is an 'ideal time' to reassess your retirement savingsHow climate change is reshaping home insurance costs More than 60% of paid, full workdays were done remotely in early 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic — up from less than 10% before the pandemic, according to WFH Research, a project run jointly by researchers from MIT, Stanford, the University of Chicago and Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. That share has fallen by more than half. However, it has leveled out between 25% and 30% for about two years, according to WFH Research data. About 31% of employers reduced remote work opportunities in 2024, down from 43% in 2023, according to a ZipRecruiter survey. Yet, another 33% expanded remote work, up from 32% the prior year. Companies that imposed RTO mandates have annual rates of employee turnover that are 13% higher than those that have become "more supportive" of remote work, ZipRecruiter said. "The ability to work from anywhere remains a top priority for many professionals," according to a 2024 poll by consulting firm Korn Ferry of 10,000 workers in the U.S., U.K., Brazil, Middle East, Australia and India. Some businesses force workers back to the office precisely because they want workers to quit, experts said. It's a stealthy way of reducing headcount without having explicit layoffs, they said. "Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome," Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump tapped to lead a new advisory board dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency, wrote in a November op-ed. On Monday, Ramaswamy told CNBC he was leaving DOGE to run for governor of Ohio. Of course, there are also trade-offs to remote work for businesses and workers. About 59% of employers cite concerns that remote work harms company culture, according to ZipRecruiter. About half of workers — 53% — who work from home at least part time say it "hurts" their ability to feel connected with co-workers, Pew found in a 2023 poll. "It's the one big downside we've seen consistently," Parker said. "That seems to be a tradeoff: You get the work-life balance but lose some connectivity with coworkers," Parker said. Even if workers quit, they may not be able to find a job. The labor market remains strong, with low unemployment and low levels of layoffs, meaning workers have good job security, according to economists. However, companies have also pulled back on hiring, making it a challenging environment for job seekers. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Is Quantum Computing Investable As The Next AI ?

quantum computer The boom and bust and re-boom in quantum computing stocks over the last few weeks (look for example at the price gain and collapse and re-gain of RGTI, QBTS, QUBT, IONQ and others) has drawn comments from analysts that, on the one hand, equate quantum computing with a “bubble,” and on the other hand compare it with the early days of AI. Questions include: How far can quantum computing go? Can it challenge classical computing in the near future? Are quantum computing stocks worth investing in? Is one of these companies, or maybe one that is not even a company yet, but just in the heads of physicists somewhere in one of the tech universities around the world, the next big thing? Is this a lot of hocus pocus or a computational paradigm that might blow current capabilities out of the water and make NVDA look like, well, Intel of prior years? Investing in quantum computing is additionally scary today because the price of quantum computing stocks is being driven by both speculative instinct and the opinions of some of the rock stars of the AI revolution, who, if I may say so, probably do not know much more than the rest of us when it comes to forecasting the potential power and timing of when the strategy may become practical. One might be forgiven for thinking that comments regarding the near-term viability of quantum computing by Jensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg from a few weeks ago are somewhat self-serving, looking to protect their turf from a potential new game-changing technology, though in fairness they are also quite involved in pushing the frontiers of quantum computing technology. For sure, if Nvidia has ushered in exponential growth in computational power behind AI, then the potential of quantum computing, which can provide a “double exponential” speedup in computation (this is known as Neven’s law), will make classical computing based on even the fastest NVDA GPUs look linear. And there are good reasons why NVDA cannot just come out and say quantum is the next big thing, because doing so would likely decimate the market for their current chips and the profitability that has propelled it to be the most valuable company in the world (as of the date of this writing). In the world of computing, linear speedup, even relatively speaking, is considered an insult, because quantum computing theoretically has the potential of not just exponential, but a “double exponential” speedup. So, the simple answer to whether practical quantum computing is on the horizon in the near future is that no one really knows. It is similar to the task of predicting the probability that a meteor will hit the earth over the next decade. We simply don’t know. But that should not prevent us from being somewhat prepared. To me, the real question is not whether practical quantum computing will happen in the next few years, but what are the consequences if it does, and how, as an investor can I rationally position myself for the rare but impactful consequences. The physical laws behind quantum computing are on solid ground, unlike many other fads like negative interest rates that were implemented in Germany, or perpetual motion machines of eras past. First, let us put some confusion to rest. There is already a “practical” quantum computer in operation today. As a matter of fact, it has been in operation for as long as our physical world has existed. Yes, current physics says that nature is a massive quantum computer. I did my Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics, in the area of Quantum Field Theory, which strangely enough, works amazingly well in explaining the real world. The fact that nature seems to obey the rules of quantum mechanics all the way down to elementary particles and beyond is now beyond doubt. I also had the distinct pleasure of being at Caltech around the time that Nobel laureate Richard Feynman started to seriously think about quantum computers and around when he uttered the famous quote that “Nature isn’t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you’d better make it quantum mechanical”. In other words, even the fastest NVDA chips only get you a classical approximation to the real thing when it comes to simulation. It is akin to trying to simulate the nature of sub-atomic particles by applying Newton’s laws to smaller and faster bouncing balls. At some point the classical simulation will just fail because bouncing balls will never be able to replicate the peculiar quantum mechanical laws obeyed by sub-atomic particles. There are indeed problems today, though somewhat academic, that are practically impossible for classical computers to solve. As far as practicality goes, let’s not forget that the period between when proclamations were made that humans could not fly to when airplanes showed it could be done was quite short. What it took was a change of mindset and the development of a parallel framework - humans fly in planes by understanding the basic principles of aerodynamics, not by flapping their wings like birds. The quantum approach to computing will also develop parallel ways of solving the problems of computation, and they cannot be extrapolated from classical ways of computing. Its a new paradigm, and new paradigms can quickly shatter the constraints of old paradigms. After close to three decades of research, quantum computers have been built that can theoretically solve problems that cannot be solved on a classical computer (see the discussion of “quantum supremacy,” and a more sober look in light of recent claims by the Google team here by one of my other professors from Caltech, the theoretical physicist John Preskill), and the question now is not whether quantum computers that can exceed current classical computing is possible, but how hard really the current problems like error correction are. Impossible is bad, hard is good! The history of human innovation is that when the possibility of a game-changing technology exists, the speed at which hard problems become easier to solve is much faster than linear thinking allows us to imagine. When the rate at which the innovation — i.e. quantum computing’s rate of growth — is doubly exponential, not just exponential, the possibility of missing the inflection point is very real. And much of the acceleration in such situations also comes from incumbents who are competing amongst themselves for the next big thing. No wonder that after tanking quantum computing stocks, NVDA announced a” Quantum Day” at its GTC conference on March 20 (here). To me, it seems that the commercial race is already on, though it might be beneficial to do the development in stealth mode for most so they don’t get crushed out of their path to progress. This brings me to investability. Stock market investing is always risky, and speculative stock-market investing, as in quantum computing stocks (or AI, turn-of-the-century dot-coms or Bitcoin not too long ago), is doubly risky. But the upside compensation for taking the risk can also be large, which might justify a thoughtful, carefully considered, small allocation, to moonshot investments. The precise modeling of potential gains and losses for such speculative investments is basically impossible. At the simplest level, one can simply think of investing in such stocks as a biased coin flip experiment, where the odds of the coin flip coming up heads — i.e. a “win” is some number you make up — and the odds of the stock going belly up (i.e. price falling to zero), is one minus that number. An unbiased coin would have a probability of coming up heads or coming up tails to be equal or 50%. What makes things even more tricky is that these odds are dynamic and ever-changing, and can be subject to the opinions of experts who also know very little about the future but still have influence on pricing. Which means that proper sizing, or allocation of capital, is one of the only ways to ensure that one can stay the course, “HODL,” and not be shaken out. The mathematics of biased coin-flip betting is well known. As a matter of fact, it forms the foundation of all option pricing. For our purposes here let us imagine that the coin we are tossing has a very low probability of coming up heads. If this probability is labelled p, then the expected value, or average return over many such bets, assuming equal payoffs in the win and the loss states, is simply equal to p. So if the probability of success is 10% on one trial, then over many independent trials, the expected payoff can be estimated by multiplying 10% by the payoff if there is success. The lower the probability of success, the lower the expected value. Just like lottery tickets which have a very low probability of success, the expected value of speculative stock investing is very low. But that’s not the end of the story. As one would expect, both lottery tickets and speculative stocks have massive “skewness” and “kurtosis” when the probability of success is low, despite having very low expected value. Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of payoffs, and kurtosis is a measure of how “fat” the tail is. For a coin toss with probability of success p, the skewness and kurtosis both go to infinity when the probability of success is very low. This should not be a shocking result — we all know how low probability investments, e.g. bitcoin, can deliver massive returns (just recall bitcoin’s experience over the last few years). While it is easy to pooh pooh those dumb souls who bet on fat right tails, or lottery ticket-like investments, the fact of the matter is that such investments can make life-changing impact for investors, if they are made at a time when the price is not already discounting the massive positive returns. For a stock bought cheaply enough, this upside potential can counter the low expected return. Also note that both the skewness and kurtosis for a coin toss is minimum when the risks are balanced; i.e. the probability of success and failure are equal to 50% each. The danger of investing in such speculative investments arises from taking on too much exposure. This is because a low probability of success effectively guarantees that on average, returns will be low or negative. So, the bet one is making really is that by investing at the right price, the potential of outsized gains on the winners makes up for the almost certain losses on the losers. Again, as most readers undoubtedly know or have read, the optimal exposure that maximizes the long term growth rate of simple binary investments is given by the almost too simple (and magical) Kelly criterion (see here) which says that the optimal fraction to invest is simply p-(1-p)/b, where b are the odds upon success. For example, if one bets a dollar and upon a win is returned three dollars, and upon a loss loses the one dollar he bet, then b=2. So, we can see that if the probability of success is very low, then the payoff has to be very high for a profitable bet to be possible. If the payoff is not high enough then the optimal allocation must be very small. Let us calibrate this to investing in quantum computing. If we believe that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computation, then it is not hard to imagine a 100 to 1 payoff though it could take years for this to happen. So, if the probability of success is 5% , then the “optimal” fraction to bet at this enormous potential payout is about 4% of the portfolio. In this example, the investor should bet nothing if the potential payoff is less than about 19 times (obtained by dividing the probability of failure which is 95% by the probability of success which is 5%). In its current state, no one knows which type of quantum computing technology and which company will succeed. So, it also behooves the investor to divvy up the total allocation amongst many different technologies. Clearly, I take the view that quantum computing is very risky but investable, regardless of what the talking heads say, as long as there is potential for massive upside, the entry price is right, and as long as the exposure is kept small enough to not create a situation where the investor is forced out at the wrong time. The gut wrenching 50% decline in one day on an off-the-cuff comment by Jensen Huang last week illustrates that those who had positions too large or leveraged probably got forced out at the wrong price, creating the buying opportunity for those who were able to step in at the right size. At the end of the day, sizing exposures is probably as important, if not more important than getting the direction of investments right for any investment. In the case of highly speculative moonshots like quantum computing stocks, sizing things right — i.e. big enough but not too big —and owning the upside, skewness and the kurtosis, is probably the approach that balances out the risks with the potential of outsized returns. Just as there are catastrophic “left tails” which can destroy value, there are also “right tails”, which, if not managed for, can create massive missed opportunities. Like they say — you have to be “in it to win it.” Just be careful how much you risk. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

For our purposes here let us imagine that the coin we are tossing has a very low probability of coming up heads. If this probability is labelled p, then the expected value, or average return over many such bets, assuming equal payoffs in the win and the loss states, is simply equal to p. So if the probability of success is 10% on one trial, then over many independent trials, the expected payoff can be estimated by multiplying 10% by the payoff if there is success. The lower the probability of success, the lower the expected value. Just like lottery tickets which have a very low probability of success, the expected value of speculative stock investing is very low. But that’s not the end of the story. As one would expect, both lottery tickets and speculative stocks have massive “skewness” and “kurtosis” when the probability of success is low, despite having very low expected value. Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of payoffs, and kurtosis is a measure of how “fat” the tail is. For a coin toss with probability of success p, the skewness and kurtosis both go to infinity when the probability of success is very low. This should not be a shocking result — we all know how low probability investments, e.g. bitcoin, can deliver massive returns (just recall bitcoin’s experience over the last few years). While it is easy to pooh pooh those dumb souls who bet on fat right tails, or lottery ticket-like investments, the fact of the matter is that such investments can make life-changing impact for investors, if they are made at a time when the price is not already discounting the massive positive returns. For a stock bought cheaply enough, this upside potential can counter the low expected return. Also note that both the skewness and kurtosis for a coin toss is minimum when the risks are balanced; i.e. the probability of success and failure are equal to 50% each. The danger of investing in such speculative investments arises from taking on too much exposure. This is because a low probability of success effectively guarantees that on average, returns will be low or negative. So, the bet one is making really is that by investing at the right price, the potential of outsized gains on the winners makes up for the almost certain losses on the losers. Again, as most readers undoubtedly know or have read, the optimal exposure that maximizes the long term growth rate of simple binary investments is given by the almost too simple (and magical) Kelly criterion (see here) which says that the optimal fraction to invest is simply p-(1-p)/b, where b are the odds upon success. For example, if one bets a dollar and upon a win is returned three dollars, and upon a loss loses the one dollar he bet, then b=2. So, we can see that if the probability of success is very low, then the payoff has to be very high for a profitable bet to be possible. If the payoff is not high enough then the optimal allocation must be very small. Let us calibrate this to investing in quantum computing. If we believe that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computation, then it is not hard to imagine a 100 to 1 payoff though it could take years for this to happen. So, if the probability of success is 5% , then the “optimal” fraction to bet at this enormous potential payout is about 4% of the portfolio. In this example, the investor should bet nothing if the potential payoff is less than about 19 times (obtained by dividing the probability of failure which is 95% by the probability of success which is 5%). In its current state, no one knows which type of quantum computing technology and which company will succeed. So, it also behooves the investor to divvy up the total allocation amongst many different technologies. Clearly, I take the view that quantum computing is very risky but investable, regardless of what the talking heads say, as long as there is potential for massive upside, the entry price is right, and as long as the exposure is kept small enough to not create a situation where the investor is forced out at the wrong time. The gut wrenching 50% decline in one day on an off-the-cuff comment by Jensen Huang last week illustrates that those who had positions too large or leveraged probably got forced out at the wrong price, creating the buying opportunity for those who were able to step in at the right size. At the end of the day, sizing exposures is probably as important, if not more important than getting the direction of investments right for any investment. In the case of highly speculative moonshots like quantum computing stocks, sizing things right — i.e. big enough but not too big —and owning the upside, skewness and the kurtosis, is probably the approach that balances out the risks with the potential of outsized returns. Just as there are catastrophic “left tails” which can destroy value, there are also “right tails”, which, if not managed for, can create massive missed opportunities. Like they say — you have to be “in it to win it.” Just be careful how much you risk. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Amazon reportedly resumes green-card applications under Trump
URL: https://qz.com/amazon-green-card-applications-trump-pledge-promise-rto-1851746418

Amazon (AMZN+1.79%) has reportedly restarted the application process for foreign workers to obtain green cards, Business Insider first reported, citing an internal memo from last year. The company resumed processing on Jan. 6, after a two-year pause in which the company suspended new PERM filings. While Amazon hasn’t provided a specific reason for resuming the program, it’s likely part of its plan to prepare for a more competitive labor market. The PERM, or Program Electronic Review Management process, impacts foreign workers who are seeking green cards. It requires companies to prove that hiring foreign employees won’t harm job opportunities or wages for U.S. workers. The process is both time-consuming – taking between 2 to 3 years – and expensive, with costs ranging from $2,500 to $20,000. Amazon’s decision to restart the PERM process comes as it scales back its operations in Canada. Earlier this week, the company announced the closure of seven warehouses in Quebec, alongside layoffs that impact nearly 2,000 workers. Amazon has eliminated more 27,000 roles across different departments from late 2022 onward. Earlier this month, it also laid off 200 employees from its Fashion and Fitness division. Despite these cuts, the resumption of green-card filings suggests Amazon may be seeking global talent to meet its future growth goals. The move appears to align with President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to offer green cards to all foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges, which could further expand Amazon’s potential talent pool. The tech giant is the second largest U.S. employer, behind Walmart (WMT+0.16%). This potential shif coincides with Amazon’s push for employees to return to the office. The company has warned that failure to comply with its return-to-office (RTO) policy could lead to termination. However, Amazon is having a tough time meeting office-space requirements for its sprawling workforce. Initially, Amazon planned for all employees to return to the office five days a week starting Jan. 2, 2025, but some locations are not yet prepared to accommodate the full staff.

Title: IP in the Octagon: Saving Live Sports from Digital Piracy

Time Published: 2025-01-23T17:15:30Z
Full Content:
January 23, 2025, 12:15 PM 0 Share IPWatchdog LIVE Moves to March in 2025: “Growth metrics for platforms like Starzplay will remain stagnant unless legal frameworks, technological innovation, and skilled IP professionals converge to reshape the landscape of content distribution in the region.” The evolution of content distribution has been both a boon and a bane for the entertainment industry. From physical formats like CDs and DVDs to digital streaming over satellite, fiber-optic networks, 5G, and Wi-Fi, the rapid technological advancements have brought unmatched convenience to viewers. The shift feels seamless: connect a smart TV to Wi-Fi, and the days of waiting for the cable guy are over. For television show producers, however, the transition has come at a steep cost. Take, for instance, the creators and distributors of movies and live premium events. They have seen their revenue streams severely impacted, not immediately but gradually, as digital platforms opened doors to new vulnerabilities. In the past, the model was straightforward: install a satellite dish, pay a subscription, and gain access to live sports and Hollywood movies. Today, it’s a different story. Consumers can share Wi-Fi costs with neighbors or, worse, bypass paywalls entirely by typing “watch UFC live for free” into a search engine. Within seconds, dozens of links appear, granting free access to what should have been an $80 pay-per-view event. Let’s look at the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a massively profitable martial arts promotion company. Despite its financial success, it is losing a significant amount of revenue to piracy. UFC CEO Dana White has repeatedly highlighted the massive challenges piracy creates, often calling out illegal streaming platforms and warning of legal action. Yet, pirates just laugh and openly mock these threats. One even tweeted in response to White: “Come and get it then, Dana. He’s desperate, making up lies and praying it scares away a few hundred people from clicking the link.” The challenges for content creators like the UFC are twofold. First, the market for pirated streams thrives because many fans either cannot or will not pay for legitimate access. Studies show that about 11% of U.S. adults admit to pirating live sports, TV, or movies, citing high costs as the primary reason. For millennials, the percentage climbs even higher, with nearly two-thirds acknowledging they’ve watched sports through unofficial streams. This behavior has real economic consequences. The Harvard Business Review estimates that piracy costs the global sports industry approximately $28 billion annually. The losses trickle down in ways many consumers don’t consider. Players, for example, have collective bargaining agreements that tie salaries to league revenues. When TV revenue declines due to piracy, salary caps tighten, directly impacting athlete earnings. It’s not just high-profile athletes who suffer; ordinary Americans employed by league media arms or regional sports networks also face layoffs when subscription and advertising revenue drops. The perception that piracy is a victimless crime ignores these broader realities. The second challenge lies in outdated copyright laws. The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 places the burden of enforcement on content creators. This notice-and-takedown system requires creators to identify infringements and report them to online service providers (OSPs), who are then expected to act “expeditiously.” But the definition of “expeditiously” is vague and varies by case. UFC executive vice president Riché T. McKnight testified before Congress in 2023 that some OSPs take hours or even days to remove pirated content. By that time, the economic damage is done. Failing to combat piracy risks losing an entire continent of viewers. This stark reality underscores the urgent need for innovative approaches to intellectual property rights and content distribution. The Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, boasts a rich history of martial arts and warrior traditions deeply embedded in its cultural identity. Combat sports such as wrestling and grappling have longstanding roots in the region, with practices like Koshti Pahlavani and Yagli Gures exemplifying traditions of martial honor and prowess. In Saudi Arabia, these practices often intertwine with Islamic values, framing martial arts as both physical disciplines and pathways to spiritual and personal development, frequently influenced by Sufi teachings. It’s no surprise, then, that combat sports have a significant audience in the Middle East. But while people in the region enjoy watching martial arts on television, the question remains: are they willing to pay for it? In April 2024, the UFC partnered with Starzplay to secure exclusive broadcasting rights in the Middle East and North Africa. Starzplay’s dedicated UFC channel promised comprehensive access to UFC content through its mobile application. Yet, did this strategic move meet expectations? The results suggest otherwise. Starzplay’s subscriber base remains modest at 2.9 million. By comparison, ESPN+ boasts 25.6 million subscribers, while Amazon Prime has reached a staggering 200 million. To put it bluntly, the initiative fell far short of expectations. The root of the issue lies in entrenched habits and a lack of a robust culture surrounding intellectual property rights. Changing the way viewers consume content requires more than exclusive deals; it demands a concerted effort to foster respect for legal streaming. Only a new culture of intellectual property management can transform these habits. Growth metrics for platforms like Starzplay will remain stagnant unless legal frameworks, technological innovation, and skilled IP professionals converge to reshape the landscape of content distribution in the region. Conventional business models in sports and premium television inadvertently facilitate content leakage, especially during live sports broadcasts. Current security measures, such as fingerprinting or watermarking technologies, are ineffective. It could be argued that within the context of news media distribution, video streaming represents a vital aspect of critical infrastructure, making it susceptible to malicious software attacks. In one example where the FBI disarmed a malware called Emotet, the agency explained how the malware worked: Usually delivered through an infected email attachment or link, the nimble and ever mutating code was able to slip past most virus detection software”. The concept of “appointment viewing”—television programming that individuals prioritize to watch during its original broadcast time due to a strong desire to witness events within the specified timeframe—exposes live sports content to significant risks of intellectual property (IP) rights violations. Sports leagues and media conglomerates stand to lose substantial audiences within minutes. This is due to the brief time it takes for viewers to search for alternative, unauthorized, free, or very cheap streams to watch live games or UFC fights. Preventing such leaks is time-critical, as audience interest rapidly declines once a live event concludes. Content is particularly vulnerable to unauthorized live redistribution while a sporting event is in progress. Is the centralization of video distribution the problem here? In traditional a video streaming platform, where one of the users pays for using the platform nothing stops that person to redistribute that televised live sport event. With the help of blockchain, the issue of ownership can be addressed at a protocol level. Blockchain helps the creators and the audience encrypt their videos and store those videos permanently using the IPFS swarm. Blockchain broadcasts the live sporting event in an autonomous manner with the help of various relay nodes and IPFS, thereby maintaining transparency and integrity of ownership in a decentralized way. It echoes overall U.S. Government strategy. The United States acknowledges the potential inherent in the modernization of its cryptographic technologies, which shall now encompass blockchain technology and its capacity to augment security and transparency. As the former U.S. Presidential Administration has explained, “digital connectivity should be a tool that uplifts and empowers people everywhere, not one used for repression and coercion.” Per the National Cybersecurity Strategy, “new and updated cybersecurity regulations must be calibrated to meet the needs of national security and public safety, in addition to the security and safety of individuals, regulated entities, and their employees, customers, operations, and data.” Implementing blockchain technology will inevitably help sport broadcasting giants to grow subscription numbers. Once streaming sporting event is “live”, the blocks, which are stored on a multitude of servers throughout the world, cannot be changed. As a result, sport Leagues and producers of the live broadcasts will have total control over their work. Blockchain-based television streaming systems is a new generation of digital infrastructure, that offer transparency through decentralization, allowing participating parties to verify data and transactions, avoid harmful cyber incidents. It is an example of “sector-specific engagement with industry to construct consistent, predictable regulatory frameworks for cybersecurity that focus on achieving security outcomes and enabling continuity of operations and functions, while promoting collaboration and innovation”. Put simply, it is a matter of national interest. The journey of the UFC in the Middle East illustrates the importance of live streaming in a region where cultural appreciation for combat sports runs deep. With smart TVs becoming increasingly accessible—not just in developed nations but globally—the potential audience for live sports is enormous. We stand at a crossroads. One path leads to chaos—a world where video pirates evolve into organized crime syndicates, dominating the streaming landscape. The other path offers a vision of fairness and innovation: a distributed network governed by blockchain technology, fostering harmony between creators and consumers.

Title: Amazon resumes new US green card applications for foreign workers, leaked memo shows
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-reopens-green-card-applications-for-foreign-workers-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-23T16:59:50Z

Amazon has resumed the green-card application process for foreign workers, a sign of an improving job market. In an internal note from late 2024, obtained by Business Insider, Amazon told employees that it planned to reopen PERM processing on January 6. Amazon had suspended all new PERM filings in 2023 and throughout 2024, citing "labor market conditions," BI previously reported. PERM is part of the US Labor Department's permanent labor certification process and is typically the first step toward getting a green card for a foreign worker. The goal is to prove that hiring foreign workers won't affect US job seekers' opportunities, wages, or working conditions. The note didn't explain why Amazon was resuming the PERM process. But the change may reflect Amazon's outlook for a more competitive job market. It also follows Donald Trump's campaign proposal to give green cards to foreign graduates of US colleges. "We evaluate our PERM program based on market analysis and have been planning to reopen it for the last 9 months," Amazon's spokesperson said in an email to BI. Amazon has been making major job cuts since late 2022, laying off at least 27,000 employees. Just last week Amazon let go about 200 people in its fashion and fitness group, BI reported. Richard Herman, a Cleveland-based immigration lawyer who founded the Herman Legal Group, said that resuming PERM filings indicates Amazon sees a possible "rebound" in the job market. Herman said some companies previously suspended green-card filings because of widespread layoffs and the cost and time required to process PERMs with the Labor Department. With PERM, companies have to demonstrate that laid-off employees aren't qualified for the jobs intended for foreign workers while also notifying US workers laid off within the past six months of the anticipated PERM filing. That takes a lot of money and time. "If employers are reconsidering getting back into the PERM game, it's because their cost/benefit analysis suggests labor market changes favor a more competitive market in some occupations, justifying the costs/time invested in PERM," Herman said. Tech companies are still laying off employees and applying more stringent performance reviews. But the hiring trend may improve. The HR-software maker Karat said in a 2024 report that the average hiring target for software engineer roles among US tech companies was up by 12% year over year. Stripe laid off 300 employees this week but said it planned to grow its total head count by roughly 1,000 this year, BI previously reported. "Tech in the Bay Area is definitely hiring more, and so they have a positive view of what's ahead," Bill Hing, an immigration law professor at the University of San Francisco, told BI. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he'd like to give green cards to every foreign graduate of US colleges as part of a plan to attract more skilled immigrants. That has led to a clash between the Elon Musk-led pro-Trump tech leaders and the hardcore MAGA base over the legal immigration of skilled workers. While it's possible Trump will commit to his proposal, he hasn't publicly addressed it since, and he could change his mind. Trump's campaign clarified last year that his proposal would apply only to the "most thoroughly vetted" foreign students. Jennifer Gordon, a labor and immigration law professor at Fordham University, told BI that companies might be trying to anticipate Trump's unpredictable behavior. Given Trump's past hard-line stance against immigration, Gordon said it's possible the new administration would issue a policy pausing skilled labor immigration applications in the future. "If I was a tech company, I wouldn't be fully confident that he will follow through," Gordon said. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip?

US stocks faltered on Thursday, pulling back from a bid for fresh records as AI optimism waned and markets waited for more detail on President Donald Trump's tariff plans. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.2% higher, with a record high not far off. Meanwhile, The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped, as fellow megacap techs Apple (AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) also lost ground. Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit. The focus is now on Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos later Thursday for more insight into his trade policy. Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Shares in Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) edged lower after business shifts by the tech leaders in Canada, a prime tariff target for Trump. The e-commerce giant will close its warehouses in Quebec, with a loss of about 1,700 jobs, while Tesla plans hefty price hikes on all its EV models sold in Canada. Eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set that tone on Wednesday. GE Aerospace (GE) shares popped after the jet engine maker said it will raise share buybacks to $7 billion. In air carriers, American Airlines (AAL) stock slid after a downbeat 2025 profit forecast, and Alaska Airlines (ALK) shares rose thanks to a smaller-than-expected first quarter loss forecast. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to poor performance of two of its video games: its soccer title, EA Sports FC 2025, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Both of those missed expectations. The company cut its bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. EA is expected to release its complete results on February 4. US stocks were mixed on Thursday, pulling back from near record levels as the markets awaited a speech from President trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped roughly 0.2%, coming off a record intraday high on Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks were mixed Thursday as investors stayed attuned to remarks from President Donald Trump, who addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.6% higher, with a record not far off. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell around 0.2% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped after its supplier SK Hynix (000660.KS) flagged uncertainty about chip demand this year, which also weighed on other related stocks. The focus turned to Trump's remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos for more insight into his trade policy. The president said he will "demand that interest rates drop immediately." He also said he will ask OPEC to bring down the price of oil. On the tariff front, the president offered a warning to companies. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff." Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit. Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Meanwhile, eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set the stage for next week's Big Tech flurry. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. President Trump said he will ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia to bring down the price of oil. "I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down," said Trump during his remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately. Right now the price is high enough that that war will continue, you've got to bring down the oil price. You've got to end that war," he said. Russia, a major producer of oil and gas, is an OPEC ally. The cartel currently has production cuts in place in order to keep a floor on prices. Both West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) fell roughly 1% following Trump's comments. President Trump said he will demand that interest rates drop in the US. "I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us,” Trump said remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved to a session high, up 0.5% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell slightly. President Trump spoke remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, appearing via video to a packed room of CEOs and world officials. The President first listed a series of actions he took upon entering the White House, including withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and declaring a national energy emergency. On the topic of tariffs, the President said: "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth." "But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff. Attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos are waiting for President Trump's special address via video. Investors watching the remote speech will pay attention to any talk about the President's tariff policy. President Trump will also take questions after his remarks. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose after Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a post on X that she will chair the Senate Banking Subcommittee on digital assets. The token moved up to about $105,000 at around 10:50 a.m. ET. Earlier this week, Lummis said she spoke with Eric Trump about the possibility of creating a strategic bitcoin reserve at the inaugural lunch on Monday. Late last year, she introduced a proposal that would give the Federal Reserve the right to own the cryptocurren. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Chip stocks fell across the board early on Thursday after a Nvidia (NVDA) supplier made comments on its earnings call that indicated uncertainty about semiconductor demand this year. South Korea-based SK Hynix (000660.KS) makes memory chips for Nvidia’s GPUs (graphics processing units), which are used in data centers to underpin artificial intelligence software. After SK Hynix reported fourth quarter earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations, its head of finance, Woo-Hyun Kim, painted a careful picture of the year ahead. “2025's memory demand outlook is clouded by inventory adjustments from PC and smartphone OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] as well as strengthened protective trade policies and geopolitical risks,” Kim said on a post-earnings conference call. Following the comments, Nvidia shares sank as much as 2%. British chip designer Arm's (ARM) stock dropped nearly 6%, and SK Hynix rival Micron (MU) shares fell roughly 4%. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports from Davos: Up and down the promenade at the World Economic Forum this week, leaders agree on one thing about artificial intelligence: It's darn powerful, and it's starting to materially impact how business is done and will be done. Think AI on the cusp of rendering human call centers and HR departments obsolete. What leaders can't agree on is whether AI is already out of control — whether it's beyond the point of being successfully regulated or having the proper guardrails. "I'm not sure it's [AI] out of control. I think there are use cases that sometimes people want to showcase [for] ... their own benefits, to see, hey, this is the potential. But the reality is that enterprises are very smart," HPE CEO Antonio Neri told Yahoo Finance at the annual gathering of top business leaders. Read more here. American Airlines (AAL) stock fell nearly 8% after the carrier forecast a surprise loss for its first quarter. The outlook is a departure from the major air travel carriers' bullish performance in recent quarters. American expects an adjusted loss of as much as $0.40 a share for the current quarter. Analysts were expecting a profit of at least $0.01, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The airline posted record fourth quarter revenue of $13.7 billion and record full-year revenue of $54.2 billion. The company's profit for the current quarter is expected to be impacted by a rise in non-fuel expenses as it continues to win back business after changing its corporate sales strategy. American had implemented changes that pushed corporate customers to book directly with the airline, instead of third-party travel managers. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to the poor performance of two of its video games: soccer title "EA Sports FC 2025" and "Dragon Age: The Veilguard." Both of those missed bookings expectations. The company cut its bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. EA is expected to release its complete results on Feb. 4. US stocks were mixed on Thursday, pulling back from near record levels as the markets awaited a speech from President Trump at the World Economic Forum. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped roughly 0.2%, coming off a record intraday high on Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.5% as tech stocks struggled. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slipped, along with those of Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).

Title: Google-backed, AI-developed drugs are headed to trial by 2026, DeepMind CEO says

Drugs developed by Alphabet’s drug discovery subsidiary and designed by artificial intelligence are expected to head to trial by the end of the year, according to a Google (GOOGL+1.70%) executive. “AI applied to science is a lot richer than just the language models,” Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and the founder of Isomorphic Labs during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday. “We’ll hopefully have some AI-designed drugs in the clinic by the end of the year. That’s the plan,” he added. The four-year-old Isomorphic Labs was spun off from DeepMind in 2021 as a stand-alone subsidiary under Alphabet. In July, it announced deals to work on research with Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY-0.14%) and Novartis (NVS-1.44%) to leverage its AI technology — namely AlphaFold, its model that predicts a protein’s 3D structure — to discover therapeutics against multiple targets. “We’re looking at oncology, cardiovascular, neurodegeneration, all the big disease areas, and I think by the end of this year, we’ll have our first drug,” Hassabis told The Financial Times on Tuesday. But Isomorphic Labs isn’t the only company working on AI-designed drugs. Interest in leveraging AI to help quickly discover new treatments has been booming. “There’s a huge public health need to develop new antibiotics quickly,” Stanford University Professor James Zou, who used generative AI to help creature structures and chemical recipes for six drugs, said last year. “Our hypothesis was that there are a lot of potential molecules out there that could be effective drugs, but we haven’t made or tested them yet,” he added. “That’s why we wanted to use AI to design entirely new molecules that have never been seen in nature.” Insilico Medicine, a Hong Kong-based startup with offices in New York and Boston, became the first company to send an AI-designed drug to clinical trials in 2023. The drug, INS018_055, was designed to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the most common type of pulmonary fibrosis, a disease that causes scarring on the lungs. There’s currently no cure for the disease, according to the United Kingdom’s National Health Service. Trials are still ongoing, but Insilico in November said topline results from its study showed positive results. Earlier this month, Insilico released positive topline results from two phase 1 trials of an AI-designed drug meant to help people with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The startup also said researchers had used its AI-driven platform to identify potential treatments for endometriosis.

Title: CNN boss Mark Thompson confirms 200 layoffs across cable TV network in digital push
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/01/23/business/cnn-boss-mark-thompson-confirms-200-layoffs-in-digital-push/
Time Published: 2025-01-23T14:03:23Z
Full Content:
CNN boss Mark Thompson on Thursday revealed sweeping changes at the embattled network that include 200 job cuts and a pivot to a more digital-centric strategy, the company said. The layoffs at the Warner Bros Discovery-owned network will amount to 6% of CNN’s workforce – mainly producers, editors and other non-air talent vital to the TV operation. Thompson, the former New York Times executive who pushed the Gray Lady toward a digital future, laid out his vision for a revamped CNN in an internal memo obtained by The Post. “Our objective is a simple one: to shift CNN’s gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting,” Thompson wrote. As part of the overhaul, Thompson confirmed reports earlier in the week that veteran anchor Wolf Blitzer will be moved from his afternoon slot to host a morning show with Pamela Brown at 10 a.m. – a decision that will cost frequent Donald Trump critic Jim Acosta his morning gig. Acosta is expected to be exiled to a midnight shift, a decision that has left him fuming and reportedly threatening to quit. With the job cuts, CNN seeks to streamline its cable TV lineup and enhance its digital subscription offerings to better align with evolving viewer trends. Thompson said CNN has started development on a new streaming service for news programming similar to its TV product. CNN also plans to launch a new lifestyle-oriented product this year, the memo said, adding that CNN is looking to open up and fill at least 100 new posts in the coming months as part of the shift to digital. “Some of today’s announcements mean significant new job opportunities at CNN, but others will lead to the loss of some valued colleagues,” Thompson wrote in the memo. “That too is an unwelcome but inevitable part of the change process.” CNN declined to comment. NBC News, owned by Comcast, also announced job cuts late Thursday that are reportedly expected to include up to a few dozens staffers. In October, CNN introduced a digital paywall requiring some users to pay $3.99 per month for access to its content. The move aimed to create a new digital revenue stream as the network looks to offset the decline in TV. The digital efforts were financed by a $70 million investment from WBD, Thompson added.

Never miss a story. “This is a moment where the digital story feels like an existential question,” Thompson told the New York Times. “If we do not follow the audiences to the new platforms with real conviction and scale, our future prospects will not be good.” Warner Bros Discovery is undergoing significant restructuring and said last month that it plans to split its cable TV networks from its streaming and studio operations, forming two separate units. Under the new structure, the cable TV business — including CNN, TNT and Animal Planet — will be consolidated into a unit named Global Linear Networks. “In the end, this is about CNN being — as it has been in its history — an indispensable way in which many, many millions of people get their news,” Thompson told the Times. The shakeup comes as CNN – which has attempted to tack toward the center since WBD acquired the network in a merger in 2022 – lags far behind cable rivals Fox News and left-leaning MSNBC. CNN’s viewership has only gotten worse since Trump won the election and its web traffic has also suffered, hitting a two-year low in December, according to analytics firm Comscore. The network recorded 90.5 million unique visits that month – down from a peak of 175.5 million in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, the firm said. CNN told the Times other news networks have seen similar declines. The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, said earlier this month it would lay off about 4% of its workforce or less than 100 employees in a bid to cut costs, as the storied newspaper grapples with growing losses. In November, the Associated Press said it would cut about 8% of its workforce as it looks to modernize its operations and products. Advertisement

Title: AI crypto coins take over: Is Trump’s $500B investment behind it all?

The future of crypto is AI—and it’s happening now. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has real-world applications across industries like business, technology, healthcare, and finance. The crypto sector is no exception, with AI-based tokens now commanding a market cap of $48 billion. Trump’s ‘no crypto’ stance may have rattled the broader market, but his $500 billion AI investment sent AI crypto coins soaring, with low-caps jumping 15% in 24 hours. Nvidia (NVDA) has now dethroned Apple (AAPL) as the world’s largest company, with a market cap soaring to $311 trillion – up 4.43% since Trump’s $500 billion AI investment. This is a clear sign that the AI revolution is taking off. AI-based crypto tokens aren’t far behind. In just two years, the market cap of AI-focused crypto coins surged by a massive 2,592%, reaching a staggering $70 billion by November last year. Leading the charge? NEAR Protocol [NEAR], boasting a solid market value of $5.89 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap But that’s just the beginning. Take Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), for instance, jumping into the ‘AI agent’ space, which Microsoft’s CEO just called the future of software development. Clearly, these coins are tapping into the tech to create real-world applications that are catching the eye of both individuals and institutional investors. However, the AI crypto market isn’t immune to volatility. In just two months, its market cap took a 31% dip, as the broader crypto market saw massive profit-taking. Can Trump’s $500 billion AI investment turn things around? Right now, Trump’s actions are shaking up the crypto world. Take the TRUMP memecoin, for example, which has seen billions in market cap vanish after Trump’s ‘no crypto’ stance in his first 42 executive orders. Bitcoin is also feeling the squeeze, with its market share down 7% to $2.02 trillion. And AI crypto coins? They’re not immune, with many slipping into the red. Source: CoinMarketCap But there’s hope on the horizon. Trump’s massive $500 billion investment could spark a major rebound for AI tokens. We’ve seen these coins surge after Nvidia’s quarterly reports in the past, and with AI sentiment at an all-time high in the U.S., the future looks promising. Read NEAR Protocol’s [NEAR] Price Prediction 2025–2026 The road ahead won’t be easy, though. AI crypto coins need to break free from Bitcoin’s volatility and carve out their own space. But with a 2592% growth in less than three years, they’re on the right track. As tech giants gear up for the AI revolution, more capital could flood into the AI crypto coins. 2025 could be their year – definitely one to watch.

Title: With 61% institutional ownership, Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a favorite amongst the big guns

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Altria Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 42% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business A look at the shareholders of Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 61% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Altria Group, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Altria Group Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Altria Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Altria Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Altria Group. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 4.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Altria Group, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$63m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 39% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Altria Group better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Altria Group (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.

Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) is the undisputed king of the meme coins, with a market cap of about $56 billion. The coin has been in a roaring rally since late last year, rising by 355%, and, with the Trump administration signaling a serious pro-crypto bent, it's no surprise that investors are interested in making big gains with a purchase. Is it possible to make a decent sum of $10,000 with a timely investment in this meme, even if your starting capital is on the small side? In the closing of the recent trading day, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) stood at $240.91, denoting a +0.25% change from the preceding trading day. The Nasdaq Composite gained 30% in 2024, while Ark Innovation ETF returned 8.4%. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) shares are trading lower on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reiterated the Buy rating on the stock, with a price forecast of $36. Halliburton reported a fourth-quarter revenue decline of 2.3% year-over-year to $5.610 billion, missing the consensus of $5.63 billion. Completion and Production revenue fell 4.2% YoY to $3.2 billion, with $629 million operating income. The analyst noted that softer revenue was mainly due to a decline in Completion and Produc Energy Transfer LP (ET) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com users lately. So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock. Advertising revenue doubled this past year, co-CEO Gregory Peters said, and the company expects the same to be true in 2025. Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup is facing renewed scrutiny on its strategy of backing loss-making electric vehicle maker VinFast, with its shares near multi-year lows as foreign investors sell and its borrowing costs rise. Pressure on the company, a household name in Vietnam with businesses spanning autos, real estate, retail and resorts, intensified this month as Moody's and Fitch gave 'junk' ratings to the debt of Vingroup's most profitable unit, real estate firm Vinhomes, as well as to its planned $500 million international bond sale. The two agencies said the speculative-grade ratings were due to Vinhomes' links to Vingroup. Vistra stock was rising Tuesday after authorities lifted evacuation orders issued because of a fire at a company power plant last week. The utility stock gained 8.8% to $185.83 in afternoon trading, on track for an all-time high, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The fire took place at a lithium-ion battery facility at a Vistra power plant in Moss Landing, Calif. Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to Super Micro (SMCI). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Amazon UK Boss Says “Greater Share” Of Prime Video TV Spend Shifting To Britain, But Streamer Would Never Have Commissioned ‘Mr Bates’
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/01/amazon-uk-commissioning-spend-mr-bates-lord-of-the-rings-1236263880/

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Prime Video is shifting a greater share of its overall TV spend to Britain, according to Amazon UK boss Chris Bird. Bird was speaking on a Royal Television Society (RTS) panel predicting the year in UK TV, alongside the likes of Fremantle UK boss Amelia Brown, who said the industry has “lost its guts a bit” when it comes to taking risks. Bird said Amazon commissioning budgets are “really healthy and strong” this year in Britain despite American contraction, and “as we go forward a greater share of investment at global level is centered here in the UK.” Last year, Amazon initiated a major international restructure that saw layoffs in the Africa and MENA regions as focus shifted to Europe, although there were also some European firings amid the downturn.

Go with your gut Bird was speaking on a panel alongside big hitters in the UK industry like Fremantle’s Brown, who delivered an impassioned plea for execs on both sides of the commissioning fence to take risks. “Our industry has maybe lost its guts a little bit [in terms of] going for what they believe in across the board,” she said. Brown cited BBC breakout The Traitors, which wraps up this week. “It got pitched around a few places and then the BBC said, ‘We will do it,’ so the gut instinct was there,” she explained. “Every broadcaster was then pitched versions of what we are now calling ‘psychological reality’. And that’s more on [producers] to say that derivatives and versions are never going to be the thing that hits so we need to go with our guts and with creativity.” Brown, who oversees the likes of The Apprentice, Britain’s Got Talent and Too Hot To Handle, said this is becoming trickier as young viewers disengage from traditional TV. With this in mind, BBC unscripted boss Kate Phillips argued the corporation’s biggest rival is no longer the streamers but is now YouTube, TikTok and gaming. “We want to grow love of the BBC with the young and they are becoming very distracted by these other platforms,” she added. “It’s about making them aware of the things we’ve got sometimes – a good show is a good show but it’s about getting [young people] off their devices and off YouTube.” The BBC is struggling to fund big-budget drama at present but Phillips said premium unscripted is not being hit in the same way due to its lower cost, although she is still busily seeking partnerships “We are not as reliant as drama is [on co-pro money] and can still fully fund programs but in terms of upping the ambition we are certainly open to partnerships,” she added, citing the BBC’s tie-up with NBC, which birthed The Traitors, and second window deals with the likes of BBC Studios-owned channel group UKTV. The trio were speaking in London at the RTS session. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

January 22, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Cassava Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ: SAVA), and MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff.

Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

(NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, clear confidence in simufilam’s ability to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. On November 25, 2024, Cassava released topline results for the first of its two ongoing Phase 3 studies on simufilam, the “ReThink-ALZ” study. The results indicated that simufilam failed to meet each of the pre-specified primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints; in sum, simufilam failed to outperform the placebo. Following this news, the price of Cassava’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $26.48 per share on November 22, 2024, Cassava’s stock price fell to $4.30 per share on November 25, 2024, a decline of about 83.76% in the span of just a single day.

Prior to the Class Period, sales of hard liquors, such as those produced and sold by MGPI, increased dramatically in the wake of COVID-19. However, as quarantines ended, sales of hard liquors slowed across the alcoholic beverage industry, and a backlog of inventory began to increase. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, MGPI falsely assured investors that its projections and statements accounted for the industry slowdown and that it was well-positioned to avoid a buildup of inventory. The Company also claimed that its projected sales took these industry trends into account. MGPI announced on October 17, 2024, that a slowdown in demand and an excess in inventories would undermine sales. This revelation caused the Company’s stock to plummet 29.5%. Then, less than two weeks later, on October 31, 2024, Defendants revealed that its excess inventory would have an even greater impact than previously reported. This caused the Company’s stock to drop another 14.7%, to a close of $49.04 per share on October 31, 2024. In total, MGPI’s share price declined nearly 50% on these two disclosures, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization and damaging investors.

Title: Why Amazon’s Decision in Quebec Raises Familiar Questions

Good e-Reader 22 January 2025 by Angela Waterfield 2 Comments Amazon recently announced it’s closing all its operations in Quebec.This move will cut about 1,950 jobs, including 1,700 full-time workers. The company says it’s shifting back to a third-party delivery model, claiming this will save customers money. But labor unions and critics are asking: Is this really about saving money, or is it about getting rid of unionized workers? This isn’t the first time Amazon’s decisions have raised eyebrows. In February 2023, I wrote about Amazon laying off 18,000 workers. At the time, the company blamed inflation, slowing sales, and supply chain issues. But many of us questioned whether those layoffs were more about automation and avoiding unions. What’s happening in Quebec now feels like history repeating itself. One of the sites closing is the DXT4 warehouse in Laval, Amazon’s first unionized warehouse in Canada. Workers there joined the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) in May 2024 and were negotiating their first contract when the closure was announced. The CSN says Amazon’s decision targets unionized workers and violates the Quebec Labour Code. Amazon denies any ill intentions and accuses the CSN of spreading false information. It’s worth noting that the CSN aren’t alone in wondering about this- as just last August, a Quebec labor tribunal ruled against Amazon for interfering in union efforts at another site in Lachine. Automation seems to play a big role in Amazon’s decisions. While the company hasn’t said the Quebec closures are about robots, it’s worth noting that Amazon has been building more robotic warehouses where machines do the work people used to do. There’s also the issue of unionization. Unionized workers typically earn around 10% more and receive more comprehensive benefits than their non-unionized counterparts. They’re also more likely to have better access to employer-sponsored health plans and paid sick days. For a company focused on minimizing costs, unionized workers may represent a financial challenge Amazon would rather avoid. By closing its only unionized warehouse in Canada, Amazon may be signaling a preference for non-unionized labor, where wages and benefits can remain lower. This pattern raises questions about whether cost-cutting decisions are being made under the guise of automation or operational efficiency while effectively undermining workers’ rights. Amazon says the switch to third-party delivery in Quebec is an operational decision. But the timing—right after unionization and during labor negotiations—feels off. Quebec’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, François-Philippe Champagne, came out criticizing the move, saying, “This is not the way business is done in Canada.” This isn’t just about Quebec or Canada for that matter. This trend is part of a larger story about how companies like Amazon are focusing on cutting costs and automating jobs, often at the expense of their workers. This story also highlights how hard it is for unions to protect workers in industries moving toward automation and AI. In my 2023 article, I wrote, “If you’re going to replace workers with robots because it’s cheaper and easier than dealing with unions, just be honest about it.” That still rings true. People appreciate transparency, and without it, companies risk losing the trust of their employees and customers. Amazon could take a different approach. It’s not impossible to invest in both technology and fair treatment for workers. Instead of seeing unions as the enemy, companies could work with them to find solutions that work for everyone. “Today’s workers need ongoing, incremental re-skilling or upskilling to maintain a stable or improving career path. Displaced workers need substantive retraining to get their next job or career. Young people entering the workforce need a foundation of skills aligned with their aptitudes and the prevailing demand for human labor.” – Yossi Sheffi Mark Twain once said, “If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.” Amazon’s actions in Quebec point towards a lack of transparency and honesty. Perhaps these closures have nothing to do with unions, but until they’re willing to be fully upfront on their reasoning, people will continue to ask tough questions about their motives. It doesn’t help that Amazon has a long history of questionable business practices and has been the subject of several lawsuits; including antitrust, class action, and lawsuits over product recall. Companies like Amazon need to realize that innovation and fairness can go hand in hand, and it’s time they start proving it.

Our armed forces stand as the ultimate protectors of our nation, braving unimaginable risks every day. It is only fitting that a centrally funded life and health insurance scheme be made mandatory for them at all levels—this is not just financial security, but a tribute to their unwavering service. Equally crucial is the need to nurture a strong talent pipeline for the insurance industry. Establishing government-backed educational institutes and skill development centers will empower young professionals, ensuring insurance reaches the grassroots and secures every Indian’s future. Additionally, granting a GST waiver on retail life insurance and offering greater tax incentives for corporates providing group life and health policies will be transformative. These measures will accelerate the ‘Insurance for All by 2047’ vision, paving the way for a more resilient and financially inclusive India. We look forward to a budget that prioritizes these reforms and propels the industry to unprecedented heights.” WhatsApp Image 2025-01-23 at 15.05.07.jpeg WhatsApp Image 2025-01-23 at 15.03.42.jpeg Stocks advanced on BSE at 3 pm on January 23, 2025, were 2,135 against 1,763 stocks that declined, and 133 remained unchanged.

India ranks #1 in the number of crypto holders and #3 in tech unicorns globally. Yet, we seem to have missed the Web3 tsunami, which doubled its market cap in 2024 and saw DeFi TVL surge by 2000% year-on-year. Ambiguity in crypto compliance and a regressive tax regime have hindered innovation, pushing startups and talent overseas. The RBI’s stance reflects a lack of understanding of decentralization’s intrinsic nature—it cannot be banned, only regulated. Meanwhile, nations like the U.S., Singapore, Russia, South Korea, and the UAE are embracing progressive policies to foster crypto innovation. The approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. in 2024 underlines the importance of forward-looking regulations. In a country with thousands of tech startups, a thriving ecosystem, and globally leading talent, the crypto industry expects balanced taxation, clear compliance frameworks, and innovation-friendly policies. These are crucial to ensuring India remains in the forefront. The finance ministry and the RBI must mitigate risks without stifling growth. A progressive approach will unlock massive economic potential, create jobs, and solidify India’s position as a global leader in Web3 innovation Fitch Ratings believes increasing stress in Indian banks’ unsecured retail loan portfolios could pose risks to our projections for the sector’s asset quality in 2025.

Sameer Bansal, MD & CEO, PNB MetLife While India is a fast-growing economy fueled by its rising middle-class population of [25-45] year olds, the proportion of people above the age of 60 is equally increasing at a rapid pace. Financial stability is a cornerstone of a secure future. One of our hopes for the upcoming budget is to see support for pension and annuity plans which are key financial instruments for the retirement planning needed to create that stability. Tax support for pension plans offered by life insurers, on par with the National Pension Scheme, will provide both greater choice and allow diversification of assets into multiple pension plans. At the same time, while we recognize and applaud the ongoing deliberations on removing GST on term life and health policies, we urge the government to also consider removing GST on premiums for annuity plans to support pensioners and make annuities more affordable and accessible. These actions would give people greater flexibility to create and protect financial stability, which in turn is an important building block for the continuing economic growth of our country.

US$ has appreciated against all currencies sharply. With new President in the US promising further protectionism, every economy in the world needs to focus on its strong points and look more internal. Fiscal discipline along with other macro parameters would be critical in these times. India has done very well over the past few years on improving fiscal health and the government has articulated its target to achieve below 4.5% deficit for FY26E. Additionally, Finance Minister articulated the target to reduce debt to GDP sharply beyond FY27. It would be prudent to continue to walk the path of fiscal consolidation and reduce debt to GDP ratios for the country which will go a long way in sustaining growth in the long term.

Paras Defence and Space Technologies Limited had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Maharashtra, India, for the proposed Optics Park Project in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra.

The forthcoming union budget is poised to chart the course for the new Indian government’s economic growth agenda. On the back of the political stability and resilient economy, it is expected to provide relief to various sections of the society and benefits for various sectors. The budget 2025 has the opportunity to help provide the NBFC sector and retail investors with the much needed impetus. Below are a few recommendations where government support will go a long way in providing last-mile credit. Wishlist as a gold loan NBFC As a prominent player in this sector, we would like to continue to advocate to provide cushion and offer maximum benefit to customers by urging the government to grant eligible gold loan NBFCs with ‘priority sector status’. We believe that providing priority sector status to eligible gold loans NBFCs will be a step forward in driving financial inclusion as it majorly impacts the small borrowers whose borrowing needs are frequently less than Rs 50,000. We also propose for a ‘Gold linked credit line via UPI’ that can go a long way in helping households/small business owners meet their financing needs and monetise idle gold jewellery. Once the NBFCs are allowed to link with the UPI payment system, this will act as a secured credit that would be extended by NBFCs at a lower interest rate (12%-18%) compared to the high interest rates (around 36%) charged by credit cards. We further seek a level playing field by bridging the disparity and aligning the single counterparty exposure limits for gold loan NBFCs in comparison with other NBFCs i.e. 20% of Tier-1 capital. This restriction impacts the ability to lend credit and negatively impacts our potential customers. Wishlist for our retail NCD investors With the growing impetus on diversifying the funding mix of NBFCs, we would urge the regulators and government to simplify the taxation compliance on the TDS on listed NCDs which is currently at 10% TDS. The selling and re-selling of listed NCDs through stock exchanges ends up putting a taxation burden on the end investor. Since the TDS were introduced on listed securities keeping in mind that the customers are not paying the tax, however on ground there is an adequate trail of holders and interest payments. Our other recommendation is for allowing additional interest rate on Public Issue of Secured Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) issued to retail investors, pensioners and senior citizens over and above the interest rate applicable to institutional investors. We believe these regulations are crucial in order to attract more retail investors and ensure fair compensations to all our investors and stakeholders.

After a negative opening, Nifty can find support at 23,050 followed by 22,950 and 22,800. On the higher side, 23,250 can be an immediate resistance, followed by 23,350 and 23,500. The charts of Bank Nifty indicate that it may get support at 48,500 followed by 48,200 and 47,800. If the index advances further, 48,900 would be the initial key resistance, followed by 49,200 and 49,500. The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended their selling on the 14th day as they offloaded equities worth Rs 4,026 crore on January 22, on the other hand, domestic institutional investors bought equities worth Rs 3,500 crore on the same day. INDIAVIX was negative Yesterday down by 1.66% and is currently trading at 16.7725. Yesterday, the Indian markets experienced a highly volatile session. Selling pressure from higher levels dragged the Nifty index near the previous day’s low. However, buying activity from lower levels in the later session helped the market recover, leading to a close around the 23,150 mark. Global markets traded on a positive note, but Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remained net sellers, raising concerns about the sustainability of the upward momentum. On the downside, the Nifty could test 22,800, followed by 22,500 levels, as the index continues to face selling pressure from higher levels. A breach below the 23,000 mark would be concerning. On the upside, immediate resistance is seen at 23,300, with the 23,500 level acting as a significant hurdle. Given the prevailing volatility, traders are advised to exercise caution, implement strict stop-loss strategies, and avoid carrying long positions overnight unless the Nifty index trades above the 23,500 mark to manage risk effectively. Hardik Matalia Derivative Analyst Yesterday, the Nifty tumbled below the 23,000 mark, while sectoral indices like Realty dropped 4.05%, and broader markets also saw losses. The India VIX surged 3.56%, and USD/INR remained firm at 86.57. Despite this, Gift Nifty is aiming for a rebound this morning, though uncertainty persists with US President Trump’s tariff threats on Canada, Mexico, and BRICS nations. Expect heightened volatility in 2025 with upcoming events like the Federal Reserve meeting, the Union Budget, and Delhi Assembly elections. Key stocks to watch today include HDFC Bank, HUL, Pidilite, BPCL, Polycab, Persistent Systems, Coforge, and Tata Communications, which are all reporting their Q3 earnings. “There are two trends in the market that deserve attention. One, the institutional activity is showing a consistent trend - sustained selling by FIIs and sustained buying by DIIs. Two, there is a trend towards quality - largecaps are resilient while the broader market is weakening. These two trends are likely to continue in the near-term. Since the dollar index and US bond yields continue to remain high FIIs are unlikely to turn buyers any time soon. This will cap a rally in the market even though the market is in an oversold zone. Largecap financials, IT and pharma can continue to support the market on declines.” Wall Street indices gained on Wednesday, driven by optimism surrounding President Donald Trump’s private-sector investment plan for AI infrastructure, which bolstered technology stocks. The S&P 500 rose by 0.61%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.30%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.28%. In the Asia-Pacific markets, stocks opened on a mixed note as investors reacted to varying regional economic data. Indian benchmark indices are expected to open slightly lower, as suggested by the GIFT Nifty trading marginally in the red, reflecting mixed global cues. On the stock-specific front, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL) announced that its board has approved the submission of a development plan for the Nunukan block’s oil and gas reserves to the Indonesian regulator, with an estimated investment of $121 million. Additionally, BPCL’s board approved the formation of a joint venture with Praj Industries Ltd. to set up Compressed Bio Gas (CBG) plants across India. After a positive start to the trading session, the benchmark index faced selling pressure within the opening minutes, resulting in a decline of 162 points during the first half. However, the index attracted modest buying interest near the support level of 22981, which helped it recover 183 points of losses and close in the upper quartile of the trading range. The area around 23060-23000 remains a pivotal support zone, and maintaining levels above it will be essential to garner bullish momentum. We open a 90D positive catalyst watch on PB Fintech. We expect the company’s new business growth to sustain in retail protection, retail health and savings business-key ingredients providing higher visibility on medium-to-long term revenue and profitability trajectory. While we do not rule out quarterly volatility in margin trajectory, annuity models’ operational performances are best viewed from incremental business flows/momentum, in our view. Management has reiterated their FY2027E PAT target of Rs10bn even considering any potential investment of up to US$100mn in proposed new venture. Effective execution of the hybrid/phy-gital strategy (~20-25% of core insurance premiums are getting converted in this model) drives constructiveness of ability to scale up life savings and high-ticket retail health businesses. Any favourable commentary from management on pickup in feet on street (# employees, indexed productivity, margin trajectory, etc.) could further revive investor sentiment. Capital Gain Tax Niranjan Govindekar, Partner, Corporate Tax, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India Budget 2024 had made big changes to the capital gains tax framework, offering both challenges and benefits for investors. Some provisions need a relook. For instance, to streamline the capital gains tax structure by aligning tax rates/ period of holding across various sub-asset classes, for instance, treating international equities the same as domestic equities, debt funds the same as gold funds, and gold funds the same as gold ETFs.The hike in short-term rates from 15% to 20% and in long-term rates from 10% to 12.5% has raised investor tax liabilities significantly. Since now the LTCG tax on securities is on par with other assets, the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) should be abolished. Budget 2024 unexpectedly removed the indexation benefit for all long-term investments in debt funds. It is expected that all investments in debt funds made up to 31 March 2023, would qualify for the indexation benefit as per earlier provisions. Tax implications on the buyback of shares - under the amended provisions, the entire consideration received is treated as dividends and taxed in the hands of the shareholders. It is recommended that the government amend the law to allow the cost of the acquisition of shares as a reduction and tax only the net amount as a dividend. Prashant Bhojwani, Partner, Corporate Tax, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India Two of the biggest asks of foreign investors in India are tax certainty and a reduced timeline for litigation. Earlier, the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) provided binding rulings that offered clarity and assurance to taxpayers and the tax department alike. This was one avenue to provide tax certainty to foreign investors. It is time to strengthen the framework of the Board for Advance Rulings and re-introduce the binding nature to provide much-needed certainty from a tax perspective to foreign investors. Currently, the maximum appeals are pending at the Commissioner (Appeals), the first appellate authority, with approximately 5.49 lakh appeals pending on April 1, 2024 (out of which 3.01 lakh appeals were filed before April 1, 2022) which does not read very well on India’s scorecard. The number of Commissioner (Appeals) needs to be increased to adjudicate pending appeals in an accelerated manner.

Title: Microsoft Eases Control on OpenAI in $500B Venture

Time Published: 2025-01-23T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
In a significant development within the tech industry, Microsoft (MSFT) announced on Tuesday that it has revised key terms of its longstanding partnership with OpenAI. This change comes in the wake of OpenAI's announcement of a joint venture with Oracle (ORCL) and Japan's SoftBank Group aimed at establishing a groundbreaking $500 billion network of AI data centers in the United States. The partnership dubbed the "Stargate" initiative, is designed to bolster the U.S.'s position in the global AI race, particularly against competitors like China. During a press conference at the White House, President Donald Trump unveiled the Stargate project, emphasizing its importance for national competitiveness. The initiative aims to leverage advanced chips from Nvidia (NVDA) to enhance AI capabilities across various sectors. As part of this venture, OpenAI will have an equity stake and operational control, with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son appointed as chairman of the board. Historically, Microsoft has held exclusive rights to provide cloud computing infrastructure for OpenAI since 2019. However, the new agreement allows OpenAI to explore additional capacity options, primarily for research and model training. This shift opens the door for OpenAI to collaborate with Oracle and potentially other cloud service providers. Despite these changes, Microsoft reassured stakeholders that its core partnership with OpenAI remains intact. The tech giant retains exclusive rights to offer OpenAI's API—an essential revenue source for the company—ensuring that Oracle will not host this critical service. In a blog post, Microsoft stated that "the key elements of our partnership remain in place for the duration of our contract through 2030," including access to OpenAI's intellectual property and ongoing revenue-sharing arrangements. Microsoft also highlighted a recent commitment from OpenAI to utilize its Azure cloud services extensively, further solidifying their collaborative efforts. This commitment underscores Microsoft's role as a significant investor and partner in advancing OpenAI's technology. As the landscape of AI development evolves, this partnership adjustment signals a strategic pivot for both Microsoft and OpenAI. The Stargate project represents one of the largest investments in AI infrastructure to date, with initial funding of $100 billion set to expand over four years. This ambitious plan aims not only to enhance AI capabilities but also to create jobs and foster innovation within the U.S. The collaboration between Microsoft, Oracle, and other technology partners like Nvidia and Arm will be crucial in building out this infrastructure. As noted by Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison during the announcement, construction is already underway in Texas, with plans for multiple data centers designed to support expansive AI operations. This evolving landscape presents an exciting opportunity for innovation in artificial intelligence. The collaboration between major players like Microsoft and OpenAI illustrates a commitment to advancing technology while navigating competitive pressures. As these companies work together to build robust AI infrastructure, it will be interesting to see how they balance exclusivity agreements with collaborative efforts that benefit the broader tech ecosystem. As we witness these transformative partnerships unfold, it is essential for stakeholders—be they investors, developers, or consumers—to stay informed about how these changes will impact technological advancements and market dynamics in the coming years. The future of AI is not just about competition; it's about collaboration that drives progress and innovation forward. ©2025 C# Corner. All contents are copyright of their authors.
