President Donald Trump worked at warp speed to “Make America Great Again” in his first year back in office, and the results, on countless fronts, have been bountiful. Trump inherited from former President Joe Biden a country reeling from a wounded economy and porous border policies that led to mass illegal immigration and a globe facing destabilization with the advent of two major wars in the Middle East and Europe under his predecessor. On day one of his administration, January 20, 2025, Trump began to take sweeping action to address issues inherited from the Biden administration with 26 executive orders — a harbinger of the breakneck speed at which he would work to implement the MAGA agenda. In total, the Federal Register shows he signed 228 executive orders throughout the first full year of his second term — and that is without mentioning the transformative legislation he signed into law and highly successful foreign policy initiatives he embarked upon. “President Trump accomplished more in one year than many presidents did in eight. The President delivered on every major campaign promise — securing the border, stopping Biden’s inflation crisis, signing the largest middle-class tax cuts in history, ending woke DEI nonsense, and restoring American strength on the world stage,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Breitbart News on Monday. “Under President Trump’s leadership, America is safer, stronger, and more prosperous than ever before, and the best is yet to come.” Trump implemented his wildly successful tariff policies that produced many positive outcomes without spiking inflation, defying critics who claimed it would, began to heal the American economy, secured the southern border, settled or de-escalated numerous conflicts around the globe through his “peace through strength” foreign policy agenda, secured significant tax relief for Americans through his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, protected America’s youth and women from radical leftist trans ideology, and unleashed his and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda. Trade Deals On “Liberation Day,” April 2, 2025, Trump instituted his worldwide tariff policy, giving the United States tremendous leverage to negotiate trade and pharmaceutical deals, broker peace deals, and drive monumental investment into the United States after policies of his predecessors led U.S.-based manufacturing to flee to foreign countries. In other words, Trump’s tariff strategy has driven many of his second-term accomplishments. Trump came out with forceful reciprocal tariffs, including a 20 percent duty on goods from the European Union (EU), a ten percent tariff on the United Kingdom, a 24 percent rate on Japanese goods, a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam, a 32 percent tariff on Taiwan, and lofty duties on scores of other countries across the planet. The results on the trade deal front in the months that followed were profound, headlined by the historic deal he reached with the EU on July 27. During a joint press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at Trump Turnberry in Scotland, the leaders announced the contours of the deal, which include the EU’s commitment to purchase $750 billion in American energy and to invest $600 billion in America on top of existing investments. Moreover, the EU agreed to pay a 15 percent tariff on goods from Europe to gain access to American markets, and Trump noted that European countries were opening their markets to American goods. Von der Leyen stressed that the deal was about rebalancing the EU’s trade surplus with the United States when asked about the concessions the U.S. would make. “The starting point was an imbalance, a surplus on our side and a deficit on the U.S. side, and we wanted to rebalance the trade relation, and we wanted to do it in a way that trade goes on between the two of us across the Atlantic, because the two biggest economies should have a good trade flow between us,” she said. “I think we hit exactly the point we wanted to find: Rebalance, but enable trade on both sides, which means good jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, means prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, and that was important for us,” she added. Trump called the agreement “the biggest deal ever made.” In 2024 alone, the countries swapped €1.68 trillion, or roughly $1.8 trillion, in goods and services, accounting for nearly 30 percent of global trade and 43 percent of global gross domestic product. The EU deal marks the centerpiece of Trump’s trade progress as a result of tariffs, and followed deals with the United Kingdom, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The trade bloc of these countries alone accounted for 57 percent of global GDP and 40 percent of international trade. Trump has also struck new trade agreements with Malaysia and Cambodia, finalized during his October Southeast Asia trip. Most-Favored-Nations Deals Trump’s tariffs are paying dividends for Americans through the Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) deals he has struck with leading pharmaceutical companies, which have drastically reduced drug prices. Trump told Breitbart News outside of Air Force One on August 3 — more than a month before he announced his first deal — that there would be “tremendous” drops in drug prices when asked if he had advice for Republicans ahead of midterm elections in 2026. “We’ll be dropping drug prices. It’ll start over the next two to three months, by 1,200, 1,300, and even 1,400 percent and 500 percent, but not just 50 percent or 25 percent, which normally would be a lot because the rest of the world pays much less for the identical drug,” he continued. “And we’re going to be paying the same thing. We’re going to have a Favored Nations. We will pay as low as the lowest nation in the world.” On September 30, he announced his first agreement with Pfizer, followed by deals with Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, EMD Serono, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi through the end of the year. Trump’s deals are bringing prices down dramatically on a plethora of drugs, and his agreements with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly provide prime examples. Novo Nordisk-produced Ozempic and Wegovy are dropping to $350 per month in the United States, down from $1,000 and $1,350, respectively, while Eli Lilly-made GLP-1 drug Zepbound is falling to $346 per month from $1,086. Trump is now calling on Congress to codify the MFN deals in the “Great Healthcare Plan.” He told Breitbart News on Friday that he gave countries an ultimatum: either agree to MFN prices for America or face tariffs. “We’re doing that by most-favored nations and other nations, whoever pays the lowest in the world, that’s what we’re going to pay. Right now, we’re paying sometimes ten times higher than other nations. So, we have favored nations, that’s been approved. Other nations have, for the most part, agreed to it, and they had no choice. Otherwise, we were going to put tariffs on them,” he said before taking off on Marine One en route to Palm Beach, Florida, for the weekend. Investments In large part thanks to Trump’s tariffs and deregulation, he has attracted massive investment into the United States from countries and companies around the world, including drug companies as part of MFN deals. Trump puts the number at $18 trillion in investment in just one year, while the White House lists $9.6 trillion in investments on its website, with some of the most consequential commitments being: “In four years of Biden, they secured less than $1 trillion of new investment in the United States … In less than one year, I have secured commitments for over $18 trillion from all over the world, the most ever for any country,” he told the Detroit Economic Club on Wednesday. Leverage for Peace The president has also wielded tariffs to secure peace agreements. He described to Fox News in October how his strategy helped yield a ceasefire or de-escalation in most of the conflicts he has settled around the world: “I think we top everybody by a lot with the tariffs and all of that. But, you know, having the ability to deal with trade, having the ability to use tariffs to help me make a point — the tariffs have brought peace to the world. I’m telling you, they brought peace to the world. And not only here, but with so many other deals. You know, I’ve made seven peace deals where countries were in many cases, 30, 31 years, 135, 137 years they’ve been fighting and millions of people being killed. And I brought peace. And I did it through — in not all cases, but probably in at least five of the seven that we’ve done so far, it was through trade. That we’re not going to deal with people that fight. We’re not going to deal, and we’re going to put tariffs on you. We’re not going to let you deal in the United States. We’ll put tariffs on you.” “And without that, without the tariffs — I mean, far more than even the money that we’re taking in, which is trillions of dollars, essentially trillions of dollars,” he continued. “Far much — more importantly, it gives you a tremendous road to peace and the saving of millions of lives, just millions and millions of lives. You look at India and Pakistan. I said, ‘Well, we’re not going to do business with either of you if you don’t — if you don’t put it together.’ These are two nuclear nations that were — seven planes were shot down as you know, and they were really at it. They were going at it, and I said, ‘We’re not going to do any business with you. We’re not going to have anything to do with you. We’re going to put massive tariffs on you, both — in both cases.’ And they said, ‘Well, we got to start talking about this. This is tremendous amounts of money and power we’re dealing with.’” Trump added, “And within 24 hours, I had a peace deal. They made — they stopped. They stopped the fighting. And we can go one after another. You’ve been really nice enough to announce all of the deals, but there have been many deals. And a lot of them — a lot of the settlements were based on trade.” Speaking at the Ford facility in Dearborn, Michigan, last Tuesday, Trump touted that his “economic boom” is underway. The data from a full year in office backs it up. The Atlanta Fed projects the Trump economy grew at 5.3 percent GDP in the fourth quarter — an extremely robust number despite likely being hindered by the 43-day Democrat government shutdown in the fall. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett predicted in November that the Democrat shutdown was costing the United States $15 billion per week and would drop fourth-quarter GDP growth by one percent to 1.5 percent. Based on Hassett’s comments, the highly impressive fourth-quarter projection would presumably be even higher if there were no shutdown. This immense growth comes on the heels of a third quarter in which GDP “rose at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted 4.3 percent annual rate,” as Breitbart News noted. The substantial GDP figures come as Trump has halted Biden-era inflation while overseeing rising wages for workers, giving Americans more buying power with their dollar. Over the last three months, core inflation registered at just 1.6 percent, the president said last week — a welcome reprieve after runaway inflation under Biden at levels unseen since the Jimmy Carter administration in the late 1970s. Per White House data, while Biden’s policies led to a 22 percent increase in car prices, a 37 percent rise in hotel rates, a 32 percent jump in airfare, and a 31 percent increase in gasoline prices, Trump, as of late December, had presided over price decreases across all such categories. Wages under Biden for the typical private-sector worker dwindled $2,919 on average, according to White House data. In contrast, wages climbed $1,048 for the typical private-sector worker in just 11 months under Trump. Blue-collar workers are seeing particularly significant boosts. Factory worker wages were up $1,300, construction worker wages climbed $1,826, and miners’ wages soared by $3,336 from January into December. “For the first time in years, wages are rising much faster than inflation,” Trump said in a December address to the nation. The stock market has repeatedly hit all-time highs under the 47th president. White House data states the S&P reached 37 record highs in 2025, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke records 18 times. On New Year’s Day, Breitbart News Texas’s Bob Price and Randy Clark exclusively reported that “the Trump administration’s border team closed out [2025] with a historically low apprehension rate of less than 109,000 illegal aliens” for the year. The figure, which includes approximately 6,400 apprehensions along the southern border in December, underscores the effectiveness of the Trump administration’s border crackdown after policies of the Biden administration, including catch-and-release, allowed for historic illegal immigration. “Once again, we have a record low number of encounters at the border and the 7th straight month of zero releases. Month after month, we are delivering results that were once thought impossible: the most secure border in history and unmatched enforcement successes,” said Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement released in early December. “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership and the dedication of DHS law enforcement, America’s borders are safer than ever before.” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Breitbart News Texas that in under one year, “President Trump has delivered some of the most historic and consequential achievements in presidential history — and this Administration is just getting started.” “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are making America safe again and putting the American people first,” McLaughlin added. “In record-time we have secured the border, taken the fight to cartels, and arrested thousands upon thousands of criminal illegal aliens.” Border crossings throughout 2025 dropped a staggering 93 percent, and 130,000 feet of temporary barriers were erected, according to the DHS, while the construction of the rest of Trump’s border wall is underway as commissioned through the One Big Beautiful Bill. The DHS removed over 622,000 illegal aliens in 2025 alone. The removals are in addition to 1.9 million illegal aliens who had self-deported as of December. Trump has settled or de-escalated eight conflicts or wars around the globe since returning to office, led by his historic Middle East peace deal to stop the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after Hamas’s brutal October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks. The president announced in a Truth Social post on October 8 that Hamas had agreed to his framework for a 20-point peace deal to end the war, including releasing all living and deceased hostages. Within days, the president jetted off to the Middle East to speak at the Knesset in Israel on October 13. Hamas released all 20 remaining living hostages on October 13. As of December 4, the remains of one deceased hostage, Ran Gvili, had not been returned, according to the American Jewish Committee. Trump, along with Arab leaders in the region, participated in a “Peace in the Middle East” signing ceremony in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, hours after he spoke at the Knesset. “So together, let us continue in the spirit of cooperation and goodwill that has finally brought us to this incredible, historic breakthrough,” Trump said at a press conference with world leaders following the signing ceremony. “If we do, together we will reach the Middle East’s incredible destiny — a safe and prosperous and beautiful crossroads of culture and commerce, faith in humanity, and geographic center,” he added. “This will be the geographic center of the world.” On December 4, Trump signed another historic peace agreement, brokered by his administration, between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda at the recently renamed Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, DC. The agreement marked the end of three decades of conflict between the two countries. “In this holy season we prepare to celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace, we have come to the U.S. Institute of Peace, to sign a historic agreement that will end one of the longest-running conflicts anywhere in the world, with far more than ten million people killed,” Trump said. “Today, we commit to stopping decades of violence and bloodshed and to begin a new era of harmony and cooperation between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda,” he added. “I want to thank the two courageous leaders. They are courageous leaders.” These are just two of many conflicts or wars Trump helped end since returning to office. He has also quelled disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, India and Pakistan, Thailand and Cambodia, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Iran and Israel. A ceasefire to end “The 12 Day War” between Israel and Iran came days after the United States carried out operation “Midnight Hammer” to neutralize Iran’s nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. Trump and his administration also halted what could have been an escalation between Serbia and Kosovo, Turkish media reported. Trump’s foreign policy footprint continued to grow to start 2026, with operation “Absolute Resolve” on January 3, in which the United States captured former Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, without a casualty of U.S. servicemembers or loss of any U.S. equipment. “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition. We don’t want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years,” Trump said in a press conference after the operation. Trump’s efforts on the foreign policy front earned him the Inaugural FIFA Peace Prize in December during the World Cup draw at the Trump-Kennedy Center. Trump shared that the peace prize is “truly one of the great honors of my life,” and “beyond awards … we saved millions and millions of lives.” During his meeting with anti-socialist Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado last week, Machado presented him with her 2025 Nobel Peace Prize “In Gratitude for [his] Extraordinary Leadership in Promoting Peace through Strength, Advancing Diplomacy, and Defending Liberty and Prosperity.” Another shining achievement of Trump’s — and hands down the biggest on the legislative front — was the passage and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. To date, the bill serves as Trump’s legacy legislation, making permanent the 2017 Trump tax cuts and implementing significant tax deductions for tipped and overtime workers, as promised in his 2024 campaign policy proposal. Waiters, bartenders, casino dealers, and other tipped workers can deduct up to $25,000 on their tipped income starting this tax season, while overtime workers can use up to a $12,500 deduction. The House Ways and Means Committee projects that Americans could get $191 billion in net new tax relief this year, with filers potentially seeing an additional $1,000 on their tax refunds coming this spring. “Millions of Americans will see the working families’ tax cuts put more money in their pockets when they file taxes this coming spring. In our tax relief bill, Republicans wasted no time and ensured that we cut taxes on income earned this year. Americans voted to have more money in their wallet, and that’s exactly what President Trump and Republicans delivered,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO) said in November. “Tax refunds are a big deal for a lot of American families. It covers home repairs, health care, or summer vacations; all of which became completely unaffordable under Joe Biden. Thanks to the working families tax cuts, more Americans will have greater financial security and ability to provide for their future,” he added. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows a maximum annual tax deduction of $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles that were assembled in the United States, as long as the filer has a modified adjusted gross income of less than $100,000 or less than $200,000 for joint filers. Beyond tax cuts, the law delivers on border security by commissioning the completion of Trump’s border wall, funding mass deportation operations, and establishing the Trump investment accounts for America’s youth, with a $1,000 seed investment from the Treasury for U.S. citizens born from 2025 to 2028. Trump has taken substantial steps throughout his second term to protect women and children from radical left-wing transgender ideology. In February 2025, he signed an executive order to protect women’s sports from male participants. “With this executive order, the war on women’s sports is over,” he said at the signing. As Breitbart News reported: The order contains several measures, the first of which is to re-write federal Title IX education rules to withhold federal funds from schools that allow transgender athletes to play as females. Another aspect of the order would charge the Department of Homeland Security with the task of denying visas to foreign trans athletes who want to enter the U.S. to compete among women. After signing the order, Trump cited the importance of female athletes and their role in the 2028 Olympics, which are scheduled for Los Angeles. He also mentioned the World Cup. “My administration will not stand by and watch men beat and batter female athletes. We’re just not going to let it happen,” the president said. Several members of the Save Women’s Sports community, including former NCAA swimming champion Riley Gaines, witnessed the signing. Just over a week after he took office in January 2025, Trump signed an executive order to ban “chemical or surgical mutilation” sex-change procedures for minors. “Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,” the order reads. The implementation of Trump and Kennedy’s MAHA agenda is well underway, with the latest moves including the new, inverted food pyramid and the return of whole and two percent milk to America’s schools. The White House unveiled reformed dietary guidelines for Americans on January 7 at a White House press briefing with Kennedy, Food and Drug Administration chief Dr. Marty Makary, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz. The guidelines promote a diet rich in protein, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy. “Today marks a decisive change in federal nutrition policy made possible by President Trump’s leadership and the work of MAHA moms and public health advocates who demanded reform,” Kennedy said. “These guidelines replace corporate-driven assumptions with common-sense goals and gold-standard scientific integrity. These new guidelines will revolutionize our nation’s food culture and make America healthy again,” he added. Makary said that “a corrupt food pyramid” had been pushed on Americans for decades, focusing on “demonizing natural, healthy saturated fats, telling you not to eat eggs and steak, and ignoring a giant blind spot: refined carbohydrates, added sugars, ultra-processed food.” He added that most children are consuming a diet including “ultra-processed food,” which he called an “epidemic.” “We have 40 percent of our kids now with a chronic disease. It is not their fault. This is something that is the result of bad advice from the government and a medical establishment that for decades peddled research from a flawed 1960s model,” Makary added. Days later, Trump signed the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act to once again make whole and two percent milk available in America’s schools, after they were virtually banned by the Obama-era Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. In early December, Trump ordered a review of the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule in concert with peer nations such as Japan, Denmark, and Germany, which recommend fewer vaccines for children than the U.S. schedule. He directed aligning the U.S. schedule with peer nations if their schedules were deemed superior in the review. While the U.S. has recommended 18 vaccines for children, Denmark recommends ten, Japan 14, and Germany 15. As HHS noted on January 5: After consulting with health ministries of peer nations, considering the assessment’s findings, and reviewing the decision memo presented by National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Food and Drug Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, and CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, Acting Director O’Neill formally accepted the recommendations and directed the CDC to move forward with implementation. … The assessment reviewed 20 peer, developed nations and found that the U.S. is a global outlier among developed nations in both the number of diseases addressed in its routine childhood vaccination schedule and the total number of recommended doses but does not have higher vaccination rates than such countries. In fact, many peer nations that recommend fewer routine vaccines achieve strong child health outcomes and maintain high vaccination rates through public trust and education rather than mandates. For example, in 2024, the U.S. recommended more childhood vaccines than any peer nation, and more than twice as many doses as some European nations. The updated schedule “Recommends all vaccines for which there is consensus among peer nations.” Trump’s bounty of accomplishments does not end there. As Leavitt noted, he has rooted out Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies from the federal government, and according to Axios, was on track to oversee “the largest one-year drop in murders the nation has ever recorded” as of late December.

Jio BlackRock Asset Management, which launched its services in May, has built an investor base of 10 lakh, with nearly 18 per cent comprising first-time mutual fund investors, its MD and CEO Sid Swaminathan said on Tuesday. The joint venture between Jio Financial Services and BlackRock has also seen strong participation from investors beyond major metros, with 40 per cent of its retail investors coming from B-30 cities, significantly higher than the industry average of 28 per cent. B-30 cities in India refer to cities beyond the top 30. Speaking to reporters here, Swaminathan attributed this deeper market penetration to its technology-led approach and sustained focus on investor education. Jio BlackRock AMC manages assets worth over ₹13,700 crore, with equities accounting for around 30 per cent of the total assets under management, while the remaining 70 per cent is invested in fixed income and cash. Looking ahead, the company plans to focus on key strategic initiatives, including the launch of Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and on offering international investment exposure through GIFT City. "We have recently received a no-objection certificate from Sebi to launch Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs), and we are very excited about this opportunity," he said. The initiative will enable Indian investors to access global allocation opportunities in a responsible manner, while also allowing international investors to tap into differentiated investment opportunities in India. Alongside this, the company is exploring the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to ensure investors have access to a comprehensive set of core investment building blocks. The year could also see the rollout of a series of mutual fund offerings. The active funds will be powered by BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) platform, the same platform underpinning its maiden active equity offering, the JioBlackRock Flexicap Fund. The first of these new launches will be the JioBlackRock Sector Rotation Fund, with its new fund offer (NFO) opening on January 27 and closing on February 9. As equity markets tend to move in cycles, impacting sectors differently, the fund is designed to dynamically rotate across sectors based on macroeconomic and market indicators, while actively managing risk amid evolving market conditions and emerging opportunities.

Crypto market crashes today: Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP prices are falling across the board as market capitalisation drops 3%. Bitcoin has slipped below $93,000, while Ethereum trades near $3,200 amid broad selling. XRP and other major tokens are also in the red. Data shows 95 of the top 100 coins declining. Bitcoin is losing its "digital gold" status to physical gold, which hit record highs of $4,725. Analysts warn that breaking the $90,000 support could trigger a deeper slide toward $75,000.

Title: Natural gas surged 17% yesterday and it’s triggering a macro trap that could suddenly tank Bitcoin prices

If the spike sticks, inflation expectations can reprice, real yields can jump, and Bitcoin’s liquidity tailwind can flip fast. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Natural gas prices surged 17.76% on Jan. 19, driven by cold forecasts across Northeast Asia and Europe, tightening liquidity in global LNG markets, and short-covering in European storage inventories sitting 15% points below the five-year average. For most crypto traders, a weather-driven commodity spike registers as irrelevant noise. Something for energy desks to manage, not Bitcoin portfolios. However, the transmission mechanism from energy shocks to Bitcoin runs through real interest rates and dollar liquidity conditions. When those channels activate, the impact can materialize faster than the market price. The question isn't whether a single-day natural gas move dictates Bitcoin's trajectory. It's whether the energy shock reprices inflation expectations, drags real yields higher, and tightens the dollar-denominated liquidity conditions that Bitcoin increasingly tracks as it integrates deeper into macro markets. The evidence suggests the infrastructure for that transmission exists, even if the magnitude and duration of today's move remain uncertain. Bitcoin’s 2026 price may turn on macro liquidity, SEC market access, ETF flows, stablecoin supply, and exchange rules. Track the chokepoint bosses, not influencers. Real yields, which are nominal Treasury yields minus inflation expectations, have emerged as one of the clearest macro drivers of Bitcoin performance. NYDIG research frames Bitcoin as a liquidity barometer with a strengthening inverse relationship to real interest rates. BlackRock has similarly highlighted real yields as a driver of crypto volatility, noting that higher real rates tend to create headwinds for digital assets by making yield-bearing alternatives more attractive and signaling tighter financial conditions. The mechanism linking natural gas to real yields runs through breakeven inflation rates, which the Federal Reserve defines as the difference between nominal 10-year Treasury yields and 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) yields. When energy prices spike persistently, they can push market-based inflation expectations higher, lifting breakevens. If breakevens rise faster than nominal yields, real yields fall, a configuration that tends to support Bitcoin. If nominal yields rise faster, or if the Federal Reserve reprices its policy path amid inflation fears, real yields climb, working as a headwind for risk assets. IMF research documents that commodity price shocks, particularly oil, can move longer-term inflation breakevens. European research ties natural gas price shocks specifically to inflation and inflation expectations, given gas's systemic role in power generation and heating across the continent. The current move differs from typical US-only weather squeezes because it's globally coupled: Asian spot LNG prices hit six-week highs on colder forecasts, while European gas inventories are roughly 52% of capacity, versus a five-year average of 67%. That tightness creates the conditions for a sustained premium rather than a transient weather-driven blip. Bitcoin stability is under threat as a diverging "protein stress ratio" reveals hidden economic risks most experts are missing. Not every energy spike reprices macro. For the natural gas move to translate into real-yield pressure and dollar liquidity shifts, three gates need to open. First, the move must persist beyond the day, changing forward curves and expectations rather than reverting as weather models adjust. The Energy Information Administration expects Henry Hub prices to ease slightly in 2026 but rise sharply in 2027 as LNG export demand growth outpaces domestic supply growth. If the market begins pricing that structural dynamic now, the spike becomes more than positioning noise. Second, inflation expectations must move meaningfully. If 5-year and 10-year breakeven rates drift higher in response to sustained energy pressure, the Fed's policy calculus shifts. Rate cuts get priced out, front-end rates reprice, and real yields climb. This is a configuration Bitcoin tends to struggle against. Third, the dollar must strengthen. Energy-driven inflation scares often support the US dollar as markets anticipate tighter monetary policy or as global risk appetite fades. A stronger dollar typically correlates with tighter financial conditions, reducing the marginal flow of deployable capital into crypto markets. Stablecoin circulation, now exceeding $310 billion, functions as a practical proxy for crypto-native liquidity. Reuters reports USDT circulation at $187 billion, reflecting institutional adoption and scale. When macro conditions tighten, consisting of real yields rising and the dollar strengthening, stablecoin supply growth tends to slow or risk appetite fades, reducing the dry powder available for Bitcoin purchases. The linkage isn't mechanical, but it's observable: Bitcoin performance correlates with periods of stablecoin expansion and loosening dollar liquidity, and underperforms when those conditions reverse. The "rates up, Bitcoin down" era is over. Here is the exact dashboard you need to trade the fallout. The clearest path to Bitcoin resilience is for the weather squeeze to fade quickly. If cold forecasts moderate, LNG demand normalizes, and the natural gas spike retraces, breakevens and real yields remain stable. In that scenario, the macro bite never happens, as this was positioning and weather, not a structural energy premium. Bitcoin's narrative remains insulated from the energy shock, and the move becomes irrelevant beyond a brief correlation blip. The more complex scenario involves the energy premium sticking. Europe and Asia remain cold, low storage keeps LNG bids elevated, and US exports remain high to meet global demand. Breakevens drift upward in response, but the critical variable becomes whether breakevens rise faster than nominal yields or whether the Fed reprices its path more aggressively. If breakevens outpace nominals, real yields fall, a configuration that can support Bitcoin by signaling looser real financial conditions. If the Fed path tightens and nominal yields rise faster, real yields climb, creating a headwind. The worst-case scenario for Bitcoin involves a broader inflation scare. Breakevens jump sharply, front-end rates reprice hawkish as markets price out cuts or price in hikes, the dollar strengthens, and risk assets wobble. That configuration matches the “Bitcoin as liquidity barometer” framing precisely: Bitcoin tends to struggle when real rates rise, and dollar liquidity tightens, as those conditions reduce speculative capital flows and increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. Bitcoin's sensitivity to real yields and dollar liquidity has intensified as institutional participation has grown and as crypto markets have become more tightly integrated with traditional macro flows. The stablecoin infrastructure that now channels hundreds of billions of dollars into crypto markets operates within dollar-denominated liquidity conditions, making crypto markets more reactive to Fed policy, real rates, and currency strength than during earlier cycles, when retail speculation dominated flows. Natural gas spiking 19% in a day doesn't guarantee Bitcoin will sell off, but it activates transmission channels that can reprice real yields and tighten liquidity. Whether those channels stay open depends on how long the energy premium persists, whether inflation expectations adjust, and how the Fed responds. For Bitcoin traders, the relevant question isn't whether natural gas matters in isolation, but whether the energy shock triggers the macro repricing that increasingly governs risk asset performance. The infrastructure for that transmission exists. The next few weeks will clarify whether it activates.

Title: Wall Street's latest gold rush has found its new target: your retirement

What do an employee at a dental imaging company, an English Premier League soccer player, and a saver with an account at BlackRock all have in common? They're all quietly connected to Wall Street's hottest investment class: private credit. The debt that most Americans have dealt with — from credit cards to mortgages — has been upfront: there are bills to pay, balances that are visible, and credit ratings that assess a borrower's creditworthiness. Private credit, or loans made to companies by private investor money gathered into a fund, is much less regulated and much more opaque. The exact terms of the loans, their price, and their ratings can be kept in the shadows and out of regulators' sight. Once a relative backwater in finance, private credit has grown into a $3 trillion industry that is increasingly intertwined with the economy. Small and midsize businesses are utilizing these loans to scale up, from manufacturing plants seeking to purchase new equipment to dental practices looking to expand. Meanwhile, private credit has become the hottest business for some of the finance industry's premier names, including Blackstone and Apollo. To proponents, like Apollo CEO Marc Rowan and Blue Owl co-CEO Mark Lipschultz, access to funding with less onerous requirements is helping American businesses thrive. To naysayers, including UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher and IMF Head Kristalina Georgieva, this explosion of less-transparent debt is unsustainable, and the dubious terms of many of these loans could lead to economic trouble. This fight has now reached a fever pitch as private credit prepares for a retail investor gold rush. There's already $80 billion in retail investor cash in private credit, but Deloitte projects that number will rise to $2.4 trillion by the start of the next decade, thanks to changing rules that will allow more everyday Americans to buy the assets. Depending on who you ask, putting private credit into regular Americans' retirement savings is the key to helping people achieve financial freedom or a recipe for disaster for the entire economy. At its most basic, private credit involves pooling money from investors to then lend to businesses. To facilitate this transaction, an investment firm launches a fund and goes around to people or groups with money — pension funds, ultrawealthy individuals, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments — and gives them a sense of what sort of loans they want to make. Once enough investors agree to pony up, the fund then goes out and finds businesses that need a loan. It could be for hiring employees, building a new factory, or acquiring a competitor. In an ideal world, the loan enables the company to expand operations and revenue and repay the loan plus interest, which ultimately benefits the private credit fund and its own investors as a profit. Companies like these loans because they can be more flexible than bank loans, come together much more quickly, and can be more personalized. Private credit firms and the investors in their funds prefer these loans because the returns are more lucrative than public bonds, with interest rates charged to borrowers 1.5 to 3% higher. The modern private credit industry dates back to Michael Milken and the junk bond boom of the 1980s, but it really took off in the wake of post-2008 financial crisis banking regulations. New laws such as Dodd-Frank prompted banks to move away from risky loans, allowing lenders that didn't operate as banks, including private credit funds, to fill the gap. The idea was that only sophisticated institutional investors or fabulously wealthy individuals who could afford to risk losses would have their money on the line. McKinsey researchers estimated that the industry grew tenfold from 2008 to 2023, while Morgan Stanley analysts estimated that the industry expanded from $2 trillion in 2020 to $3 trillion by the beginning of 2025.

As private lending expands, there's an ever-increasing need for capital to fund it — and only so many billionaires and oil-rich nations to ask for money. Kevin Desai, PWC's US and Mexico head of deals, told me that competition for investor money is "at an all-time high." The next step, both regulatorily and logistically, is to open up the funds to private wealth advisors, who can provide access to the money held by America's well-to-do dentists, doctors, small business owners, and less flashy millionaires. And from there, the final step is to get these products out to anyone with a 401(k) or IRA. Why is a fairly esoteric and risky industry looking to the general public to fund its growth, especially since it will require tangling with a thicket of new regulations? To hear the private debt lenders tell it, the move is an evangelical calling. The industry claims that access to its outsize returns will bring wealth to the masses and even help alleviate concerns about the future of retirement. Rowan, Apollo's CEO, has said that countries like Australia, Israel, and Mexico that allow private assets in retirement accounts have had "40% to 50% better outcomes." But it's not so simple. For one, the push may not be as altruistic as the industry claims. Traditional sources of capital for private credit funds are already overallocated to the industry. And while some firms can rest on their laurels, the largest are now publicly traded, which means they face shareholder pressure to continue growing. That's why many private credit funds are willing to take the regulatory and legal risks to open themselves to the average American — the numbers are simply too juicy. The country has about $12 trillion invested in its 401(k)s, and Boston Consulting Group estimates that private wealth could have a $3 trillion stake by 2030. The main roadblock has never been the law — private assets can legally be part of a retirement fund — it's the risk of a lawsuit. American retirement laws give plaintiffs a range of ways they can sue the provider of their retirement plan for not acting as a "fiduciary" or legally-responsible steward of their clients' financial future. The higher fees associated with these private asset funds create a greater opportunity for future retirees to sue their retirement provider for charging excessive fees. After Trump's election, many of the industry's bosses made it clear that they were seeking "litigation relief" to fully move into 401(k) plans. This August, Trump issued an executive order to "democratize access to alternative assets for 401(k) investors" that supported the idea of making it harder to sue, and BlackRock CFO Martin Small told a conference in December that he expects to see real changes in the first quarter of 2026 from both regulatory agencies and Congress. "I have worked in this space my whole career in asset management, and I can tell you that we have seen more progress on this topic of private markets into 401(k) basically in the last year than we've seen in the last 20 years," Small said. For years, private asset funds — both on the equity and debt side — were thought of as the ultimate "smart money." But as the private debt industry eyes your retirement account, the cracks in this mythmaking are starting to show. At the core of the concerns about private debt is the very thing that makes them special — that they're private. The deal terms are opaque, and there's substantially less information about who is lending money to whom and the financial safety of those underlying businesses. Let's say you're lending to a pipe-manufacturing company that buys all of its materials from China. If this loan were public, the impact of tariffs would be immediately reflected in its value, with the price dropping substantially in the publicly traded bond market. But in private credit, the lack of real-time pricing could mean your seemingly high-performing portfolio is actually full of lemons, and you might not know that until you get a note that one of the loans in your portfolio is defaulting. Admittedly, the regular retirement investor isn't taking full advantage of the information available on their investments as it stands. The retirement process in America, whether the underlying asset is public or private, requires trusting that your employer will act as a good steward of your money. "You're hoping that your employer picks the right managers," Alex Blostein, an analyst for Goldman Sachs who covers the large private equity and credit investors, says. The bigger concern is that the kinds of groups and industry watchdogs that do dig into these minutiae may also not have access to the information they need to properly assess risks. In the public markets, every bond offering or debt deal is closely scrutinized by huge rating agencies like Moody's and S&P, which assign publicly available grades. There are ratings in private credit deals, but not only are their ratings under the radar, but some private credit rating firms have attracted attention for the sheer number of ratings they produce per analyst. Egan Jones, which issued over 3,600 ratings on private debt deals in 2024, had only 20 analysts and a substantially higher analyst-to-rating ratio than its competitors. The eye-popping volume recently attracted the attention of the SEC, which is investigating its rating practices. Michael Dimler, a Senior Vice President of Private Corporate Credit at Morningstar, told me that when the firm reviews private credit deals, it receives the same confidential information that lenders do to generate its ratings, and there are "reliable channels of information" to keep investors in the know. In a recent paper, Morningstar DBRS explained how it uses the same policies, procedures, and methodologies for public and private credit ratings, and that the company receives information like "financial statements" and "credit agreements" to rate both public and private credit. This is particularly important for retail investors and everyday savers, as some market watchers worry that the industry will offload its worst private assets to unsophisticated retail investors. Their institutional investors and their own pocketbooks could reap a substantial payout by selling off bad assets at high prices, while retail investors will be left holding worthless assets. "A couple of bad actors could really spoil the party," Blostein says, noting that "some bad examples" could "create big reputational issues for the whole channel" even if most are "trying to do the best thing for their customers." Beyond the fundamental concerns with the private debt business, there are also growing worries that the asset class is not delivering the kind of mega-returns that justify the higher risks. As with credit ratings, actually comparing the public and private debt markets is harder than it sounds. While private credit has a strong case for outperforming its public market equivalents due to the higher interest rates, a recent study by business school academics at Johns Hopkins and UC Irvine argued that the industry's returns are "illusory" and that it fails to consistently beat the public markets. Industry executives and insiders have strongly disputed their findings, but it's a known problem that comparing the performance of different assets in the less standardized private credit market can be challenging. "The investors receive thousands of pages of PDFs, but it is very hard for them to aggregate and have an overview of what is going on and where the money goes," Oxford economist Ludovic Phallipou told the UK House of Lords last year. This presents "quite a mess," and he recommends more standardization of how information is presented. Just as owing money to someone else is a bit nerve-racking, so can relying on being paid back. This is especially true when questions about the borrower's financial stability begin to arise. Therein lies the real heartburn about private credit: What happens if the economy slows and a rash of these companies can't pay back their loans at once? Or a series of private credit funds come under stress? Goldman Sachs' Blostein tells me that private credit is unlikely to cause a market contagion. In layman's terms, you can't pull your money out of these funds whenever you feel like it, with "redemptions" usually restricted to 5% of the fund's total value per quarter. This prevents these funds from being forced to sell off their assets, which would drive down prices and cause a negative feedback loop. "The bank-run style contagion doesn't really exist here," Blostein says, explaining that it's hard to imagine funds blowing up the way, say, Silicon Valley Bank or Lehman Brothers did. Private crediteers also argue that the risk of the asset class causing issues for the financial system or the economy is overblown. For one thing, the industry is still less than a tenth of the size of the US corporate bond market, which is valued at $36 trillion. Advocates also point out that private credit funds are required to maintain a more protective cash reserve compared to the loans they make, compared to banks. While the big banks can lend out more than 10 times what they have in their coffers, the average leverage in private credit is around 1.4 times, said Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman. Responding to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's 2024 quote that "there could be hell to pay" if the private credit market starts to crack, Apollo CEO Rowan said that Dimon has it wrong. "Every dollar that moves out of the banking industry and into the investment marketplace makes the system safer and more resilient and less levered," Rowan said. But there are many other ways these funds are connected to the broader financial world. Institutional investors who provide the capital to launch private debt funds can actually borrow the money they put in, banking on high returns. Private credit funds can borrow money to make investments before investors are able to wire over their commitments or to help cash out investors earlier. These additional levels of leverage increase the potential blast zone for any private credit failures. And the source for many of these loans? Banks. So even if the mega-banks have exited the riskiest lending directly, they are still enmeshed with private investors. In a paper published earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston concluded that there is certainly risk of bank exposure to private credit, but that bank loans to the sector are largely secured and would be among the first to be repaid. This would blunt the broader financial impact of a failure in private credit, though the money would likely be lost in "severely adverse economic conditions." Michael Imerman, who co-authored the piece about private credit returns not being up to snuff, said he did "not want to cry wolf", but there's still a "non-zero" chance private credit could cause a crisis in ways that people aren't anticipating. After all, as a researcher who began studying big banks in 2007, he has seen "black swan" events before. "There's no way that all thousand loans or ten thousand loans will default at the same time. It's a consistent and reliable stream of income, let's add that to your retirement account," Immernam says, mimicking the pre-crash mentality. "What happened? They were wrong, all 10,000 loans defaulted at the same time, and retirement accounts took a giant hit." Beyond the possibility of a larger meltdown, some of the industry's biggest critics, such as Phalippou, are concerned about other issues in private credit, like stronger protections for investors. "I always thought it was quite an emergency, and now with retail in that space, I think it's a drama to not have strong investor protection," Phallipou told the UK Parliament. As for the companies being lent to, the biggest risk is that they may default. Already, some are taking on additional debt to pay off their initial loans or the interest, a process known as "extend and pretend." And if there's a wave of defaults, lenders are likely to become much more selective with who they lend to and increase what they charge to lend, making it even harder for companies to access debt without signing up for extremely unfavorable terms. "The only way to improve perception around all of these issues is more transparency," Blostein says. "And we would always argue for more clarity, more transparency, more data that will enable people to really think through all these issues." While the debate over broader risks rages on, private credit continues to grow. Even firms run by skeptics like JPMorgan are putting aside $50 billion to invest in private credit. And, soon enough, you will be part of the potential money supply. That could create a more stable private credit market, focused on consistent returns for retail customers and providing them with an opportunity to invest in the 87% of US companies with more than $100 million in revenue that are privately held. Or it could mean your retirement is going to be gambled on increasingly novel and risky credit structures that could come crashing down in the next crisis.

Business Insider is on the ground at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week, and we want to take you along with us. We'll be updating our liveblog throughout the week with breaking news, insights from interviews and conversations, power-player sightings, and color from private events. From global growth to AI, talent, and the future of work, Davos is where the year's biggest ideas are debated, deals are struck, and the road map for the year ahead gets sketched out. Follow along here for real-time updates from Davos. We're wrapping up our live coverage of the second day of Davos 2026. Today, we sampled $13 hot chocolates from Meta, witnessed an awkward moment between top tech leaders, heard about attendees getting scammed by "fake VIP passes" for the USA House, and, of course, documented some of the best fashion of the day. We'll be back on Wednesday, focusing on President Donald Trump's appearance and the ongoing fallout from his threats against Greenland. At a White House press briefing on Tuesday, President Donald Trump remained coy on the issue of Greenland, though he signaled it would be a topic of discussion at Davos. "We have a lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland. I'm leaving tonight, as you know. Davos," Trump told reporters during the nearly two-hour-long briefing. "I think things are going to work out pretty well."

"We have a lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland. I'm leaving tonight, as you know. Davos," Trump told reporters during the nearly two-hour-long briefing. "I think things are going to work out pretty well." Trump was also asked how far he was willing to go to acquire the territory, which is owned by Denmark. "You'll find out," Trump replied. Anthropic and Google DeepMind chiefs say they're seeing early signs of AI affecting junior-level hiring. Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, predicted this would be the year when AI could mean cutting back on entry-level jobs and internships. "I think there is some evidence, I can feel that ourselves," he said during a joint interview with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei at Davos on Tuesday.

"I think there is some evidence, I can feel that ourselves," he said during a joint interview with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei at Davos on Tuesday. Amodei agreed. "Now I think maybe we're starting to see just the little beginnings of it, in software and coding," he said, adding that Anthropic is thinking about how to deal with this change "in a sensible way." Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said on Tuesday that he understands why Trump wants Greenland. "I support the what: being able to project power in the Arctic," Tillis said at the "Path to Peace in Ukraine: By Might or by Accord?" panel. "Oh my goodness, anyone in NATO should understand that as a priority." Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said on Tuesday that he understands why Trump wants Greenland. "I support the what: being able to project power in the Arctic," Tillis said at the "Path to Peace in Ukraine: By Might or by Accord?" panel. "Oh my goodness, anyone in NATO should understand that as a priority." Russia and China's military drills in the Arctic show that "clearly we have to have a power projection platform and Greenland makes a lot of geographic sense," he said. But he said he doesn't agree with Trump's how. Greenland is a territory of Denmark, a NATO ally, and the US already has a military base on it. Tillis pointed out that, at the peak of US cooperation, the US had 17 military facilities there. He also rejected the idea that projecting US power from Greenland requires some financial transaction. He said that path doesn't even appeal to him as a fiscal conservative. "I think over time, hopefully we will get to the president to recognize that and have the policy that's commensurate with that," he said. A blue-and-white Boeing C-32A departed Joint Base Andrews a few hours ago and is now approaching Europe. Its call sign, SAM696, suggests it's carrying a high-ranking official but not the president. Another US government airplane landed in Switzerland at 6:40 a.m. CET, before Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared in Davos. Argentina's President Javier Milei appeared to arrive in Zurich at 3:13 p.m. CET. His government's Boeing 757 jet, registered as "ARG-01," briefly stopped in the Canary Islands, per ADS-B Exchange data.

French President Emmanuel Macron was onstage today, after two state-owned Dassault private jets arrived from an air base near Paris around 9:30 a.m. CET. We've also seen airplanes owned by the governments or militaries of Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Czechia, Egypt, Israel, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Poland, and Sweden. President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak tomorrow. Microsoft President Brad Smith said at a panel on AI and geopolitics that local resistance to data centers is the "big issues" for tech companies investing in AI right now. Smith listed a variety of concerns that people who live near data centers are raising, including whether electricity prices will rise, whether water pressure in their homes will be impacted by the centers' water use, and who will benefit most from new jobs.

Smith listed a variety of concerns that people who live near data centers are raising, including whether electricity prices will rise, whether water pressure in their homes will be impacted by the centers' water use, and who will benefit most from new jobs. "Those are completely legitimate questions, and I think it's incumbent on all of us in the industry in the United States to address them head-on and offer the kinds of assurances that people need," Smith said. Smith's comments come one week after Microsoft detailed a plan for "community-first AI infrastructure" that includes paying higher rates for the electricity their facilities consume. That followed a post from President Donald Trump calling on tech companies to "pay their own way" for data centers. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on Tuesday again called out tech companies for abusing Section 230, this time with Google's president sitting just feet away. "The social media companies have not been held responsible for the damage they did," Benioff said at a World Economic Forum panel. The Salesforce CEO owns Time Magazine, which he said is responsible for what it publishes. "These tech companies are not," he said.

The Salesforce CEO owns Time Magazine, which he said is responsible for what it publishes. "These tech companies are not," he said. Benioff also criticized Character.AI after watching a "60 Minutes" documentary about the company's impact on children. It was "maybe the darkest thing I've ever seen with technology," Benioff said. He made similar statements about Section 230 and Character.AI earlier this month. Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat sat two seats down from Benioff on the panel. Her company runs one of the social media sites, YouTube, that benefits from Section 230. Google also paid $2.5 billion to license Character.AI's technology and hire its key talent in 2024. The panel's moderator said that Porat had a "right to reply." Porat said there were areas where regulation was needed, but the upside was significant. As a cancer survivor, Porat highlighted the potential to democratize early detection in oncology through AI. "I don't want to give up on those kinds of things," she said. Benioff responded, saying we can learn from what happened with social media. He referenced some governments banning social media for people under certain ages. "That's a big step," Benioff said. "That wasn't true 10 years ago." The biggest theme emerging from my conversations so far this week is that AI hasn't delivered the tangible productivity gains executives expected. The question everyone's trying to answer is: How do we fix that? One approach is an "AI or else" approach, shoving it down employees' throats (e.g., incorporating AI use in performance reviews). But at a Business Insider roundtable I moderated this morning, the chief people officers at many of the world's largest companies advised a gentler approach.

But at a Business Insider roundtable I moderated this morning, the chief people officers at many of the world's largest companies advised a gentler approach. Cisco, for example, found that when it mandated AI training, it not only failed to drive adoption but actually had a negative impact. What was more successful was "providing choice," said Francine Katsoudas, the chief people, policy, and purpose officer at Cisco — like when it gave its engineers access to half a dozen AI tools, so they themselves could decide which tools to use and how to use them. "I do believe that we have to work really, really hard to make AI a team sport." One of the most fun parts about being at Davos is walking along the main promenade to people-watch and try the free snacks and drinks that companies and foreign governments hand out. Since this is a snowy mountain town, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are popular. One of the most fun parts about being at Davos is walking along the main promenade to people-watch and try the free snacks and drinks that companies and foreign governments hand out. Since this is a snowy mountain town, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are popular. One of the tastiest items I've had is the orange hot chocolate at Meta's house. To order, I had to scan a QR code, which took me to Meta-owned WhatsApp, where a disclaimer popped up. "Meta shares your commitment to the highest standards of ethical conduct and transparency," it said. "This hospitality is valued at USD $13." Luckily, our Business Insider policies allow me to accept free hot chocolate, and a minute later, a friendly barista served up the drink, topped with whipped cream, a marshmallow, and a wafer with the Meta logo. It was piping hot, not too sweet, and delicious. A recent warning out of Davos highlights that even the world's business elite can fall prey to online scams. Fake VIP passes for the USA House — America's privately funded celebration site at the World Economic Forum's event in Davos, Switzerland — have hit the market. In a statement on its website, the USA House warned those attending not to be duped. "We will not give access to people who purchased such packages," the statement reads. "Our sympathies to those who fell victim to these scams."

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick doesn't want to talk about Greenland, as President Donald Trump's statements about the autonomous Danish territory roil global markets. "No, it's not necessary," Lutnick told panel host Adam Tooze, an economic historian, when Tooze tried to steer the conversation back to the topic looming over Davos. "I think America and the Western Hemisphere are vital to America, and I'm going to leave that to my national security people to address." Top economic officials in the UK and Canada, who joined Lutnick on the panel, sprinkled in reminders in their remarks that the White House should not forget its allies, though they offered no specific condemnation of Trump's repeated suggestions that the US may try to seize Greenland. "What I urge Howard and others in the administration just to think of is just how your allies can help you achieve your objectives," Rachel Reeves, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, said. Later, during an open Q&A, Lutnick was pressed on how the US would respond if Europe imposed retaliatory tariffs should Trump follow through on his threat to impose tariffs on European countries for not supporting his views on Greenland. Lutnick said if Europe responds with tariffs of its own, the standoff will eventually end with a meeting between President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Trump, as happened previously. "If we're going to have a kerfuffle, so be it," Lutnick said. "But we know how it's going to end." Davos often attracts an older crowd, but I had lunch with two young tech founders here, one of whom is not old enough to drink in the US "This is one of the few places in the world where I can have a drink and not feel so guilty about it," said Cameron Fink, the 20-year-old Dartmouth dropout who is cofounder and CEO of Aaru, which is building AI-driven software that it says can predict future events.

"I did meet one person younger than me, but they happened to be the child of the World Economic Forum delegate, so I don't know if that counts." Fink and his 21-year-old cofounder, Ned Koh, were dressed in suits. They dressed up to try to make them look older, lest they be confused for interns. To save money, they are not staying in Davos, but 30 minutes away by train. "The Davos accommodations are like $30,000, Fink said. "That doesn't exist in our founder budget." Ned used 390,000 United Airlines miles to travel here in business class, which he said was worth it because he spent the trip networking. "If you look at the people around you and you start to look at logos on backpacks, you'll see that like half of America's biggest CEOs are sitting next to you," said Koh. Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, described the US job market in three words to a Davos audience: "K-shaped, concentrated, and choppy." Consumer spending is high among wealthier Americans, but middle- and lower-income households are struggling to find work and pay bills. It's a gap that she expects will widen, especially as healthcare and hospitality are among the only fields showing real growth.

It's a gap that she expects will widen, especially as healthcare and hospitality are among the only fields showing real growth. Besides the gloomy jobs outlook, a group of top economists and bank leaders said Tuesday that the global economy is resilient. Potential AI and credit bubbles might be a risk to markets — though data centers are still a worthy investment. "We're not in a productivity bubble," Richardson, who was one of the panelists, said. "What AI has promised, it can deliver: higher standards of living, higher growth rates." She expects the US will need more specialized blue-collar workers to build data centers and stay competitive. "It's going to take an infrastructure that is able to keep up with the development, and right now, we don't have it." Yaccarino, the former CEO of X, is participating in various panels along the promenade in her new role as CEO of eMed Population Health. Her winter white suit is from Gabriela Hearst. Trump is dominating not only conversations in Davos, but also the narrative in the markets. Stocks across the board have plunged on Tuesday morning, with investors showing their anxiety about the Greenland fight. Major indexes on both sides of the Atlantic are down sharply, having previously largely ignored Trump's threats to take over Greenland.

The weather is sunny and (relatively) warm in Davos, but there's a definite chill in the air. Maybe it's the heightened security. Maybe it's the long lines already forming. Maybe it's that there are reportedly a lot more people here than there have been in a long time. Whatever the case, everyone seems to be on edge. Multiple attendees told me they were already feeling exhausted, as if we were halfway through the week, even though we're just getting started. President Donald Trump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been a big talking point. Speculation continues to swirl about his Wednesday address.

After years of often being the butt of the joke in the corporate world, liberal arts degrees might be the new hot commodity. I've asked a lot of finance executives this week about AI's impact on the workplace. Specifically, how the tech's automation could suck up the need for junior roles. All of them stressed the importance of attracting critical, creative thinkers, since so much of the hard financial analysis can be done by the bots. That means they'd look for talent outside traditional finance tracks. Don't sweat it, Wharton folks. They're still interested in your types. Just don't be surprised if you're rubbing shoulders with an Art History major in your analyst class. Selling AI chips to China would be "like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea," according to Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who described the idea as "crazy." Speaking to Bloomberg at Davos on Tuesday, Amodei said that Trump's decision to sell Nvidia AI chips to China would be a mistake that could have major national security implications.

There were at least 157 yesterday, arriving from more than 40 different countries. The longest trip was made by one that belongs to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, according to JetSpy data. It flew for 14.5 hours from Hawaii. JetSpy also showed numerous companies' private jets arriving in the area, including those of Aramco, BlackRock, Google, and JPMorgan Chase. The most popular type was the Gulfstream G650, which typically costs over $65 million. Read full story Green "is my happy color," she said, saying bright colors help when "the world is so dark."

French President Emmanuel Macron channeled his inner "Top Gun" during a panel discussion with WEF cochair Larry Fink, sporting a pair of aviator sunglasses. In a special address, Macron criticized Trump's tariffs, calling them "fundamentally unacceptable." "Competition from the United States of America through trade agreements that undermine our export interests, demand maximum concessions, and openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe, combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable, even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty," he said. While it isn't clear exactly why Macron sported sunglasses, he appeared in public last week with a swollen, red right eye, opening a speech at a French military base by saying: "Please pardon the unsightly appearance of my eye." He described his issue as "something completely harmless." The presence of senior figures from US politics is noticeable in Davos this year. Business Insider's Ben Bergman has spotted both Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and former House speaker and longtime Trump ally, Newt Gingrich, on the ground today. A reminder: Trump addresses Davos tomorrow at 2 p.m. local time. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said he believes people will eventually realize AI may demand "macroeconomic intervention." "If we look at just the disparities in wealth that we have now, if we look at it as a fraction of GDP, I believe we've kind of exceeded the Gilded Age already, and this is mostly without AI," he said.

"If we look at just the disparities in wealth that we have now, if we look at it as a fraction of GDP, I believe we've kind of exceeded the Gilded Age already, and this is mostly without AI," he said. However, asked about the California wealth tax, Amodei said the proposal was "poorly designed" and called for more "sober" thinking about tech's economic impact. Private jets belonging to Bill Gates and Michael Dell touched down at Zurich Airport around lunchtime, according to data from JetSpy. Gates' Gulfstream G650 came from Madrid, about two hours away. It was on the ground in the Spanish capital for 24 hours after arriving from California. The Microsoft cofounder is scheduled to speak about healthcare tomorrow.

A Gulfstream G700, which JetSpy lists as belonging to Dell, flew from Farnborough, near London. It had traversed the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, kicked off the World Economic Forum on Tuesday with a critique of capitalism. More wealth has been created since the fall of the Berlin Wall than at any other time in human history, but it has not translated into shared prosperity, said Fink, who was appointed as interim cochair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab. "In advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain," he said.

As traffic jams snarl the streets of Davos, conversations about the autonomous future of cars are getting a lot of airtime. Earlier, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was asked about the investment landscape around robotaxis, and said he doesn't think the investment market in autonomous vehicles is overheated.

Earlier, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was asked about the investment landscape around robotaxis, and said he doesn't think the investment market in autonomous vehicles is overheated. However, he says the broader AI market — foundation models, hardware, semiconductors — has "heated up significantly," with "very aggressive assumptions of forward growth." Asked if Uber might invest in Waymo, Khosrowshahi said "no comment." "They have plenty of money," he said. "But we're investing across the ecosystem, and we're very bullish." Editor's note: This post has been updated to more accurately reflect Khosrowshahi's comments. With schedules full of back-to-back meetings and most shops on the promenade taken over by businesses, eating during the day can be tough. Some businesses set up grab-and-go food and drink stations. That's what Pinterest did, and this morning, sweet croissants were on the menu.

I opted for the chocolate crush, but I was told the cinnamon apple glow was the most popular choice, with only two left when I got there a little after 11 a.m. And yes, it tasted as good as it looked. So when the CEO of Philip Morris International US travels, even for long trips, she takes a carry-on. Her trick: Pick a color for the week and coordinate outfits around that, with travel-well fabrics. For Davos this week, the color is black. Stephen Ehikian is CEO of C3 AI, but he's no stranger to the Trump administration. Ehikian, who was also previously a VP of product at Salesforce, served for eight months as the Acting Administrator of the General Services Administration before taking on the CEO role last September.

Ehikian, who was also previously a VP of product at Salesforce, served for eight months as the Acting Administrator of the General Services Administration before taking on the CEO role last September. I asked him about President Donald Trump's upcoming speech. He had this to say: "I'm hoping there's an expression of strength in numbers, and we're better together kind of story. Now, that said, I believe this idea that taking a strong 'America First' approach is good for this country. "I think it's setting a tone and a change of direction from where we've been the last 50 years. So, I think it's refreshing. I don't even want to anticipate what's going to happen tomorrow because I have no idea." Speaking earlier this morning, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he is skeptical about some companies claiming rapid AI transformation, and that getting it right comes down to culture. Uber tried building customer service AI that followed its old policies, Khosrowshahi told the audience at Davos, but it was only "OK."

Uber tried building customer service AI that followed its old policies, Khosrowshahi told the audience at Davos, but it was only "OK." That changed after the developers started from scratch with AI in mind. Companies are essentially rule systems, he said. "To some extent, you've got to break down those rules and start over with AI in order to get the full potential of AI inside your company." Editor's note: This post has been updated to more accurately reflect Khosrowshahi's comments. Davos attracts a real cross-section of the world's rich and powerful, ranging from investors and politicians to sporting legends. Soccer great and longtime UNICEF ambassador David Beckham was spotted recording a podcast this morning. At last year's Davos, Beckham was awarded the Crystal Award, which recognized his contributions to "advocating for children's rights, education and well-being." Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who spoke in a morning panel led by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, shared how he has always prepared for Davos meetings — and how that's changed with AI. He said his field team used to prep him for 50 or so meetings, according to a "particular workflow."

He said his field team used to prep him for 50 or so meetings, according to a "particular workflow." "Nothing had really changed since I joined in '92 to essentially even a few years back," he said about the year he joined the tech giant as an engineer. "Whereas now, I just go to Copilot and say, "Hey, I'm meeting Larry. Please give me a brief." He added that the briefs generated by Microsoft's AI assistant give him a comprehensive overview of the relationship between his firm and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's team. AI tools are also changing the traditional bottom-to-top flow of information, he said. "In fact, what I do is I take that and immediately share that back with all my colleagues across all the functions," he said. "Think about it. It's a complete inversion of how information is flowing in the organization." Robot drivers will ultimately outperform humans on safety, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Tuesday in Davos. "If you think about the world 20 years from now, your Uber is going to be driven largely not by a human being, but by a robot driver — a piece of software on top of a car," Khosrowshahi said, adding that vehicles are becoming increasingly sophisticated and more like "computers on wheels."

Khosrowshahi said autonomous systems have clear advantages over human drivers. "There's no doubt in my mind that the robot driver can be safer than a human driver," he said. Robot drivers don't get tired or distracted, don't text while driving, and can operate continuously while improving over time, he added. The key question, Khosrowshahi said, is what level of safety is "enough" for robot drivers — whether matching human performance is sufficient or whether autonomous vehicles should be held to a higher standard. In the longer term, he said, human driving could resemble horseback riding today, becoming a niche activity done for enjoyment. "There's no doubt that 10 years from now, there will be questions as to whether humans are safe enough," he said. Trump is expected to arrive in Davos on Wednesday. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants business leaders to take a breath and chill out about Greenland, that may not be in the cards. Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday that he had "a very good telephone call with Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, concerning Greenland." Trump is expected to arrive in Davos on Wednesday. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants business leaders to take a breath and chill out about Greenland, that may not be in the cards. Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday that he had "a very good telephone call with Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, concerning Greenland." "I agreed to a meeting of the various parties in Davos, Switzerland. As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security," Trump wrote. Trump on Sunday had sent messages to Norway's leader, saying the US requires "Complete and Total Control of Greenland." Greenland is a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Governments keep changing their rules on EVs, says BYD executive vice president Stella Li, and that sets carmakers back. Li said in a panel at Davos that when countries go "back and forth" on their EV policy, it creates a pattern that "will confuse manufacturers." In contrast, when governments give a "very clear line," automakers can focus on execution, Li said. Read full story Bessent, speaking to the press on Tuesday morning, urged calm amid President Donald Trump's latest slate of trade tariffs on Greenland. "You say: 'If there is a protracted trade war.' Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case? Calm down the hysteria, take a deep breath, this is where we were last year," Bessentt said. "I'm sure you would have asked me the same question if we were here on April 2nd. And you know what? It all worked out."

"I'm sure you would have asked me the same question if we were here on April 2nd. And you know what? It all worked out." When asked about what European business leaders should do, Bessent's take was to "sit back" and "relax." "What I am urging everyone here to do is sit back, take a deep breath, and let things play out," Bessent said. "I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all, for national security, for the US, and for Europe," he said. Anything you do within your company's digital ecosystem is likely being tracked, from the data you touch to the software programs you use. But AI agents, not so much. That's a real concern as we rely on them more and more, Raj Sharma, EY's global managing partner of growth and innovation, told me. "We have to build industrial-level security for AI agents in that particular area," he said. "That keeps me up at night," Sharma added. For Tim Walsh, the chair and CEO of KPMG US, it's the threat of quantum computing. While still a few years out, its power is undeniable. "Quantum breaks everything," Walsh said. "I mean, all encryption." Read full story "M&A is high on the agenda," said Sharon Marcil, North America chair at BCG. "We're hearing it from so many CEOs." She pointed to a strong stock market and an overall tilt in Washington toward deregulation and robust business activity.

Similar predictions predominated this time last year. The tariff tumult put a pause on M&A early on, but then dealmaking got its mojo back. Fink took the stage at Davos to welcome more than a thousand chief executives to the World Economic Forum. In his opening remarks, he questioned whether anyone outside the room would care about this meeting of global leaders. "Because if we're being honest, for many people this meeting feels out of step with the moment: elites in an age of populism, an established institution in an era of deep institutional distrust," the BlackRock CEO said.

"And there's truth in that critique," he added. "I've believed in this forum for a long time. I certainly wouldn't be leading it if I didn't. But it's also obvious that the world now places far less trust in us to help shape what comes next." Fink said the capitalism now faces a big test: Whether it can "evolve to turn more people into owners of growth, instead of spectators watching it happen." "And that kind of change is hard. Especially in a world of competing ideologies and assumptions about how the system should work," he said. Fink's remarks ground what is expected to be a monumental week, in which deals are made and new alliances are forged amid turmoil in the wider political sphere.

Title: Macy’s cuts 1,000 jobs in Connecticut, closing fulfillment centers in strategic shift

Macy's will close two fulfillment centers in Cheshire, Connecticut, eliminating nearly 1,000 jobs by August 2026. The closures are part of a broader corporate strategy to streamline operations and centralize functions. The retailer has been a top-ten employer in Cheshire since 1986, marking a significant economic blow to the community. Local and state agencies are coordinating job fairs and transition resources for displaced workers. The move follows other recent distribution center closures as Macy's pursues a cost-saving initiative.

The move follows other recent distribution center closures as Macy's pursues a cost-saving initiative. The move follows other recent distribution center closures as Macy's pursues a cost-saving initiative. In a significant restructuring of its logistics network, the iconic American retailer Macyâs Inc. will shutter two major fulfillment centers in Cheshire, Connecticut, resulting in the permanent elimination of nearly 1,000 jobs. The phased layoffs, set to begin in March and conclude by late August 2026, deliver a severe economic blow to a community where the department store chain has been a cornerstone employer for four decades. This decision underscores the persistent pressures on traditional retail as companies aggressively streamline supply chains to improve profitability in an era dominated by e-commerce and shifting consumer habits. The scope of the Cheshire closure According to official notices filed under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the closures will affect 993 employees at facilities on Knotter Drive and West Johnson Avenue. The job cuts will occur in waves, starting with night operations and talent acquisition personnel on March 14, 2026. Subsequent rounds will impact part-time and full-time weekend and day-shift workers through the spring and summer, with a final group, including maintenance staff, ending employment on Aug. 29, 2026. A small maintenance team will remain until spring 2027 to manage the decommissioning process. Macyâs stated it will offer severance, benefits information and the possibility of transfers to other locations for affected workers. A decades-long community anchor is removed The human and economic impact extends far beyond the corporate balance sheet. Town officials expressed profound disappointment, noting Macyâs has been one of Cheshireâs top ten employers since it opened the fulfillment center in 1986. The town is collaborating with the Northwest Regional Workforce Board and the Connecticut Department of Labor to organize a job fair and provide transition resources for the displaced workforce. The ripple effect is already felt by local businesses, such as nearby restaurants and shops that have relied on Macyâs employees as regular customers for generations. Part of a broader corporate contraction The Cheshire shutdown is not an isolated event. It follows an October 2025 announcement to close a Macyâs distribution center in South Windsor, Connecticut, affecting another 150 jobs, and plans to shutter a fulfillment center in Oklahoma. The company frames these moves as essential components of its âBold New Chapterâ strategy, aimed at modernizing its supply chain, centralizing specific operations like its off-price Backstage business in Columbus, Ohio, and achieving $235 million in cost savings this year. This retrenchment mirrors a longer-term trend for the retailer, which has periodically closed underperforming stores and fulfillment centers over the past decade to adapt to declining mall traffic and intense online competition. The evolution of retail logistics The consolidation of distribution networks reflects a pivotal moment in retail history. For decades, large department stores like Macyâs operated extensive networks of regional fulfillment and distribution centers to stock physical stores efficiently. The rise of e-commerce giants, led by Amazon, revolutionized consumer expectations for delivery speed, forcing traditional retailers to overhaul their logistics models. Many are now moving toward fewer, more automated fulfillment hubs designed for direct-to-consumer shipping, often at the expense of older facilities built for a different era of retail. This transition, while a business necessity, frequently results in workforce reductions in long-established communities. Key elements of the modern retail supply chain shift include: Centralization of operations into high-tech hubs. Increased automation to handle e-commerce volume. A strategic focus on markets with the highest customer density. The closure of redundant or inefficient legacy facilities. Navigating the transition As the layoffs proceed, the focus in Connecticut turns to mitigation. The coordinated response from local and state agencies highlights the critical role of public-private partnerships in addressing large-scale job displacement. The planned job fair and access to retraining programs will be vital for workers whose skills are specialized to warehouse and logistics operations. The outcome in Cheshire will serve as a case study for how regional economies can respond to the ongoing structural changes in the retail and logistics sectors. An enduring challenge for the modern economy The closure of Macyâs Cheshire fulfillment centers is more than a corporate restructuring note; it is a localized manifestation of the relentless evolution of American retail. While Macyâs strategic pivot may bolster its financial resilience in a competitive market, it leaves a profound void in a community that relied on it for stable employment. The event underscores the enduring tension between corporate efficiency and community stability, a challenge that will continue to define the landscape of work and commerce in towns across the country as the digital transformation of the economy marches forward.

Title: Letters: The social media illusion can leave you feeling like your nice life isn’t enough

Influencers online can make you feel like your life doesn't measure up and that you are missing out. Stock image: Getty In my younger days, I aspired simply to be Liverpool FC’s Tommy Smith, crunching tackles on a wet and muddy Anfield pitch. Age soon nullified that ambition, but at least my reference points were real and achievable. Today, social media has removed those limits. TikTok and Instagram feed us a parade of influencers with designer kitchens, Mediterranean villas and endless leisure. These lifestyles feel normal and attainable, and quietly many ask: “Why isn’t my life like that?” In Ireland, with eye-watering rents, elusive mortgages and delayed independence, it is hardly surprising that a decent salary and modest flat can feel like failure. We’ve always seen aspirational images in ads or TV shows, but social media feels real – even when it represents the top few per cent of earners or carefully curated illusion. If this “financial dysmorphia” is taking hold, no amount of economic growth alone will make everyone feel successful. Perhaps the quieter remedies matter more: good public spaces, affordable transport, liveable towns and a culture that values contentment over conspicuous display. And sometimes, we might all benefit from putting the phone down and noticing the perfectly adequate lives we already lead. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Co Armagh Parents have a right to make decisions on behalf of their children concerning their moral upbringing. But what I don’t agree with is a parent’s decision to oblige their unsuspecting very young children to join a highly complex organisation like the Catholic Church. In free societies like we have here in Ireland, parents don’t oblige their children to join any political party soon after they are born. This is because, I believe, our political party leaders would then be treated for ever like dear father and mother figures and so they would very likely start to stay on running Ireland for way too long. But because children in Ireland are baptised at way too early an age, they soon learn, in an immature way, not to question how their church is run. And because of this infringement of their religious freedom, any real and practical change – sadly – happens within the Catholic Church at a much too slow and glacial pace. Sean O’Brien, Kilrush, Co Clare Eric Conway (‘Thank you, Mr Trump, for finally coming to the aid of Nigeria’s Christian people’, Irish Independent, letters, January 17) seems to be of the impression that Donald Trump was the deserved recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. In fact, Trump has further humiliated himself by parading the Nobel Peace Medal without the honour of earning or winning it. He does this while threatening to take control of Greenland, supposedly in the interest of American security, but more likely in order to enrich him and his billionaire benefactors while putting the existence of Nato in serious jeopardy. Moscow and Beijing can rejoice in the work that he is doing on their behalf as Trump is singlehandedly fracturing the alliances that have stood since the end of the Second World War. While Mr Conway wishes God’s blessing on Mr Trump, it may be of little benefit to this volatile, narcissistic character but then, God, it is said, works in strange ways. Jimmy O’Brien, Dukesmeadows, Co Kilkenny As a European country, Ireland is in a unique position. This gives the country a stronger role in the current Greenland “debate”. It’s not in Nato, so it can ignore Trump’s silly quest without breaking any arrangements. And more – why doesn’t Greenland just kick out the existing US forces from the island? Invite them back on your terms if and when they behave... In 1922 Ireland kicked out the most powerful force on the planet. I hope the current Greenland prime minister is talking with the Taoiseach on the path ahead. Gerard Walsh, Port Elgin, Ontario In the current game of high-stakes poker, Trump has the trump card. “Play ball with me on Greenland or fight Putin on your own.” Game, set and match... Pat O’Brien, Newmarket-on-Fergus, Co Clare I would imagine that Americans would say that they don’t want Venezuela, Greenland, Cuba, Mexico, etc. I feel they would far more likely be concerned with affordable healthcare and housing. They want good jobs. One wonders if the Trump administration is somewhat deaf to these needs. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary A friend who, unlike the undersigned, is a keen gardener, tells me he is delighted to see the first shoots of snowdrops in his garden. Indeed when he has also seen daffodils, butterflies and bees, he will have seen all kinds of everything. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Kerry people and many others will be delighted at the remarkable success of Jessie Buckley, the actor. Her great-grandmother, Madge Clifford, was also an exceptional person. Just one of her significant contributions was her service as confidential secretary to Austin Stack, home affairs minister, when together they administered the Republican Courts and Police in 1921-22. J Anthony Gaughan, Blackrock, Co Dublin Riddle me this: Can one soft day, followed by another cause hard rain? It’s beginning to feel like it. Ed Toal, Galway city

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Consolidation in a ‘Hunger Games scenario’ – and a true loss for the industry

Time Published: 2026-01-20T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → It’s January, and (as per…) the social feeds of most media practitioners are awash with predictions of how the industry will pan out in the coming calendar year. Many such missives are indistinguishable from the next, but among the platitudinous musings, last week’s 2026 outlook presentation from Arete Research stood out, complete with signature-style hot takes from the firm’s noted analysts Richard Kramer and Rocco Strauss. The Hunger Games First off, on a compliance note, the below does not constitute investment advice, with the whirlwind January 15 presentation exploring anomalies in the marketplace, all of which are likely to result in a Hunger Games-style scenario over the next 12 months, per the duo. All this takes place within the context of the media industry’s “Big Three” – Google, Meta, and Amazon – all of whom absorbed even more ad spend than earlier expected in 2025. “We are struggling to see from where in the economy we’re finding these incremental pools of spend,” observed Kramer, noting how this results in “Hunger Games competition.” Indeed, fellow presenter Strauss separately outlined his opinion on how the “Hunger Games scenario” will likely play out with media agencies, as holding companies “don’t have much more to give.” Of course, all this happens within the context of the AI arms race – Arete’s Kramer pointed out that the 2026 chapter of this era would see a move from “automation to action” in the rush to launch agentic offerings. He further observed the resulting “spaghetti junction of partnerships” in this rush, as demonstrated by last week’s tie-up between Apple and Google to power the latest version of Siri. “Distribution really wins in tech, and Google here seems to be in the poll position,” observed Kramer. “They have multiple billion-user properties of their own, they have captured end-point distribution with Apple… the Walled Gardens [continue to] play gatekeepers.” A ‘tale of woe’ & consolidation It won’t be news to Digiday readers that many independent ad tech companies listed on public markets had a difficult 2025, with this cohort’s talisman, The Trade Desk, seeing its stock price fall 70%. “It was a tale of woe,” observed Kramer, noting how of the near-dozen companies within this cohort, only Taboola and Zeta Global were in positive territory, with pretty much the entire category underperforming the S&P 500. It’s this downward pressure, including the need for ad tech companies to find new revenue streams and manage the risks of disruption as ad spend on the open web declines, that’s likely to lead to further consolidation within this cohort. Arete’s analyst duo noted that many developments in this sector of the ad industry will hinge on the outcome of Google’s antitrust cases. Of course, independent ad tech can’t bet its collective future on the defenestration of Google Ad Manager, as evidenced by the growth of Amazon’s demand-side platform – a dynamic likely contributing to the precipitous decline in the stock price of other DSPs – with Arete Research predicting consolidation to gather pace. “Many ad tech companies seem to be for sale right now, or looking to huddle together… this is going to accelerate in 2026,” observed Kramer, who later went on to note, “with the open web, shrinking the space for traditional SSP and DSP buying [ad space] at open web is a reducing market.” As to the potential nature of such exits? Strauss referenced speculation that Criteo may be up for sale, noting that entities such as OpenAI, PayPal, and Shopify are likely interested in assets as they seek to expand their revenue streams. Strauss again emphasized that such observations are not investment advice, although he pointed to Amazon as a blueprint for potential new market entrants. “It took Amazon a good four years to build that stuff, to hire the team, to build it, to have a proper data[set] and so on,” he added. The full presentation can be accessed via here. Elsewhere last week, the tragic death of OpenX CEO John Gentry emerged, with the breadth and depth of tributes to him serving as testament to the high regard in which he was held. Insights from the IPA Bellwether Q4 ’25: The EC further pushes to rein-in Google’s ad tech monopoly The European Commission published provisional findings on Google’s ad tech stack, ruling that its wares (primarily AdX and DoubleClick for Publishers) have been dominant for more than a decade, further recommending billions in financial penalties, with a forced divestiture also in prospect. ‘We don’t care if you don’t use our UX anymore’: Yahoo recasts its DSP as a data backbone for the agentic world Yahoo is intentionally making its demand-side platform (DSP) less sticky. “A big reason everyone wants agentic to happen is to make DSPs go away.” — One anonymous source opines on the subtext for the development of AdCP, etc. Ad tech’s Hunger Games are real… Advertising group Dentsu’s push to sell global unit close to collapse The Financial Times reports that private equity groups are turning their noses up at the international arm of the Japanese ad juggernaut. A Google VP explains why ads make sense in AI search but not Gemini — yet With Google’s Gemini surging in popularity, speculation has been bubbling in the ad industry that the app might be on the cusp of introducing ads to capitalize on the moment — and help offset the hefty AI infrastructure costs. Google’s Dany Taylor explains more to BI’s Lara O’Reilly. Google’s agentic commerce plan is here — what marketers must knowGoogle has provided a blueprint for major brands, writes Ad Age’s Asa Hiken, showing them how to connect to its AI commerce ecosystem that attempts to automate everything from shopping to pizza delivery. However, there are challenges for marketers navigating this complex landscape as Google builds its agentic framework parallel to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. McClatchy Media accuses Google in federal court of monopolizing online ad sales It’s that company again. We think you get the idea by now… Advertising is coming to ChatGPT, but not fast enough to outrun incumbent platform giants — one in particular. The European Commission is probing the industry’s response to Google’s proposed behavioral remedies. The joint venture is involved in multiple pitches for businesses with a strong U.S. base and international aspirations, while visiting pitch consultants to make sure it’s part of the consideration set.

Title: Kevin Warsh soars ahead of Kevin Hassett in Polymarket, Kalshi odds on next Fed chair after Trump signal

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/19/2026 8:02:03 PM PST by SeekAndFind Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh soared ahead of National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on prediction markets betting on the next Fed chair after President Trump on Friday hinted that Hassett might be out of the running. Trump did not reveal his final choice to replace Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, but said he would like to keep Hassett in his current role. “I see Kevin’s in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You were fantastic on television today,” the president said during remarks at the White House on Friday. “I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth.” The odds of Warsh clinching the nomination jumped to 60% on Polymarket as of Friday afternoon, while traders placed just a 17% chance that Hassett would land the job – following weeks in which markets placed better odds on Hassett. Current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who has been considered a long shot, came in at 15%. Traders saw just a 6% chance that BlackRock exec Rick Rieder could win the role. Warsh also jumped to 59% odds on Kalshi, another prediction market. Hassett and Waller got 18% and 14% odds, respectively. Trump has not set a specific date to name his pick for the next chairman. Powell’s term at the helm expires in May, though he could choose to stay on the board through 2028. He has so far declined to comment on whether he will remain a Fed governor. On Sunday, Powell publicly shared that he’s under criminal investigation for allegedly lying during congressional testimony last summer — a stunning development that came after years of Trump blasting the chair for failing to lower interest rates quickly enough.

This is from a Financial Newsletter I subscribe to: ___________________________________ As of last week, Kevin Warsh emerged as the front-runner to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve. His potential selection is a significant point of discussion for financial markets due to his unique blend of Wall Street experience and hawkish economic views. Warsh was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President George W. Bush. He was sworn in on February 24, 2006, at the age of 35, making him the youngest person ever appointed to the Board of Governors in the history of the Federal Reserve. Bush nominated him on January 27, 2006, to fill the unexpired term previously held by Ben Bernanke, who had just become Fed Chair. At the time, his appointment was controversial due to his age and perceived lack of experience compared to typical Fed governors. However, he became a central figure during the 2008 financial crisis, serving as the Fed’s primary liaison to Wall Street and a key advisor to Chairman Bernanke. While appointed by Bush, Warsh continued to serve into the Barack Obama administration before resigning in March 2011. Warsh’s experience during that 2007-2009 financial crisis provides the best clues for how he might lead the Fed in 2026. While only in his late thirties during the crisis, Warsh held an outsized influence that surpassed many of his more senior colleagues. Prior to his public service, he was an Executive Director at Morgan Stanley in Mergers and Acquisitions. Because of his background at Morgan Stanley, he was the Fed’s primary point of contact for the CEOs of the major investment banks. When the system began to “freeze,” Warsh was the person on the phone with terrified bank executives, translating the chaos of the trading floor for the academic economists at the Fed. He was a key architect in the forced takeovers and bailouts of 2008. He helped negotiate JPMorgan’s acquisition of Bear Stearns and was a central figure in the discussions surrounding the AIG bailout and the fateful decision to let Lehman Brothers fail. He spent a significant amount of time on Capitol Hill, acting as a salesman for the Fed’s emergency measures to skeptical Republican lawmakers, who were wary of government intervention. Although he initially supported the emergency measures (like cutting rates to zero), Warsh eventually became one of the first and most vocal critics of the Fed’s long-term reliance on “easy money.” In 2010, he publicly broke with Ben Bernanke in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, questioning the second round of Quantitative Easing (QE2). He worried that printing money to buy bonds would lead to long-term inflation and “market distortions.” He famously referred to Quantitative Easing as a “reverse Robin Hood” policy, arguing that it benefited wealthy asset holders (stock and real estate owners) while doing little for the average “Main Street” worker. He resigned from the Fed in 2011, seven years before his term was set to expire, largely because he disagreed with the direction of monetary policy and felt the Fed was becoming too entangled with political and fiscal goals. Historically, Warsh is known as an “inflation hawk.” He has famously stated that “inflation is a choice,” arguing that price levels are driven by the decisions of fiscal and monetary authorities rather than just external shocks. While traditionally hawkish, he recently expressed support for interest rate cuts combined with aggressive balance sheet reduction (quantitative tightening). This “rate cuts + QT” approach is seen as a pragmatic compromise that aligns with current political desires for lower rates while maintaining long-term price stability. If Warsh is confirmed as Chair in May 2026, his past suggests a strategic reset. He has recently argued that the Fed has “strayed from its remit.” He would likely prioritize shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet more aggressively than Jerome Powell has. He prefers using market signals (like bond yields and commodity prices) to guide interest rates, rather than relying solely on the Fed’s internal economic models, which he believes often fail to predict inflation. Warsh has proposed a specific strategy called “Pragmatic Monetarism” to help manage this burden. His plan focuses on a dual-track approach: shrinking the Fed’s own balance sheet to lower the cost of the debt, rather than just the debt itself. Unlike some who want to raise the inflation target to 3%, Warsh remains a staunch advocate for a strict 2% (or lower) target, viewing price stability as the “North Star” for a healthy economy. Warsh argues that for the last 15 years, the Fed has practiced “fiscal dominance” — essentially keeping interest rates artificially low to make it easier for the government to borrow trillions. He wants to end the “printing press” era. He believes that by stopping the Fed’s massive purchase of government bonds, he can force a clearer separation between the Treasury (which spends) and the Fed (which manages money). This is his most distinctive proposal. He argues that the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet is actually keeping interest rates higher than they need to be. He reasons that if the Fed aggressively sells off its assets in the form of quantitative tightening, it “quiets the printing press.” Warsh believes that a smaller, more disciplined Fed balance sheet reduces inflation expectations so effectively that the Fed can then lower interest rates for households and businesses without causing inflation to spike. Lower interest rates, in turn, reduce the interest expense the government has to pay on that $38 trillion. His current activities include serving as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is a lecturer and Dean’s Visiting Scholar, where he teaches and conducts research on economics and finance. He remains a member of the Board of Directors of UPS and Coupang. He is a partner at Duquesne Family Office LLC, working alongside billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. He is a member of the Group of Thirty (G30), an international body of leading financiers and academics, and serves on the Panel of Economic Advisers for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Based on his experience in financial crisis management, his understanding of Wall Street, his communicative skills demonstrated on Capitol Hill and his passion to reign in the $38 trillion debt and drive inflation lower, Kevin Warsh is squarely in the spotlight to be the next Fed Chair. 2 posted on 01/19/2026 8:06:09 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Just abolish the Fed and get it over with.

Current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who has been considered a long shot, came in at 15%. Traders saw just a 6% chance that BlackRock exec Rick Rieder could win the role. Warsh also jumped to 59% odds on Kalshi, another prediction market. Hassett and Waller got 18% and 14% odds, respectively. Trump has not set a specific date to name his pick for the next chairman.

This is from a Financial Newsletter I subscribe to: ___________________________________ As of last week, Kevin Warsh emerged as the front-runner to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve. His potential selection is a significant point of discussion for financial markets due to his unique blend of Wall Street experience and hawkish economic views. Warsh was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President George W. Bush. He was sworn in on February 24, 2006, at the age of 35, making him the youngest person ever appointed to the Board of Governors in the history of the Federal Reserve. Bush nominated him on January 27, 2006, to fill the unexpired term previously held by Ben Bernanke, who had just become Fed Chair. At the time, his appointment was controversial due to his age and perceived lack of experience compared to typical Fed governors. However, he became a central figure during the 2008 financial crisis, serving as the Fed’s primary liaison to Wall Street and a key advisor to Chairman Bernanke. While appointed by Bush, Warsh continued to serve into the Barack Obama administration before resigning in March 2011. Warsh’s experience during that 2007-2009 financial crisis provides the best clues for how he might lead the Fed in 2026. While only in his late thirties during the crisis, Warsh held an outsized influence that surpassed many of his more senior colleagues. Prior to his public service, he was an Executive Director at Morgan Stanley in Mergers and Acquisitions. Because of his background at Morgan Stanley, he was the Fed’s primary point of contact for the CEOs of the major investment banks. When the system began to “freeze,” Warsh was the person on the phone with terrified bank executives, translating the chaos of the trading floor for the academic economists at the Fed. He was a key architect in the forced takeovers and bailouts of 2008. He helped negotiate JPMorgan’s acquisition of Bear Stearns and was a central figure in the discussions surrounding the AIG bailout and the fateful decision to let Lehman Brothers fail. He spent a significant amount of time on Capitol Hill, acting as a salesman for the Fed’s emergency measures to skeptical Republican lawmakers, who were wary of government intervention. Although he initially supported the emergency measures (like cutting rates to zero), Warsh eventually became one of the first and most vocal critics of the Fed’s long-term reliance on “easy money.” In 2010, he publicly broke with Ben Bernanke in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, questioning the second round of Quantitative Easing (QE2). He worried that printing money to buy bonds would lead to long-term inflation and “market distortions.” He famously referred to Quantitative Easing as a “reverse Robin Hood” policy, arguing that it benefited wealthy asset holders (stock and real estate owners) while doing little for the average “Main Street” worker. He resigned from the Fed in 2011, seven years before his term was set to expire, largely because he disagreed with the direction of monetary policy and felt the Fed was becoming too entangled with political and fiscal goals. Historically, Warsh is known as an “inflation hawk.” He has famously stated that “inflation is a choice,” arguing that price levels are driven by the decisions of fiscal and monetary authorities rather than just external shocks. While traditionally hawkish, he recently expressed support for interest rate cuts combined with aggressive balance sheet reduction (quantitative tightening). This “rate cuts + QT” approach is seen as a pragmatic compromise that aligns with current political desires for lower rates while maintaining long-term price stability. If Warsh is confirmed as Chair in May 2026, his past suggests a strategic reset. He has recently argued that the Fed has “strayed from its remit.” He would likely prioritize shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet more aggressively than Jerome Powell has. He prefers using market signals (like bond yields and commodity prices) to guide interest rates, rather than relying solely on the Fed’s internal economic models, which he believes often fail to predict inflation. Warsh has proposed a specific strategy called “Pragmatic Monetarism” to help manage this burden. His plan focuses on a dual-track approach: shrinking the Fed’s own balance sheet to lower the cost of the debt, rather than just the debt itself. Unlike some who want to raise the inflation target to 3%, Warsh remains a staunch advocate for a strict 2% (or lower) target, viewing price stability as the “North Star” for a healthy economy. Warsh argues that for the last 15 years, the Fed has practiced “fiscal dominance” — essentially keeping interest rates artificially low to make it easier for the government to borrow trillions. He wants to end the “printing press” era. He believes that by stopping the Fed’s massive purchase of government bonds, he can force a clearer separation between the Treasury (which spends) and the Fed (which manages money). This is his most distinctive proposal. He argues that the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet is actually keeping interest rates higher than they need to be. He reasons that if the Fed aggressively sells off its assets in the form of quantitative tightening, it “quiets the printing press.” Warsh believes that a smaller, more disciplined Fed balance sheet reduces inflation expectations so effectively that the Fed can then lower interest rates for households and businesses without causing inflation to spike. Lower interest rates, in turn, reduce the interest expense the government has to pay on that $38 trillion. His current activities include serving as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is a lecturer and Dean’s Visiting Scholar, where he teaches and conducts research on economics and finance. He remains a member of the Board of Directors of UPS and Coupang. He is a partner at Duquesne Family Office LLC, working alongside billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. He is a member of the Group of Thirty (G30), an international body of leading financiers and academics, and serves on the Panel of Economic Advisers for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Based on his experience in financial crisis management, his understanding of Wall Street, his communicative skills demonstrated on Capitol Hill and his passion to reign in the $38 trillion debt and drive inflation lower, Kevin Warsh is squarely in the spotlight to be the next Fed Chair. 2 posted on 01/19/2026 8:06:09 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Just abolish the Fed and get it over with.

This is from a Financial Newsletter I subscribe to: ___________________________________ As of last week, Kevin Warsh emerged as the front-runner to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve. His potential selection is a significant point of discussion for financial markets due to his unique blend of Wall Street experience and hawkish economic views. Warsh was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President George W. Bush. He was sworn in on February 24, 2006, at the age of 35, making him the youngest person ever appointed to the Board of Governors in the history of the Federal Reserve. Bush nominated him on January 27, 2006, to fill the unexpired term previously held by Ben Bernanke, who had just become Fed Chair. At the time, his appointment was controversial due to his age and perceived lack of experience compared to typical Fed governors. However, he became a central figure during the 2008 financial crisis, serving as the Fed’s primary liaison to Wall Street and a key advisor to Chairman Bernanke. While appointed by Bush, Warsh continued to serve into the Barack Obama administration before resigning in March 2011. Warsh’s experience during that 2007-2009 financial crisis provides the best clues for how he might lead the Fed in 2026. While only in his late thirties during the crisis, Warsh held an outsized influence that surpassed many of his more senior colleagues. Prior to his public service, he was an Executive Director at Morgan Stanley in Mergers and Acquisitions. Because of his background at Morgan Stanley, he was the Fed’s primary point of contact for the CEOs of the major investment banks. When the system began to “freeze,” Warsh was the person on the phone with terrified bank executives, translating the chaos of the trading floor for the academic economists at the Fed. He was a key architect in the forced takeovers and bailouts of 2008. He helped negotiate JPMorgan’s acquisition of Bear Stearns and was a central figure in the discussions surrounding the AIG bailout and the fateful decision to let Lehman Brothers fail. He spent a significant amount of time on Capitol Hill, acting as a salesman for the Fed’s emergency measures to skeptical Republican lawmakers, who were wary of government intervention. Although he initially supported the emergency measures (like cutting rates to zero), Warsh eventually became one of the first and most vocal critics of the Fed’s long-term reliance on “easy money.” In 2010, he publicly broke with Ben Bernanke in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, questioning the second round of Quantitative Easing (QE2). He worried that printing money to buy bonds would lead to long-term inflation and “market distortions.” He famously referred to Quantitative Easing as a “reverse Robin Hood” policy, arguing that it benefited wealthy asset holders (stock and real estate owners) while doing little for the average “Main Street” worker. He resigned from the Fed in 2011, seven years before his term was set to expire, largely because he disagreed with the direction of monetary policy and felt the Fed was becoming too entangled with political and fiscal goals. Historically, Warsh is known as an “inflation hawk.” He has famously stated that “inflation is a choice,” arguing that price levels are driven by the decisions of fiscal and monetary authorities rather than just external shocks. While traditionally hawkish, he recently expressed support for interest rate cuts combined with aggressive balance sheet reduction (quantitative tightening). This “rate cuts + QT” approach is seen as a pragmatic compromise that aligns with current political desires for lower rates while maintaining long-term price stability. If Warsh is confirmed as Chair in May 2026, his past suggests a strategic reset. He has recently argued that the Fed has “strayed from its remit.” He would likely prioritize shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet more aggressively than Jerome Powell has. He prefers using market signals (like bond yields and commodity prices) to guide interest rates, rather than relying solely on the Fed’s internal economic models, which he believes often fail to predict inflation. Warsh has proposed a specific strategy called “Pragmatic Monetarism” to help manage this burden. His plan focuses on a dual-track approach: shrinking the Fed’s own balance sheet to lower the cost of the debt, rather than just the debt itself. Unlike some who want to raise the inflation target to 3%, Warsh remains a staunch advocate for a strict 2% (or lower) target, viewing price stability as the “North Star” for a healthy economy. Warsh argues that for the last 15 years, the Fed has practiced “fiscal dominance” — essentially keeping interest rates artificially low to make it easier for the government to borrow trillions. He wants to end the “printing press” era. He believes that by stopping the Fed’s massive purchase of government bonds, he can force a clearer separation between the Treasury (which spends) and the Fed (which manages money). This is his most distinctive proposal. He argues that the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet is actually keeping interest rates higher than they need to be. He reasons that if the Fed aggressively sells off its assets in the form of quantitative tightening, it “quiets the printing press.” Warsh believes that a smaller, more disciplined Fed balance sheet reduces inflation expectations so effectively that the Fed can then lower interest rates for households and businesses without causing inflation to spike. Lower interest rates, in turn, reduce the interest expense the government has to pay on that $38 trillion. His current activities include serving as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is a lecturer and Dean’s Visiting Scholar, where he teaches and conducts research on economics and finance. He remains a member of the Board of Directors of UPS and Coupang. He is a partner at Duquesne Family Office LLC, working alongside billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. He is a member of the Group of Thirty (G30), an international body of leading financiers and academics, and serves on the Panel of Economic Advisers for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Based on his experience in financial crisis management, his understanding of Wall Street, his communicative skills demonstrated on Capitol Hill and his passion to reign in the $38 trillion debt and drive inflation lower, Kevin Warsh is squarely in the spotlight to be the next Fed Chair. Just abolish the Fed and get it over with. Changing the chair only rearranges the deck chairs on teh Titanic.

Title: Kevin Hart’s Blacked-Out Ford Looks Straight Out of the ’70s, and Now It Can Be Yours

Learn more By: Ethan Brehm Published: Jan 19, 2026 By: Ethan Brehm Published: Jan 19, 2026 Kevin Hart’s custom 2024 Ford Bronco is headed to auction later this month, and it’s not your typical celebrity restomod. Instead of taking a classic Bronco and modernizing it, Hart did the reverse, buying a brand-new sixth-generation model and having it restyled to look like it rolled off the line in 1971. Working with builder Vintage Modern, he stripped away the modern bodywork and replaced it with custom panels that channel the first-generation Bronco. The one-of-one build goes up for sale at Barrett-Jackson’s Scottsdale auction with no reserve this week. For the exterior transformation, Hart and Vintage Modern swapped the factory panels for custom bodywork that mimics the ’60s- and ’70s-era Bronco, complete with the iconic round headlights, simple horizontal grille, narrow vertical taillights, and indelible orange side markers. Finished in Triple Black with matte accents, it’s paired with a removable soft top and BFGoodrich all-terrain rubber. Under the skin, though, it’s still very much a 2024 Bronco, featuring Ford’s 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 pushing 330hp and 415lb.ft of torque through a 10-speed automatic. Fox Factory Racing suspension and Roush intake/exhaust round out the performance upgrades. Inside, there are hand-stitched Blackrock leather covers nearly every surface, while “Vintage” script hits the console and wheel. The digital driver display and center touchscreen stay put as well, while a Kenwood audio system handles the sound. All the contemporary safety gear (anti-lock brakes, airbags, crumple zones) remains intact. Ford’s decision to bring back the Bronco in 2021 marked the end of a 25-year absence. The sixth-generation model tapped into decades of pent-up demand for a legitimate Jeep Wrangler rival, offering removable doors and roof panels alongside serious off-road hardware like the HOSS suspension system and up to 11.6″ of ground clearance. Hart’s build takes advantage of that matured platform, using the mechanical stability of a fourth-year production model as the foundation for his retro transformation. Model: 2024 Ford Bronco (Custom) Engine: 2.7L EcoBoost V6 Power: 330 hp; 415 lb-ft torque Transmission: 10-speed automatic Suspension: Fox Factory Racing Intake/Exhaust: Roush Exterior: Triple Black with matte trim Interior: Hand-stitched Blackrock leather Audio: Kenwood system Tires: BFGoodrich all-terrain Edition: One-of-one This one-off 2024 Bronco build crosses the block at Barrett-Jackson’s Scottsdale 2026 auction, running January 17-25, with no reserve. Standard high-trim Broncos can push six figures depending on spec, but Hart’s celebrity provenance and Vintage Modern’s craftsmanship will likely drive the hammer price well beyond that. Kevin Hart’s custom 2024 Ford Bronco is hitting the Barrett-Jackson auction block later this month, and it’s basically a brand-new truck that’s been restyled to look like a first-generation model from the early ’70s. Working with Vintage Modern, Hart kept all the modern performance and tech but swapped the exterior for that classic boxy look.

Title: The plunder of Venezuela is the dead end of history

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory As deplored in the Washington Post, Washington’s recent assault on Venezuela wasn’t just your usual US war of aggression/regime change operation but also served to facilitate a particular kind of insider trading. Or rather, betting: On the so-called ‘prediction’ platform Polymarket, a very well-informed investor wagered over $30,000 that Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro would be out of office by the last day of January and – lo and behold! – “walked away with more than $400,000 in profit.” That “prediction” was “timed with such pitch-perfect precision that it drew heavy media scrutiny” as it “bore the hallmarks of insider trading.” You. Don’t. Say. There’s cheating going on at the White House and among its hangers-on! Now, let’s be realistic: Real, existing capitalism – not the Friedrich von Hayek-Milton Friedman fan fiction that still dulls all too many minds – has always been ruthless. Its modern history of about half a millennium includes stupendous scientific, technological, and cultural change, as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels acknowledged in their Communist Manifesto, parts of which read almost as a panegyric to the bourgeoisie and the capitalist world it made. But that world also began with the vicious impoverishment and exploitation of the masses, the plunder and devastation of whole continents and their original inhabitants, and a brisk international slave trade, vitiating and ending millions of lives. Marxists call this “primitive accumulation”; their master also used the term “original expropriation,” sardonically comparing its role in traditional political economy to man’s fall from divine grace in Christian mythology. After the establishment of first a traditional European great power empire under a radically new management dedicated to Communism in 1917 and then, one World War later, a whole Communist “second world” – centered in but not restricted to Eurasia – the capitalist regimes of the West slowly learned to tread a little more carefully, at least at home. Treating their populations to some reformist rhetoric, very moderate redistribution and unusually rational public spending, for a short moment in history the ruling – and owning – elites of countries such a West Germany and France almost looked as if in search of capitalism-with-a-human face. Even some American presidents weren’t ashamed to promise “progressive” things such as a “new deal” (Roosevelt) and a “great society” (Johnson). After the global neoliberal and right-libertarian surge and the end of most of that rival “second world” several decades ago, capitalism has become more brutally straightforward again everywhere. And not only in terms of the frank contempt its current elites – such as the real-estate billionaire who also runs the US and the BlackRock and Rothschild careerists who are in charge of Germany and France respectively – display for everyone not part of their exclusive, disdainful club. Plunder plain and simple was never gone from the repertory of capitalism, obviously. Just ask the Syrians what has happened to their oil, for instance. More than half a decade ago, in his first term, American buccaneer-in-chief Donald Trump, already had a moment of refreshing candor, openly acknowledging that the US military was in Syria (perfectly illegally under international law, of course) “to take the oil. I took the oil. The only troops I have [in Syria] are taking the oil.” Still, what Washington’s beasts of prey are doing to Venezuela now is an especially glaring example of shamelessness, a fresh peak performance (for now) of American chutzpah. The Trumpists and their media are positively reveling in their own iniquity. The robbing of Venezuela’s resources – what is already taking place and the much bigger plunder gleefully expected for the future – is celebrated in public. And if there is dissent, then only about the profits to be had, their prospective scale and whether they are quite as certain as Trump. (Spoiler alert: not, obviously.) Take the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), for instance, one of the top party organs of the international predator class (next to the likes of The Economist, Financial Times, and Bloomberg). Between the kidnapping of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro – with the killing of over a hundred Venezuelans and Cubans, at least – and the escalating media campaign to prepare for another war of aggression against Iran, the newspaper was busy with assessing the economic impact of future US exploitation of Venezuela’s oil: in essence, will it lower the global oil price? And if so, what does that mean for other oil producers, those in OPEC, but also, crucially, in the US (complicated, actually, with many domestic American oil producers dreading a price drop), for Trump, his Republicans and their domestic standing (the midterms are threatening and affordability remains an issue), and last and probably least, for ordinary Americans? Thankfully, the WSJ has also artlessly drawn attention to a particularly cynical aspect of the Great Venezuelan Oil (and gold, and lithium, and more) Robbery. No, not the insider betting at Polymarket but what it called the “Donroe Trade,” with investors “racing to capitalize on President Trump’s ambitions to dominate the Western Hemisphere,” that is, in less ideological language, on the windfalls from imperialism. There has been a “sharp rally” in Venezuelan debt – a regime change bet already noticed last December – boosting “hedge funds and other investment firms.” And, as good investors are supposed to do, they are also already “eyeing debt in Colombia and Cuba” and preparing for opportunities in Mexico and Greenland, too. Regarding Venezuela again, one firm at least is planning exploratory trips to inspect the loot and is “keeping in touch” with the White House. Venezuelans may have mixed feelings about the same firm having a history of organizing such trips to Ukraine and Syria. And if nothing else makes money, there still is the potentially very lucrative niche of doing business with arbitration claims. In short, the vultures aren’t just circling, they are pouncing. And the good old Wall Street Journal, unsurprisingly, finds all of that quite normal and as it should be. Yet, read another flagship publication of real-existing capitalism, Bloomberg, and you’ll find news that should give Washington’s triumphant pirates of the Caribbean food for thought. Just as enough investors were swarming into the ‘Donroe Trade’ of booty, pillage, and big boisterous promises to merit a lengthy WSJ article, a different kind of boom was taking place centered on a different region of the world: Asia, including China. There, Bloomberg reported, tech and AI stocks were “on a tear.” And this was not just any surge for stocks from Asia. Rather, investors – very much including those from the US – were “betting their momentum and outperformance against US peers will last through” all of 2026. The simple fact that these hopes shape the market mood is more important than the details. Investors are optimistic about Asian semiconductor supply chains, earnings potentials, and cutting-edge technological progress, while feeling worried about American tech and AI stocks’ ability to sustain their “rally after years of outsized gains,” in short, a typical US bubble. In particular, Bloomberg notes, “enthusiasm over [China’s] tech prowess has only grown in the new year.” China – that is, the geopolitical competitor that Washington is most obsessed with, next to Russia. This is a snapshot of a telling moment in history-on-the-move, no more. But take a step back and consider this picture in the round: In Venezuela, the US has – once again – proven its supreme legal and moral nihilism, as well as its ability to brutally beat up much weaker countries. It has also made a special point of letting the world know that the scourging of Caracas is meant as a lesson to frighten Latin America in particular and all of us in general. That on its own may look like a sort of success, or as they say in Washington, “a win.” But in reality, as the American historian Alfred McCoy – certainly no friend of either Russia or China – has observed, America “is an empire in decline.” Its lashing-out and crudely undisguised, even proud pillaging fundamentally reflects weakness, not strength. In the words of Emmanuel Todd, the brilliant French intellectual who correctly predicted the fall of the Soviet Union, and more recently, the “defeat of the West,” America is no longer capable of re-industrializing. It has become too incompetent in actually producing things or training the engineers and workers that can produce those things, even if Trump’s policy of tariffs and protectionism looks as if it is about bringing manufacturing home. What this late-state US is good at is extremely uninhibited violence and “predation,” that is, plain robbery. Ironically, capitalists sense this long-term change with the same acuity they display for the fleeting opportunities to profit from the ransacking of Venezuela. Yet none of this makes a difference to the fact that Washington is losing its grip. It can still inflict great pain and cause terrible destruction, but it cannot offer a vision of international – or, for that matter, domestic – order that attracts anyone who isn’t corrupt, submissive by nature, or witless.

Title: What CFOs Need to Know About the NYSE’s Tokenization Platform

Highlights The New York Stock Exchange has announced plans to develop a regulated platform for trading and on-chain settlement of tokenized securities. Tokenized equities could cut settlement from T+2 to near-instant, reducing risk and freeing capital, but they clash with existing U.S. securities laws and custody concepts overseen by the SEC. Despite unresolved regulation and industry pushback, growing support from major institutions suggests tokenization may move from experiment to core market infrastructure, leading CFOs to balance innovation with compliance. The digital asset space first wanted to replace the financial system. Now, the blockchain ecosystem is lowering its gaze from that sky-high goal and seeking instead merely to eliminate legacy inefficiencies in payments and capital markets.

Δ And that goal got a shot in the arm on Monday (Jan. 19) with the announcement that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE), is developing a platform for the trading and on-chain settlement of tokenized securities, for which it will seek regulatory approvals. “For more than two centuries, the NYSE has transformed the way markets operate,” said Lynn Martin, president, NYSE Group, in a statement. “We are leading the industry toward fully on-chain solutions, grounded in the unmatched protections and high regulatory standards that position us to marry trust with state-of-the-art technology. Harnessing our expertise to reinvent market infrastructure is how we’ll meet and shape the demands of a digital future.” “Supporting tokenized securities is a pivotal step in ICE’s strategy to operate on-chain market infrastructure for trading, settlement, custody, and capital formation in the new era of global finance,” added Michael Blaugrund, vice president of strategic initiatives at ICE. For enterprise chief financial officers (CFOs) and treasury teams, tokenized equities represent both a strategic opportunity and a regulatory minefield. Unlike cryptocurrencies that function as native digital assets, tokenized equities are digital representations of traditional shares recorded on a blockchain, often with shareholder rights, dividends and governance linked to the underlying securities. But the broader question of how to harmonize centuries-old securities laws with decentralized technologies remains a defining, and as of yet unsolved, challenge for regulators, intermediaries and market participants alike. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue More here: Wall Street Moves On-Chain as Tokenization of US Stocks Goes Global At its essence, tokenization seeks to eliminate legacy inefficiencies in capital markets. Traditional settlement cycles, which are typically T+2 for U.S. equities, embed counterparty, operational and liquidity risks. By contrast, blockchain protocols promise near-instantaneous settlement, reducing counterparty exposure and shortening capital cycles. Tokenized equities, however, simply aren’t regulated by the U.S. At least, not yet. Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Division of Trading and Markets Staff took a consequential, if incremental, step toward clarifying how traditional market intermediaries, specifically broker-dealers, should treat crypto asset securities. In the traditional securities world of equities, corporate bond, and registered funds, physical possession has a well-established meaning: either holding certificated securities or, more commonly today, maintaining accounts at centralized clearinghouses or custodians that satisfy regulatory “good control location” criteria. With tokenized securities residing on blockchain networks, however, the concept of physical possession is less tangible. Crypto asset “ownership” is typically defined by control over cryptographic private keys, and there is no centralized registry equivalent to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) for many digital assets. This disconnect created regulatory uncertainty for broker-dealers that wish to carry tokenized securities on behalf of customers. Without clear interpretive guidance, intermediaries were left to extrapolate from existing frameworks, or to rely on outdated advisory statements that did not fully contemplate modern distributed ledger technology (DLT). PYMNTS covered Wednesday (Jan. 14) how the blockchain-based lender Figure has launched a way for companies to list their equity native on blockchain. The company claimed that its initiative differs from other tokenization efforts in that OPEN equities are blockchain registered, and not a tokenized version of DTCC securities. And we explored the tokenization topic over this past summer in an interview with Brett McLain, head of payments and blockchain at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. “The tokenization of real-world assets [has] long been a holy grail for crypto … making those real-world assets more accessible globally to consumers,” McLain said. “We want to see that grow into other things like real estate and other tangible assets.” Even BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has gone on record alleging that all assets should be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his 2025 annual shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” See also: Regulators Rewrite How Blockchain Gets Built At the same time, the elephant in the room as it relates to tokenization of equities is the fact that there exists no federal policy framework in the U.S. regulating this emerging asset class. Tokenized equities were among the key reasons why cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase withdrew its support for the Senate Banking Committee’s draft of a market structure bill for digital assets, with the company’s CEO believing that the bill’s text included a “de facto ban” on tokenized equities. But the NYSE’s own decision to move forward with its tokenized securities initiative underscores a broader transformation: tokenization may soon shift from niche experiment to systemic feature of global capital markets, if regulatory approval allows. For CFOs, success will derive from balancing innovation with governance, shaping strategic initiatives that integrate tokenized equities without compromising compliance or market integrity. Global regulatory fragmentation also poses a challenge. While U.S. regulators pursue frameworks under the SEC’s aegis, other jurisdictions may implement divergent rules from permissive regimes to outright prohibitions on token trading, potentially forcing multinationals to adopt segmented strategies tailored to each jurisdiction’s legal environment.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Netflix Stock to Move After Earnings Tuesday

Netflix is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Tuesday, with traders anticipating a big swing in the streaming giant's stock following the results. Options pricing suggests traders expect Netflix (NFLX) stock could move up to 7% in either direction by the end of the week. At the high end, a move of that size from Friday's level at $88 would push the stock up to around $94, recovering some of its recent losses. At the low end, shares could slip below $82, their lowest level in over a year. Netflix shares are down nearly 30% since the company's last quarterly report in October, when an earnings miss due to a surprise tax expense sent the shares tumbling 10% the day after the results. The shares have also been pressured over the last month by worries about the streaming giant's pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which has faced some pushback from politicians and rival bidder Paramount Skydance (PSKY). Netflix executives will likely receive a number of questions about the deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, including how the company plans to pay for the purchase amid reports that it is considering making its offer all-cash rather than a mix of cash and stock. Netflix is expected to report a nearly 17% jump in revenue to $11.97 billion, while earnings per share are expected to gain nearly 30% year-over-year to $0.55, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Goldman Sachs analysts told clients earlier this month that they expect the fourth-quarter report to "reflect a solid end to 2025 as management continues to execute well against its core areas of strategic focus," such as growing user engagement and scaling live sports and gaming offerings, along with Netflix's ad business. However, the analysts said investors' attention could be more focused on questions surrounding the Warner Bros. deal, including regulatory uncertainty, competition from Paramount, and how Netflix's business will operate until the deal potentially closes. Ahead of Tuesday's results, most Wall Street analysts are bullish on Netflix stock. Of the 10 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha, eight consider the stock a "buy," compared to two "hold" ratings. Their average price target of $135 would suggest over 50% upside from its recent level.

Title: Multiple States Follow Texas in Launching Bitcoin Reserve Initiatives
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2026/01/19/multiple-states-follow-texas-in-launching-bitcoin-reserve-initiatives/
Time Published: 2026-01-19T18:06:33Z

Texas has become the first American state to acquire bitcoin for its public treasury, setting off a nationwide competition as other states rush to establish their own cryptocurrency strategic reserves. CNBC reports that Texas has made history by becoming the first state to purchase bitcoin as part of its public investment strategy, launching what experts are calling a “Reserve Race” among states seeking to position themselves at the forefront of digital asset adoption. The move comes as numerous states across different political alignments pursue legislation to bring cryptocurrencies onto their public balance sheets. The Texas crypto purchase involved approximately five million dollars invested in the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust, one of the largest bitcoin exchange-traded funds that has accumulated over seventy-two billion dollars in assets under management since its January 2024 launch. The state comptroller’s office executed the transaction on November 20, 2025, when bitcoin was trading at approximately ninety-one thousand three hundred thirty-six dollars per coin. With bitcoin trading above ninety-five thousand dollars as of recently, the investment has already shown modest gains. This purchase represents only half of the ten million dollars Texas has allocated for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. State officials have characterized this initial ETF investment as a placeholder measure while they develop the necessary security infrastructure and storage protocols for holding actual bitcoin directly. The legislative framework for the reserve was established through a 2024 law that authorized the state comptroller to hold cryptocurrency. New Hampshire actually preceded Texas in passing crypto strategic reserve legislation, enacting its law last May. The New Hampshire law grants the state treasurer authority to invest up to five percent of state funds in cryptocurrency ETFs, though the authorization also extends to precious metals including gold. Arizona has passed similar legislation, while Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Dakota all have cryptocurrency reserve bills at various stages of committee review and legislative consideration. The trend toward state-level cryptocurrency adoption is not strictly following partisan political lines, despite much of the legislation being primarily sponsored or co-sponsored by Republican lawmakers. The cryptocurrency industry emerged as a major political force during the 2024 election cycle, becoming the largest corporate donor and providing support to candidates from both major parties. The industry is already accumulating resources for the 2026 midterm elections. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, views the state-level initiatives primarily as signaling mechanisms at this stage. According to Marlowe, governors seeking to demonstrate openness to innovative business development in the digital economy find these cryptocurrency measures to be relatively low-cost and low-risk ways to communicate that message. This explains why political leaders across the ideological spectrum and throughout different geographic regions have taken concrete steps in this direction. In states taking more substantial steps, including Texas, Arizona, and Florida, Marlowe noted that acknowledging the growing political influence of cryptocurrency advocates has played a significant role in advancing these initiatives. Common elements across state cryptocurrency initiatives include authorizing state treasurers or other investment officials to allocate limited amounts of public funds to crypto investments and establishing governance structures necessary for managing cryptocurrency holdings. These governance frameworks often involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. The funding sources for these reserves vary, with some states using cash while others utilize government-seized cryptocurrency, similar to the federal approach. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to create a strategic bitcoin reserve at the federal level, though the authorization was limited to seized cryptocurrency to demonstrate that taxpayers would bear no direct financial burden from the initiative. Texas’s emergence as the first state to fund a crypto reserve follows logically from its established position as a cryptocurrency hub, particularly in bitcoin mining operations. The state’s combination of affordable and flexible power infrastructure, along with a generally pro-cryptocurrency political environment, has positioned Texas as a significant player in both the national and global bitcoin mining market in recent years. Beyond strategic reserves, states are integrating cryptocurrency into core financial and budgeting functions. New Hampshire became the first state to approve a bitcoin-backed municipal bond issuance last November. The proposed one hundred million dollar issuance would represent the first time cryptocurrency serves as collateral in the U.S. municipal bond market. While the transaction has not yet occurred, plans call for completion this year. Read more at CNBC here.

Title: California Billionaire Tax: Why Some Billionaires Are Planning Exits

ByNathan Goldman, Contributor. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act has sent shockwaves across the U.S. This act is generally defined by its proposed one-time tax of five percent on California residents’ net worth if they have over $1 billion of wealth. There are clear theoretical arguments to be made for the bill’s passage as it would raise an estimated $100 billion for health care and educational needs. However, recent analysis suggests that design choices and the current wording of the act could have devastating legal and economic consequences, including some billionaires being taxed well beyond the proposed 5% rate. What follows summarizes the current state of the proposed California billionaire tax, the recent criticism of the act and the design choices that may need to be reconsidered before it is potentially put up to a vote. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act was filed by Jim Mangia, president and CEO of St. John’s Community Health, and Suzanne Jimenez, who represents the SEIU-UHW health care union, in October of 2025. The act has since been put forth as formal legislation on Nov. 26, 2025, under the header of Initiative No. 25-0024. The act is currently collecting signatures to appear on the November 2026 election ballot. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act enacts a 5% tax on the wealth of California residents who have accumulated over $1 billion in wealth. The tax is unusual because it is a tax on wealth, rather than income, and the tax would include payments related to unrealized gains. According to Forbes, this act would raise $100 billion from California’s 200 or more billionaires between 2027 and 2031 (assuming no taxpayer migration or successful legal challenges), and these funds would go to replenishing funding for California’s Medicaid and childhood education program. According to the bill, taxpayers’ wealth will be defined by “personal property and wealth, including shares of capital stock, bonds, or other evidences of indebtedness, and any legal or equitable interest therein.” Thus, the bill is taking the stance that all assets shall be considered when determining whether a taxpayer is a billionaire and subject to the wealth tax. The bill does allow a phase-in that will subject the taxpayer to the 5% tax fully once their wealth reaches $1.1 billion. Only a small amount of assets (up to $5 million) can be excluded from the taxpayer’s net worth when calculating their billionaire status and wealth tax liability owed. Even though the bill will not be voted on until November, the initiative proposes a retroactive effective date of Jan. 1, 2026, a feature likely to face legal challenge. As it is currently written, this retroactive application would subject California billionaires to the 5% wealth tax immediately. The proposal has already prompted significant responses among California billionaires. According to The New York Times, Peter Thiel and Larry Page have openly discussed leaving California due to this tax. Furthermore, Fox Business reports that real estate broker Julian Johnston is working directly with three billionaires about moving from California to South Florida due to this billionaire wealth tax. California already imposes the highest and most progressive income tax rate in the U.S., with a top marginal tax rate of 13.3% on income over $1 million. This billionaire wealth tax would represent an incremental tax on high-net-worth taxpayers in addition to the already high taxes that they pay, leading to possible perceived inequity over this tax. However, not all California billionaires are opposed to this plan. According to CNBC, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang has said that the additional taxes owed (a reported $7.75 billion) is “perfectly fine” with him. While this news is promising, it needs to be taken with caution for two reasons. First, even if some California billionaires pay the wealth tax, if a significant number do not and challenge paying it, California may lose out on those tax revenues both for the wealth tax and in the future. Second, just because a billionaire says they will support this does not mean that they actually will. In fact, just 2½ years ago, Jeff Bezos supported Washington’s proposed billionaire tax. According to the Tax Foundation, he then announced a move to Miami, Florida, shortly before its passage, allowing him to forgo paying any wealth tax and upending the legislation’s potential. Potentially the biggest criticism of this legislation is not from the billionaires themselves, but, instead, from the state’s current governor, Gavin Newsom. According to the Los Angeles Times, Newsom strongly opposes this ballot measure, saying that it is badly drafted and will not end up aiding the essential state services it is geared toward. Given Newsom’s prominent role in both the state and the nationwide Democratic Party, his opposition likely carries a lot of weight among potential voters this November. In theory, funding health care and education needs by asking billionaires to contribute a small percentage of their wealth may seem like a popular and plausible path toward addressing a key problem in California. However, there have already been numerous issues raised with this plan. For instance, Baker Botts highlights issues like the Dormant Commerce Clause lead to a failure of the Complete Auto Test because worldwide assets would be subject to a California tax. This article also highlights numerous legal concerns associated with the retroactive nature of the legislation, the legislation being aimed at single out specific individuals (Bill of Attainder), the Uniformity Clause of the California Constitution, among other things. The Tax Foundation highlights that, as a function of design issues and potential drafting errors, the 5% wealth tax is actually much larger than that. In particular, a billionaire’s valuation is based on voting interests. The article uses Tony Xu, the founder of DoorDash, as an example. Xu owns 2.6% of the company but controls 57.6% of the vote. In this example, Xu has a $2.41 billion net worth based on his ownership in the company. However, as a consequence of the bill as currently written, Xu’s wealth tax consequence would be $4.17 billion, or 173% of his company ownership. The Tax Foundation highlights five other California billionaires whose tax liability would be well over the 5% being advertised, including David Baszucki (Roblox), Sergey Brin (Alphabet), Larry Page (Alphabet), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), and Jensen Huang (Nvidia). This raises questions about whether affected taxpayers would remain in California due to the unusually high wealth tax rate they would be facing. Other considerations raised by the article are that the levying of the tax might force billionaires to sell a large number of their shares (potentially tanking the stock price and causing other financial issues), the assessment rules for private businesses might result in them being overvalued, large penalties for understating liabilities, unusual language defining anti-tax avoidance measures, and a substantial tax that can be assigned to taxpayers that get married or divorced. While the proposed California billionaire tax is still far from a reality, both the potential benefits and consequences have become increasingly apparent. Should billionaires decide to depart California, they will still be liable for paying the wealth tax if the bill is passed. However, whether and under what circumstances this tax is challenged in court, upheld, and collected is a completely different story. Thus, California lawmakers and taxpayers must carefully balance the costs and benefits of attempting to levy such a tax on its 200 billionaires given the uncertainty in the outcomes.

Title: Inequality and unease are rising as elite Davos event opens with pro-business Trump set to attend

By JAMEY KEATEN DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — Corporate chiefs and government leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress — even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind. The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of “improving the state of the world,” and this year’s theme is “A spirit of dialogue.” One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees — or at them. Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI’s impact on jobs; concerns about geo-economic conflict; tariffs that have rocked longstanding trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries. “It’s really going to be a discussion at a very important moment … geopolitics is changing,” said Mirek Dušek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. “Some people think we’re in a transition. Some people think we’ve already entered a new era. But I think it’s undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape.” Trump’s third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela’s oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike. Trump’s peace-making credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his “ Board of Peace ” for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center. The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics. Critics will also be nearby: He’s blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee; Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran, whose leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, was set to speak but organizers on Monday canceled his appearance, saying “the tragic loss of civilian lives” means “it is not right” for the government to be represented. The two likeliest counterweights to Trump’s administration on the international scene — China and the European Union — get top billing on the first day: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China’s “economic czar” — as Dušek put it. The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge. This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world’s most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies – along with celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon. The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes. The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand. Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and “grievance” last year has morphed into broader “insularity.” “People are retreating from dialogue and compromise, choosing the safety of the familiar over the perceived risk of change,” said CEO Richard Edelman. “We favor nationalism over global connection and individual gain over joint progress. Our mentality has shifted from ‘we’ to ‘me’.” The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbors, while nearly 70% believed institutional leaders — such as from business or government — deliberately mislead the public. Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16% last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than $18 trillion. It drew on Forbes magazine data on the world’s richest people. Oxfam said the $2.5 trillion rise in the wealth of billionaires last year would be enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world’s population lives in poverty, the group said. The Trump administration has led a “pro-billionaire agenda,” the group said, through actions such as slashing taxes for the wealthiest, fostering the growth of AI-related stocks that help rich investors get richer, and thwarting efforts to tax giant companies. The advocacy group wants more national efforts to reduce inequality, higher taxes on the ultra-rich to reduce their power, and greater limits on their ability to shape policy through lobbying. With such concerns filtering through to policymakers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday. As usual, protesters rallied over the weekend in and near Davos ahead of the event. Hundreds of marchers scaled an Alpine road up to the town on Saturday behind a banner in German that read “No Profit from War” and alongside a truck that bore a sign: World Economic Failure.

Davos storekeepers rent out their premises so that forum participants can have the prime real estate for the week. Critics have long accused the annual meeting of generating more rhetoric than results, and they see Trump’s return as sign of the disconnect between haves and have-nots. Some say Swiss leaders who support the event and flock to Davos too are adding to the problem. “It is worrying how Swiss politicians are courting warmongers and their profiteers in Davos,” said Mirjam Hostetmann, president of Switzerland’s Young Socialists, who have led protests against the event. “The WEF will never bring peace, but will only fuel escalation.” AP World Economic Forum: https://apnews.com/hub/world-economic-forum

Your generous monthly contribution— or whatever you can give—will help secure our future. Jamey Keaten, Associated Press Jamey Keaten, Associated Press Leave your feedback DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — Corporate chiefs and government leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress — even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind. WATCH: Darren Walker explores inequality and democracy in 'The Idea of America' The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of "improving the state of the world," and this year's theme is "A spirit of dialogue." One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees — or at them. Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI's impact on jobs; concerns about geo-economic conflict; tariffs that have rocked longstanding trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries. "It's really going to be a discussion at a very important moment ... geopolitics is changing," said Mirek Dušek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. "Some people think we're in a transition. Some people think we've already entered a new era. But I think it's undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape." Trump's third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela's oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike. Trump's peace-making credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his " Board of Peace " for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center. The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics. Critics will also be nearby. Trump has blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran was set to speak, but his appearance was cancelled. Iran's leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, and organizers said Monday that "the tragic loss of civilian lives" means "it is not right" for the government to be represented. The two likeliest counterweights to Trump's administration on the international scene — China and the European Union — get top billing on the first day: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China's "economic czar" — as Dušek put it. The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge. This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world's most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies — along with celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon. The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes. The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand. Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and "grievance" last year has morphed into broader "insularity."

The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbors, while nearly 70% believed institutional leaders — such as from business or government — deliberately mislead the public. WATCH: Jamie Dimon on how economic inequality fueled political polarization and what can be done Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16% last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than $18 trillion.

Title: Well, there goes the metaverse! | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept. Few are going to miss it. As industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices. In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more. Meta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets. Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI. According to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire. And last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well. The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers. Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit. In total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending. Besides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate. That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments. Meta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers. Specifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores. “This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.” He proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030. Meta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size. Though there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity. From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta. For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.) But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more. Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy. As bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely. In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior. At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached. These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.” Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!) Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week. With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.) With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass. Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models.

Investing ASML holds a virtual monopoly in lithography machines essential for manufacturing advanced AI chips. ASML stock gained 80% over one year and now trades at 44.6 times forward earnings. Memory makers are expanding DRAM capacity aggressively to meet surging 2026 AI demand. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Michael Vi / iStock Editorial via Getty Images The semiconductor stocks have enjoyed another big leg higher to start the year. With unprecedented AI demand and aggressive AI data center builds pushing the fabs to ramp up on capacity expansions, it should be no surprise to see the broader basket of semiconductor names making up for lost time. With the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) surging more than 9% so far in 2026, it certainly feels like the AI trade is back on. And if you’ve rotated out of the names, the feeling of FOMO (fear of missing out) might nudge you to get back into some of the names you may have sold out of in the recent months of relative choppiness. With a memory chip shortage powering the data storage firms higher while the more cyclical semiconductor equipment makers get in on the boom, many may be wondering if it’s too late to act on the latest upswing in the hottest of semiconductor plays. Though the memory makers might be a tad overheated right here, I do see plenty of value in the more cyclical semiconductor equipment makers. Notably, shares of ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) look like a great catch-up trade for investors who want a massive beneficiary without having to pay as high a premium. Of course, the stock has already gone parabolic, gaining about 80% in just the past year. With 17% of the gains coming year to date, though, the shares are seemingly going vertical, as the photolithography machinery (it’s necessary for making the latest and greatest AI chips) orders come in hot. Undoubtedly, demand seems to be off the charts for AI chips, and that’s finding its way down to the equipment makers themselves. With a virtual monopoly over lithography machines, it’s the only game in town for a lot of fabs. And while the past-year run has been magnificent, many analysts see more upside for the firm as the wave of AI looks to lift it significantly higher. The stock might be hot, but it’s not nearly as hot as its peers. Shares are up just over 25% from their 2024 peak, which isn’t exactly bubbly, at least not in my view. In any case, a number of analysts see shares of ASML rising over $1,500 for the year ahead. As foundries look to expand capacity, I do not doubt that ASML could have the potential to surprise to the upside for its coming quarters. But given the steep ups and downs in the semi equipment makers, there is bound to be an upset at some point. I think we’re closer to the start of a boom than the end of one. But at 44.6 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), could investors be pricing in too much of the boom? It’s tough to tell, but the EUV machine makers are the place to be right now. And there’s potential for shares of ASML to lift off in a similar manner as the memory chip makers. Anywhere you look on Wall Street, it’s not too hard to find a bull on the Dutch semi equipment maker, especially as memory makers rush to invest to meet demand for DRAM, which nobody can seem to get enough of in 2026. All considered, I view ASML as a solid semiconductor pick and perhaps one of the more intriguing ones as the semiconductor scene experiences another massive growth spurt. Perhaps there was a reason Michael Burry got out of his bearish bets against the semiconductor industry a few years ago. He was early, perhaps many, many years too early.

Title: Here Lies the Liberal World Order: 1945-2025

Back in 1989, renowned political scientist Francis Fukuyama got a little bit over his skis, as they say, when he enthusiastically welcomed in a new (and emphatically final) geopolitical epoch, audaciously dubbed the “End of History.” To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Русский, Español, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. From “The End of History?,” 1989: “The twentieth century saw the developed world descend into a paroxysm of ideological violence, as liberalism contended first with the remnants of absolutism, then bolshevism and fascism, and finally an updated Marxism that threatened to lead to the ultimate apocalypse of nuclear war. But the century that began full of self-confidence in the ultimate triumph of Western liberal democracy seems at its close to be returning full circle to where it started: not to an “end of ideology” or a convergence between capitalism and socialism, as earlier predicted, but to an unabashed victory of economic and political liberalism. The triumph of the West, of the Western idea, is evident first of all in the total exhaustion of viable systematic alternatives to Western liberalism. In the past decade, there have been unmistakable changes in the intellectual climate of the world’s two largest communist countries, and the beginnings of significant reform movements in both. But this phenomenon extends beyond high politics and it can be seen also in the ineluctable spread of consumerist Western culture in such diverse contexts as the peasants’ markets and color television sets now omnipresent throughout China, the cooperative restaurants and clothing stores opened in the past year in Moscow, the Beethoven piped into Japanese department stores, and the rock music enjoyed alike in Prague, Rangoon, and Tehran. What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.” Liberalism today, liberalism tomorrow, liberalism forever! to paraphrase notorious Alabama segregationist George Wallace. In chronological context, it was an understandable misapprehension that afflicted Fukuyama and clouded his crystal ball; in 1989, getting high on the liberal order supply was easy. No serious ideological rivals to liberalism existed any longer at the international level; the liberal order, with the United States at the head, exercised global hegemony; everybody the world over wanted a pair of blue jeans and a Chevy Corvette and a hot blonde on their arm and all of the glorious excesses of liberal capitalism. Alas, the utopian “End of History,” ironically, didn’t last long; by 2026, universalist liberalism has now reached what very much looks like the end of the line a mere three and a half decades since Fukuyama declared it the “final form of human government.” So-called “international law,” which underpins the global liberal order, has always been heavier on the aspiration and lighter on the actual, existing in a nether-region between theory and practicality, applied and adhered to erratically and arbitrarily — with no consequences for those who violate it, provided they have the military power to thwart attempts at accountability. Lots of examples abound, but a prime one, which has received relatively little attention with the heavy media focus on Latin America and the Middle East, was Xi Jinping announcing in his New Year’s address that the forced “reunification” of Taiwan into the budding Sino Empire is “unstoppable” — a barely veiled flouting of the international powers that would threaten to oppose such a move militarily. (I predict China will pull the trigger on the kinetic invasion before the end of the year if it can’t submit Taiwan through economic or political pressure under threat of military action — the latter approach it would prefer for reasons of optics and because Taiwan is ethnically Chinese, likely tempering the bloodlust as the Chinese view the Taiwanese as their kin.) While China has long signaled its intent to reclaim Taiwan, which it lost in the middle of the last century as the last stronghold of the nationalists fighting the CCP, Xi would not have offered such direct talk just a year ago. Yet, inch by inch, as the liberal order loses its grip on geopolitics, with it goes the diplomatic imperative to couch rhetoric in terms in keeping with international law. In the same vein, Trump has more or less openly admitted that the political, economic and, military pressure applied to Venezuela, including the capture of its president, is about regional hegemony and natural resources: “We are going to have our very large United States oil companies go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken oil infrastructure and start making money for the country,” he said. The Western hemisphere “belongs to us,” the mantra has gone of late. (“Us” meaning, ostensibly, the United States and the citizens thereof, although I don’t feel it belongs to me as an American citizen quite as much as it will soon belong to Blackrock, Palantir, and Chevron.) In a way, the Venezuela rhetoric is much more honest than the obviously insincere 2003-era talk of delivering “democracy” to Iraq, Afghanistan, et al. Those countries were never going to adopt “democracy” even if the United States government insisted on it — which, despite the nonstop lip service, it didn’t anyway because it didn’t care much for constitutional republicanism at home, let alone abroad. Nonetheless, liberal etiquette required the lie to maintain the façade that the world runs on democratic values. So what will replace international liberalism? Something, probably, on the order of multipolar realism — again, much less idealistic yet much more honest in a world that hitherto has functioned on pretty lies. Via Independent Institute (emphasis added): “Realism is one of the prominent international relations theories for explaining the behavior of states. The core essence of realism is an attempt to explain “world politics as they really are, rather than describe how they ought to be,” presenting the world as a state of anarchy where nations, acting as unitary rational actors, compete with each other to maximize their power, “the only—variable of interest.” Realism is often juxtaposed with liberalism, the belief that the “national characteristics of individual States matter for their international relations” and that it is possible for different types of regimes to operate in different ways, such as Kant’s theory of democratic peace. Liberal “institutionalism,” the ideology on which diplomats in the West are brought up, is the belief that “international institutions facilitate cooperation and peace among countries.” The difference between these schools of thought can be understood through their perspectives on international institutions. While liberals assume that organizations like the United Nations are a genuine platform for international cooperation, realists assume that these institutions do very little to prevent states from pursuing their interests and can very often serve as a vector through which state interests are pursued.” * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Microsoft researchers have revealed the 40 jobs most exposed to AI—and even teachers make the list

As companies like Amazon publicly announce AI-driven workforce reductions, workers are scrambling to understand which careers might soon disappear and be outsourced to technology. A report from Microsoft researchers studying the occupational implications of generative AI offers some clarity. Translators, historians, and writers are among the roles with the highest AI applicability score, meaning the job’s tasks are most closely aligned with AI’s current abilities, according to the report that ranked professions. Customer service and sales representatives—which make up about 5 million jobs in the U.S.—will also have to compete with AI. Overall, the jobs most exposed are ones that involve knowledge work—like people doing computer, math, or administrative work in an office, the researchers wrote. Sales jobs are also high on the list, since they often involve sharing and explaining information. While Microsoft said high applicability doesn’t automatically mean those jobs will necessarily be replaced by AI, the list of roles quickly went viral—with professionals deeming them “most at risk.” It comes as companies like IBM have been freezing thousands of would-be new roles that it expects AI will take over in the next 5 years, and graduates in the U.K. are facing the worst job market since 2018 as employers pause hiring and use AI to cut costs, said Indeed. Of course, there are some jobs that are unlikely to be touched by AI: Dredge operators; bridge and lock tenders; and water treatment plant and system operators are among the jobs with virtually no generative AI exposure, thanks in part to their hands-on equipment requirements. Still, business leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have said every job will be touched by AI in some way, and so it’s best to embrace it. “Every job will be affected, and immediately. It is unquestionable,” Huang said at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in 2025. “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.” Many of the jobs with high chances of getting upended by AI soon, like political scientists, journalists, and management analysts, are all ones that typically require a four-year degree to land a job. And as the researchers point out, having a degree—which was once considered a surefire path to career advancement—is no longer a safeguard against the changing tides. “In terms of education requirements, we find higher AI applicability for occupations requiring a Bachelor’s degree than occupations with lower requirements,” wrote the researchers, who studied 200,000 real-world conversations of Copilot users and cross-compared the AI’s performance with occupational data. On the flip side, there are some career paths with low AI exposure, that are growing in demand. The health care sector, in particular, is an area that is experiencing this heavily. The home health and personal care aid industry is expected to create among the greatest number of new jobs over the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. At the same time, the researchers recognized even their findings don’t capture the full scope of the AI revolution—and there could be further automation caused by more than just generative technology: “Our measurement is purely about LLMs: other applications of AI could certainly affect occupations involving operating and monitoring machinery, such as truck driving.” Kiran Tomlinson, a senior Microsoft researcher, told Fortune the study focused on highlighting where AI might change how work is done, not take away or replace jobs. “Our research shows that AI supports many tasks, particularly those involving research, writing, and communication, but does not indicate it can fully perform any single occupation. As AI adoption accelerates, it’s important that we continue to study and better understand its societal and economic impact,” Tomlinson said. After seeing the rollercoaster of layoffs across the tech industry over the past few years, many Gen Zers have turned to seemingly steadier fields like education. The sector was the fastest-growing industry among recent U.K. graduates last year, and it was similarly a top career choice for American graduates. And while the profession can provide further work-life balance and decent benefits, the ability for AI to do the work may cause further headache. The report singles out farm and home management educators—as well as postsecondary economics, business, and library science teachers—as roles with relatively high AI applicability. While it’s unlikely that schools will roll out AI teachers en masse, the report’s findings underscore how quickly the technology could reshape the education profession—and many others.

Minneapolis, the sucking chest wound on America’s body politic, gets a break this week from Gawda’mighty, who is turning the heat down to subzero so that ICE-Watch nose-rings can hole-up in their Soros-paid motels, play League of Legends with their DoorDashed Chick-fil-A nuggets, and rest up for the next inning of their motley revolution. ICE itself might even have to lay off its daily round-up of rapists, cut-throats, and child-molesters, to wait out the cold-snap. Meanwhile, things elsewhere roughen up a little. For instance: Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum (WEF) holds its annual jamboree of vampire squids. Klaus Schwab is out, by the way. He skulked off in a malodorous cloud of embezzlement and sexual irregularities, to be replaced by Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the hedge fund that owns everything in the USA and wants more. Larry Fink is living proof of the banality of evil, an early pioneer of mortgage-backed securities, which nearly blew up the global banking system in 2008-09, after which he pioneered the wholesale purchasing of foreclosed houses by hedge funds. Neat trick. Cornered the market on all the inventory, so, now, nobody under age-fifty in America can afford to buy a house — but you can rent one from BlackRock! Larry Fink landed as interim head of the WEF largely because BlackRock has been espousing Klaus Schwab’s ideas about “Stakeholder Capitalism,” which allows global corporations to pretend that they have beneficent “societal purpose” while they go about ass-raping the common folk of Western Civ. Climate change and green new deals top that agenda, along with diversity, equity, and inclusion and additional bullshit about “environment, social, and governance factors” (ESG) in its global strategies portfolio — meaning, mandates for exactly the kind of policies that are destroying Europe’s economies, de-industrialization foremost.

This blog is sponsored this week by Vaulted, an online mobile web app for investing in allocated and deliverable physical gold. To learn more visit: Vaulted.com Among the invited speakers at Davos this year: one US President Donald Trump. He is going to kill them with kindness, a tongue-bath of Trumpian compliments — you are the greatest. . . beautiful leaders like the world has never seen before — while he artfully inserts a stiletto in the WEF’s liver. You might not even know that the org is a walking corpse until a few weeks after the Davos meeting shuts down. But Mr. Trump is going to terminate its influence and send a message that the era of globalist shenanigans is over. The president can point to two demonstration projects. First, the USA’s acquisition of Greenland one way or another, either ownership or some leasing agreement or revised treaty arrangement. You can be sure that the EU does not like that — big bully America picking on cuddly little Denmark, “the world’s happiest country.” But since they are happily oblivious to Greenland’s strategic importance (vis-a-vis China’s nefarious ambitions there) it is up to America to prepare the game-board. The art of the deal, of course, is making it fait accompli before the targeted property-owner has even entered the discussion. How that works will be a painful discovery for the walking dead Davosanistas. The second demo will be how the recent arrest of Nicolás Maduro leads to revelations of the globalist conspiracy to interfere in elections here, there, and everywhere. Señor Maduro sold his Smartmatic system to all comers, and you can bet that the plea bargain talks are already underway in Brooklyn (if not already concluded). Yes, it is our old friend, the Kraken, which is a related species of giant squid to the vampire variety convened in Davos. This election fraud business is really consequential. It redounds to the criminality of the Democratic Party that had the impudence to jam an enfeebled marionette, “Joe Biden,” into the Oval Office, allowing a treasonous cabal of nihilists to nearly wreck the country. The massive evidence of that crime was clumsily suppressed by the cabal and its allies in the news business. But it is surfacing again, now with Señor Maduro’s imprimatur, and it will turn into a force five storm off the coast of Florida as grand juries in Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale were empaneled a week ago to consider the myriad lawless operations mounted against Mr. Trump since 2015, including election fraud. The lawless are going to be rounded up, from Raffensperger in Georgia, to Katie Hobbs in Arizona, to Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, to Jena Griswold in Colorado, to dozens of other officials who were in on the big vote switcheroo of Nov. 3, 2020. And when the revelations finally come, it will be too much for the foot-dragging villains in the US Senate to continue resisting — they will have to pass the SAVE Act or some legislation like it that requires voter ID, one election day, and paper ballots counted by humans, not machines. It remains to be seen whether the Democratic Party goes extinct because of its exposed, widespread criminality, or because it simply can’t win an election without massive ballot fraud.

A call for unity and grace from the mountains high, to the wave crashed coasts: "The person down the street who votes differently than you is not your enemy. They are your neighbor. They worry about the same things you worry about. They want their kids to be safe and their bills to be paid and their country to be a place worth living in. They have been manipulated just like you have been manipulated, fed a different flavor of the same poison, sorted into a different tribe by the same algorithm, pointed at you as the enemy by the same people who point you at them. The working class Republican and the working class Democrat have more in common with each other than either of them has with the billionaire class that funds both parties. You share the same struggles. You face the same rigged systems. You are being crushed by the same economic forces that have transferred more wealth upward in the last fifty years than at any point in human history. And instead of uniting against the people doing this to you, you are screaming at each other on the internet about pronouns and flags and whatever fresh outrage the algorithm served up this morning. This is exactly what they want. A nation at war with itself cannot resist a takeover. A people consumed by mutual hatred will accept any authority that promises to protect them from the manufactured enemy. Every empire that fell was divided before it was conquered. Every free people who lost their freedom were set against each other first. The red versus blue war is not real. It is a show put on by people who own both teams. It is professional wrestling and you think it is a real fight. The wrestlers go backstage after the match and laugh together while you are still screaming at the guy in the other section who was rooting for the wrong character. This Is Our Country Not Theirs This nation belongs to the people who live here and work here and raise families here and will be buried here. It does not belong to billionaires who hold citizenship in three countries and will flee to their bunkers the moment things get bad. It does not belong to tech oligarchs who view democracy as an obstacle to efficiency. It does not belong to foreign interests who have purchased so much influence that they might as well be writing our laws themselves. We have to stop letting them divide us. We have to start seeing each other as fellow Americans again instead of enemy combatants in a culture war that was manufactured to keep us weak. We have to remember that the person screaming at us online is also a victim of the same manipulation, and maybe if we stopped screaming back and started talking, we might realize we have been fighting the wrong enemy this entire time. Turn off the television. It is not informing you. It is programming you. Question everything, including the sources you trust, especially the sources you trust. Talk to people who disagree with you and do it without trying to win. Listen to why they believe what they believe. You might discover that the monster you have been told to hate is actually just another person trying to make sense of a confusing world with imperfect information, exactly like you. Remember who you are. You are an American. Your ancestors came to this land or were brought to this land or were already on this land, and regardless of how they got here, they built something together that was supposed to be different from the old world’s tyrannies and aristocracies. That project is not finished. Every generation has to fight to keep it alive against the forces that want to drag us back to a world where a handful of rulers own everything and everyone else serves at their pleasure. Stop letting them divide you. Your enemies are not your neighbors. Your enemies are the people who profit from your division and are building machines to replace you the moment you are no longer useful. Start acting like it before it is too late". —The Wise Wolf "We must learn to live together as brothers, or we will perish together as fools."

Title: Inequality and unease are rising as elite Davos event opens with pro-business Trump set to attend

Full Content:
The Swiss town of Davos hosts the annual meeting of elites from business, government and culture this week DAVOS, Switzerland -- Corporate chiefs and government leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress — even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind. The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of “improving the state of the world," and this year's theme is “A spirit of dialogue.” One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees — or at them. Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI's impact on jobs; concerns about geo-economic conflict; tariffs that have rocked longstanding trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries. “It’s really going to be a discussion at a very important moment ... geopolitics is changing," said Mirek Dušek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. "Some people think we’re in a transition. Some people think we’ve already entered a new era. But I think it’s undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape.” Trump’s third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela’s oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike. Trump’s peace-making credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his “ Board of Peace ” for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center. The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics. Critics will also be nearby. Trump has blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran was set to speak, but his appearance was cancelled. Iran's leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, and organizers said Monday that "the tragic loss of civilian lives" means “it is not right” for the government to be represented. The two likeliest counterweights to Trump’s administration on the international scene — China and the European Union — get top billing on the first day: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China’s “economic czar” — as Dušek put it. The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge. This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world’s most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies — along with celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon. The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes. The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand. Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and “grievance” last year has morphed into broader “insularity.” “People are retreating from dialogue and compromise, choosing the safety of the familiar over the perceived risk of change,” said CEO Richard Edelman. “We favor nationalism over global connection and individual gain over joint progress. Our mentality has shifted from ‘we’ to ‘me’.” The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbors, while nearly 70% believed institutional leaders — such as from business or government — deliberately mislead the public. Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16% last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than $18 trillion. It drew on Forbes magazine data on the world’s richest people. Oxfam said the $2.5 trillion rise in the wealth of billionaires last year would be enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world’s population lives in poverty, the group said. The Trump administration has led a “pro-billionaire agenda,” the group said, through actions such as slashing taxes for the wealthiest, fostering the growth of AI-related stocks that help rich investors get richer, and thwarting efforts to tax giant companies. The advocacy group wants more national efforts to reduce inequality, higher taxes on the ultra-rich to reduce their power, and greater limits on their ability to shape policy through lobbying. With such concerns filtering through to policymakers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday. As usual, protesters rallied over the weekend in and near Davos ahead of the event. Hundreds of marchers scaled an Alpine road up to the town on Saturday behind a banner in German that read “No Profit from War” and alongside a truck that bore a sign: World Economic Failure. Companies like Microsoft, India's Tata Consultancy, social media titan TikTok and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike joined governments from countries such as Nigeria, Qatar, Ukraine and the United States — a USA House is making a debut this year — to set up shop on the Davos Promenade to promote their services, products and national economies. Davos storekeepers rent out their premises so that forum participants can have the prime real estate for the week. Critics have long accused the annual meeting of generating more rhetoric than results, and they see Trump's return as sign of the disconnect between haves and have-nots. Some say Swiss leaders who support the event and flock to Davos too are adding to the problem. “It is worrying how Swiss politicians are courting warmongers and their profiteers in Davos,” said Mirjam Hostetmann, president of Switzerland's Young Socialists, who have led protests against the event. “The WEF will never bring peace, but will only fuel escalation.” __ AP World Economic Forum: https://apnews.com/hub/world-economic-forum 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Our Ultimate Alexa Command List: 200+ Voice Commands for Echos and Smart Homes

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Welcome to your complete guide to all the Alexa and Alexa Plus commands you'll need for your life and home, from productivity to games. The newest Echo speakers are a great excuse to brush up on your Alexa commands. Amazon's Alexa voice assistant just had an epic year. Alexa Plus is finally out, offering AI-powered conversational features and advanced capabilities that go way beyond setting timers and playlists. But even if you're happy with your conventional Alexa voice commands, you may not know everything it's capable of, whether on an Echo speaker or your phone. From ordering an Uber to managing your calendar or movie watchlist, we're going over the top ways to use Alexa -- with a complete list of well over 200 options. And if you're worried about privacy, you should know our latest voice assistant survey found that Alexa is the most trusted voice assistant in the US, and you can change settings to help improve anonymity. Now let's get started with the newest commands we like. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $20 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa Plus aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include the following: Add in the latest third-party app connections supported specifically by Alexa Plus, and your capabilities greatly expand to some of our favorite interactions yet: Alexa Plus is going to get more of these in-depth interactions, too, with connections to Takrabit, Fandango, Grubhub and more coming soon. Before rolling out Alexa Plus, Amazon announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Title: America's new sink-or-swim era is here

Tara Turk-Haynes hired yoga instructors and meditation gurus to help employees handle burnout at the media company where she worked. She's not doing anything like that today. Wellness perks are no longer "a thing," said Turk-Haynes, now an independent HR consultant in Los Angeles. "Attracting and retaining talent is not a business challenge right now." The white-collar workplace has gotten a lot less cuddly in the past few years, as the economic bargain between employers and employees has been redefined. Perks have vanished, in-office mandates are on the rise, and layoffs continue even as profits hold up — changes that reflect a system that prioritizes shareholder returns over stakeholder capitalism and corporate loyalty. With job openings thinning, wages struggling to keep pace with inflation, and AI looming as a threat to entire occupations, the recalibration is altering how advancement and compensation are determined inside companies — a new reality that some workers view as destabilizing, and others see as a long-overdue reset. "When COVID happened, there was a shift in power from employers to employees with the Great Resignation," said Jessica Kriegel, chief strategy officer at workplace consulting firm Culture Partners in Sacramento, Calif. "The pendulum swung really far. Now it's swinging back." This story is part of Business Insider's series "The Future of Capitalism," which looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth. Earlier this month, Meta began rolling out a new employee evaluation program that ties career advancement and financial rewards to measurable impact, while Citi CEO Jane Fraser issued a memo saying she expects higher performance this year and to see "the last vestiges of old, bad habits fall away."

In August, AT&T's John Stankey told managers the company had moved away from a tenure-based "employment deal" toward one "focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment." Meanwhile, some CEOs, particularly those aligned with the Trump administration, have become more outspoken about their political views, suggesting diminished concern about alienating talent. In November, Palantir CEO Alex Karp told analysts on an earnings call that his software company is the first "to be completely anti-woke." The shift toward a more explicitly capitalistic workplace is taking hold even as leaders across the political spectrum are championing increased government involvement in private enterprise. The US, for example, has recently taken equity stakes in about a dozen private companies—an unusual expansion of direct federal ownership in the private sector. Now, even though the economy is relatively healthy, most employers are planning to trim or maintain head count this year, survey data show, while white-collar workers are job-hugging and bracing for more layoffs. "There is pressure on CEOs from investors and shareholders to continue to grow," said Kriegel. "And that pressure is getting pushed down onto employees." The current moment stands apart, though it's not the first time the pendulum has shifted toward employers. The dot-com bust in the early 2000s and the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 also cooled hiring. Both events, however, coincided with steep stock market declines, whereas the post-pandemic period has been marked by generally strong results on Wall Street. "The stock market's doing well, record-setting, and yet companies are squeezing their employees," said Peter Cappelli, professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. The rise of AI has also posed a new existential threat to workers. Many employers see the potential for the technology to replace human talent through automation, and some have cited AI directly or indirectly as a reason for layoffs. "Before asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI," wrote Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke in an April memo to the company's employees. To be sure, employers' labor costs — typically their largest expense — are on the rise. For one, the average price of employer-sponsored health insurance in the US is expected to increase 6.7% this year, up from 4.5% in 2024, according to consulting firm Mercer. Businesses have also incurred a new expense: AI investments, including chatbot licenses and employee training. Research firm IDC forecasts that US-based firms will spend roughly $320 billion on AI hardware, software, and services this year. Those costs come as corporate leaders are navigating what they describe as a shakier economic environment. Mentions of "economic uncertainty" on US public company earnings calls more than doubled in 2025 compared with the prior year, according to market-intelligence platform AlphaSense. Employment experts say the uncertainty helps explain why the job market has been stuck in a low-hire, low-fire state. Even as large companies such as Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, and Disney announced massive layoffs last year, the overall rate of layoffs and discharges stayed below historical norms, Labor Department data show. The result is a labor market full of contradictions, said Nicole Bachaud, an economist at ZipRecruiter. "That's why it feels so weird," she said. The unemployment rate finished last year at 4.4%, near historic lows. Still, many professionals lack confidence in the job market as career opportunities in once-reliable sectors, such as technology and the federal government, have thinned. "Psychologically, it's damaging," said Lars Schmidt, a recruiting executive in the Washington, D.C., area. In industries where jobs were plentiful, workers generally knew how long it would take to find a new position if they craved change. Now, "most people don't have any safe prediction of what that may be," Schmidt said. Another drag on confidence is the bleak employment outlook. A recent survey of US CEOs by the Yale School of Management shows that nearly two-thirds plan to maintain or reduce head count in 2026. Further, average annual pay increases are forecast to remain flat in 2026, despite continued high inflation and after shrinking in recent years, according to Mercer. These factors may help explain why workers feel economically insecure. Nearly a third of Americans expect their finances to worsen this year, according to a December survey by Bankrate. That is the highest level of pessimism since 2018, when the personal-finance site began asking consumers about their financial outlook. Against that backdrop, workers are increasingly reluctant to quit. The US quit rate has fallen below pre-pandemic norms, federal data show, even as more employers mandate five days in the office and track workers' hours and AI usage. All of this leaves workers with little appetite for pushback, said Jeff LeBlanc, a management lecturer at Bentley University. "You're not going to see a big revolt," he said. "I don't think people have it in them right now." Though the overall job market forecast is gloomy, there are some bright spots for workers. Demand is robust for people who can build out AI applications across industries, said Aditya Challapally, who teaches a course for Stanford Online about generative AI. "This is a small, but rapidly growing niche," he said. AI fluency can help just about anyone get ahead in their career, added Challapally. Workers who understand AI are "able to move faster, make better decisions, and take on higher-leverage work," he said. Hiring is also strong in healthcare, social assistance, and leisure and hospitality, according to recent data from the US Labor Department. Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at job site Indeed, expects the overall labor market to improve as long as the economy continues to grow. "This low-hire, low-fire environment cannot last forever," she said. "At some point, companies will need to start hiring more." In the meantime, some workers are regaining a sense of control by taking on freelance or contract gigs that they could parley into full-time work should they get laid off. Others are starting their own businesses, tapping AI tools to get up and running quickly. Adopting a side hustle is safer than quitting a job and launching a search for a new one right now because the market is just so competitive, said John Ferguson, an HR consultant and former chief human resources officer at NASCAR. "If you don't have the next opportunity lined up, I encourage you to stay where you are," he said. "But also plan your exit strategy." Jump to

Title: Teamsters President Sean O’Brien kicks off reelection campaign
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2026/01/19/teamsters-president-sean-obrien-kicks-off-reelection-campaign/
Time Published: 2026-01-19T10:10:56Z

Teamsters President Sean O’Brien kicked off a 2026 reelection bid in Charlestown on Sunday — defending his record, speaking to the future and warning his opponent that Teamsters politics are a “full contact sport.” “We need a full court press going into Las Vegas in June,” said O’Brien to a lively packed crowd of supporters. “We’re going to send a message. Send a message that we are united, and we are ready to fight. And our opponents need to understand, it’s a full contact sport. They need to put the helmets on and buckle the chinstraps. It’s gonna be a long game.” O’Brien, who was elected general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for a five year term in 2022, is running for reelection along with Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman. The incumbents face a challenge from Philadelphia-based head of Teamsters local 623 Richard Hooker Jr., and his “Fearless 2026” slate. Candidates need at least 5% of delegates at a Teamsters convention in June to advance to the November election. O’Brien held his kick-off rally at the Knights of Columbus in Charlestown at noon Sunday, cheered on by a hometown crowd. The president highlighted his accomplishments over his five years in office, including organizing over 90,000 new members — noting he hopes to hit 100,000 by the end of 2026 — securing financial stability for members on strike, making sure no contract can be implemented that members vote down and ensuring rank and file members a seat at bargaining tables. “There is no union that is doing what we’re doing,” O’Brien said. “We negotiated the largest settlement and the largest collective bargaining agreement in the entire country. When people didn’t think we could do it, we got a $30 million deal. We negotiated the strongest contracts in the food service, in the rubbish, in the airline, in every single every single division we represent.” O’Brien also came at Hooker directly, saying “if you listen to him, you think he’s running against Donald Trump, not Sean O’Brien.” Hooker has been a vocal critic of the relationship between Trump and O’Brien, who met privately with the president and spoke at the Republican national convention ahead of his election. “He has not discussed one platform of what he’s going to do to improve this union,” O’Brien said, accusing the challenger of only organizing two contracts. In response to the rally, the Hooker campaign contended the candidate has negotiated five contracts, with two being first time contracts, since being elected in 2020. “Our campaign has explicitly talked about member power and how plan on giving it to them,” the Hooker campaign said. … “One of the campaign platforms is to lower the per capita revenue the international union receives so local unions can survive. With so many layoffs and building closures happening in our ranks, local union will lose resources to fight against employers. Without the resources, local unions will have a difficult time to organize new workers.” O’Brien noted the goal is to make sure the opposition does not even advance to the November ballot. “Of course, why wouldn’t you want to run when the pensions are fixed, when the strike benefit at its highest, when membership continues to grow,” said O’Brien. “F—, that’s pretty easy, isn’t it, to walk in, but we’re not going to look back. We’re going to look forward.” The president spoke to continued “trials and tribulations” ahead of the union, calling Amazon the “largest white collar crime syndicate in the world.” “They’re represented in every single division we represent,” said O’Brien. “They’re our biggest threat. And by us getting the strongest contracts in each in all divisions, we are empowering the non-union to look at what we’re achieving.” The crowd was enthusiastically supportive of O’Brien and Zuckerman Sunday, packing into the event space and cheering loudly. O’Brien called the rally the largest attended union meeting in five years. “We’re going to keep going to every state, every city,” said O’Brien. “Make sure that we’re getting our message out there, make sure we’re talking to members, make sure they’re included and make sure we’re transparent about what our agenda is moving forward for the next five years, and just execute it.”

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber) DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — Corporate chiefs and government leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress — even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind. The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of “improving the state of the world,” and this year’s theme is “A spirit of dialogue.” One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees — or at them. Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI’s impact on jobs; concerns about geo-economic conflict; tariffs that have rocked longstanding trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries. “It’s really going to be a discussion at a very important moment ... geopolitics is changing,” said Mirek Dušek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. “Some people think we’re in a transition. Some people think we’ve already entered a new era. But I think it’s undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape.” Trump’s third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela’s oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike. Trump’s peace-making credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his “ Board of Peace ” for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center. The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics. Critics will also be nearby. Trump has blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran was set to speak, but his appearance was cancelled. Iran’s leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, and organizers said Monday that “the tragic loss of civilian lives” means “it is not right” for the government to be represented. The two likeliest counterweights to Trump’s administration on the international scene — China and the European Union — get top billing on the first day: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China’s “economic czar” — as Dušek put it. The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge. This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world’s most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies — along with celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon. The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes. The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand. Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and “grievance” last year has morphed into broader “insularity.” “People are retreating from dialogue and compromise, choosing the safety of the familiar over the perceived risk of change,” said CEO Richard Edelman. “We favor nationalism over global connection and individual gain over joint progress. Our mentality has shifted from ‘we’ to ‘me’.” The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbors, while nearly 70% believed institutional leaders — such as from business or government — deliberately mislead the public. Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16% last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than $18 trillion. It drew on Forbes magazine data on the world’s richest people. Oxfam said the $2.5 trillion rise in the wealth of billionaires last year would be enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world’s population lives in poverty, the group said. The Trump administration has led a “pro-billionaire agenda,” the group said, through actions such as slashing taxes for the wealthiest, fostering the growth of AI-related stocks that help rich investors get richer, and thwarting efforts to tax giant companies. The advocacy group wants more national efforts to reduce inequality, higher taxes on the ultra-rich to reduce their power, and greater limits on their ability to shape policy through lobbying. With such concerns filtering through to policymakers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday. As usual, protesters rallied over the weekend in and near Davos ahead of the event. Hundreds of marchers scaled an Alpine road up to the town on Saturday behind a banner in German that read “No Profit from War” and alongside a truck that bore a sign: World Economic Failure. Companies like Microsoft, India’s Tata Consultancy, social media titan TikTok and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike joined governments from countries such as Nigeria, Qatar, Ukraine and the United States — a USA House is making a debut this year — to set up shop on the Davos Promenade to promote their services, products and national economies. Davos storekeepers rent out their premises so that forum participants can have the prime real estate for the week. Critics have long accused the annual meeting of generating more rhetoric than results, and they see Trump’s return as sign of the disconnect between haves and have-nots. Some say Swiss leaders who support the event and flock to Davos too are adding to the problem. “It is worrying how Swiss politicians are courting warmongers and their profiteers in Davos,” said Mirjam Hostetmann, president of Switzerland’s Young Socialists, who have led protests against the event. “The WEF will never bring peace, but will only fuel escalation.” __ AP World Economic Forum: https://apnews.com/hub/world-economic-forum Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

Title: Fortune 100 companies are back in the office — but 'work from home dark matter' is thriving under the radar

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Remote work is far from dead — it's just learned to live in the shadows. Think of a big-name company, and there's a good chance it's rolled out a return-to-office mandate in the past couple of years. Amazon, AT&T, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Paramount Skydance have adopted a five-day-a-week office mandate, while Microsoft, Intel, and Starbucks have tightened their hybrid policies. As of the second quarter of 2025, a majority of Fortune 100 employees were subject to a full-time office mandate — up from just 5% two years prior — according to Placer.ai, a location intelligence and foot traffic data firm. Over the same period, the average number of required in-office days a week at these companies rose from 2.6 to 3.9, according to real estate consulting firm JLL. However, data reflecting how many US workers are actually in the office tells a different story, said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work. Bloom said actual work-from-home rates have remained fairly stable in recent years. He referred to it as "work-from-home dark matter" — a nod to the invisible material that makes up much of the universe. Like dark matter, remote work appears to be widespread, Bloom said, but may often be procured through special exceptions or flying under the radar. "We keep hearing endless stories of companies pushing employees to return, but we just don't see much of this in the survey, swipe-card or cellphone tracking data," he said. For companies, the apparent disconnect between rising return-to-office mandates and actual office attendance raises questions about whether employees and managers are complying with RTO policies. For workers, it suggests there may be more opportunities to work from home than they realize.

Fill out this form or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. Bloom's research, published on the WFH Research website he co-founded, shows that the share of work-from-home days in the US has held fairly steady over the past two years — fluctuating between roughly 25% and 30%. Bureau of Labor Statistics data backs this up. Bloom pointed to a few potential explanations for why work-from-home rates have remained resilient. One is that while fully remote arrangements have declined sharply since the height of the pandemic, hybrid setups — with employees splitting time between home and the office — have been adopted by many employers. Additionally, Bloom hypothesized that some employees have secured exceptions that allow them to work from home more frequently than their company's official policy permits. He believes many of these arrangements are "off the record" — granted by individual managers without formal company approval. Bloom said one reason some managers might allow these exceptions is that they're often evaluated based on their team's performance. If a manager is concerned that top employees will quit or become less productive under stricter in-office requirements, they may decide to offer more flexibility. "Managers are allowing employees extra days at home because they are high performers or hard to replace in their jobs," he said, adding, "Managers ultimately care about their team performance." One of these off-the-record exceptions was granted to a Wisconsin-based mother of three who works in a corporate role at a manufacturing company. When her employer announced a five-day-a-week in-office policy in 2023, she worried a two-hour round-trip commute would make it difficult to manage her childcare responsibilities. After an "off-the-record" conversation with her manager, she was told that as long as she came in a few days a week — especially for key in-person meetings — they wouldn't give her any trouble. "If I need to work from home for whatever reason, whether it's work or personal reasons, then that's OK," she said. Not every work-from-home exception is off the record. After struggling to make it into the office following day care drop-off, Georg Loewen, a senior director of digital marketing at a public relations agency, said his manager formally exempted him — for the time being — from the company's three-day-a-week in-office policy. "If drop-off ran long or parking didn't work out, I'd just work from home," said Loewen, who's in his 30s and lives in New Jersey. Loewen said he sometimes worries about how his arrangement might be perceived by coworkers who don't have the same flexibility, but that he has consistently felt supported. Bloom said he often hears about West Coast employees who are granted additional work-from-home flexibility because they have regular calls with colleagues in China or India that take place outside standard business hours. He also cited a case in which the head of a department at a Fortune 500 company was allowed to work remotely so his son, who had a health issue, could live near a specialist hospital. The survival of remote work isn't just about individual exceptions. While large employers have made headlines with return-to-office mandates, many smaller businesses and startups have quietly continued to offer flexibility. A report published last year by Flex Index, a platform that tracks flexible work policies, found that as of the third quarter of 2025, businesses with fewer than 500 employees were much more likely to offer flexible arrangements than Fortune 100 companies. And according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about half of US private-sector workers are employed at companies with fewer than 500 employees. Leslie Snipes is among the workers who have benefited from the flexibility of working at a small business. Snipes, a director of marketing at a Los Angeles-based creative agency with around 15 employees, said her 60- to 90-minute commute through LA traffic quickly took a toll during her first few months on the job. After speaking with her manager, she received formal approval to work almost exclusively remotely. She said she typically goes into the office once or twice a month to "show face" and connect with colleagues. "I feel less stressed, since I'm not spending hours sitting in traffic," said Snipes, who's in her 30s. "It's a setup I wouldn't have unless I asked." In addition to the explanations mentioned above, lower office attendance may also reflect limited desk availability at some offices. Some employees, however, have simply ignored RTO policies without their managers' approval — a move made easier, in some cases, by geographically distributed teams. Others have turned to "coffee badging," the practice of swiping into the office, grabbing a coffee, and leaving shortly afterward to meet attendance requirements. If a weaker job market persists and companies increasingly use attendance-tracking tools, more workers may be compelled to return to the office. On the flipside, a rebound in the labor market could empower workers to push for greater flexibility. Amid this uncertainty, Bloom said he's confident in the long-term outlook of remote work. "Work from home is here to stay," he said. "But it's mostly hybrid, and it seems it's mostly off-record." Juliana Kaplan contributed to this story. Jump to

The Swiss town of Davos hosts the annual meeting of elites from business, government and culture this week DAVOS, Switzerland -- Corporate chiefs and government leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress — even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind. The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of “improving the state of the world," and this year's theme is “A spirit of dialogue.” One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees — or at them.

Title: Fresh bagels in the polls, the rise of New Democracy, the finding about PASOK and President Maria, a napalm bomb in Lavrio (EAS), a Greek billionaire who is not a shipowner

Greetings, fresh pretzels in the polls, since today M.M. is also receiving its own survey on what has been happening in public opinion over the past week. So, New Democracy (ND) has a significant recovery compared to December—around 1.5%–2%, always including the extrapolations—which is mainly due to pensioners and public-sector employees who saw the first increase “after the budget–Pierrakakis measures” in pensions and salaries. The conclusion of the farmers’ issue also played a role, in the sense that the subsidies that were pending in December were paid, and at that time ND’s dip had appeared among respondents who are farmers and livestock breeders. Let me be clear, so we don’t exaggerate, that this one-and-a-half to maybe two points, more or less, is nothing shocking or “celebratory” for the governing party, but one way or another it “shows something,” according to the source who gave me the report: “What’s important is that our needle moves depending on the period and the events,” he told me. ND λοιπόν, according to this poll and always with the extrapolations, is at around 30%–30.5%, but the interesting part is what’s happening below that, where we have upheavals. Three existing parties—the PASOK, Velopoulos, and Zoe—are very close to one another, within the margin of statistical error, while Karystianou is clearly measured in second place at 15%, and Tsipras slightly below President Maria. Let me clarify that you will not see an “official percentage” for a party that has not been announced, from any regular polling company. Therefore, formally, PASOK will appear second with a slight difference from Zoe and Velos. SYRIZA is in the doldrums and Latinopoulou is quite pressured at the threshold; the KKE is also at its lows. The new surprise finding– From this survey, part of which you will certainly see within the week, what struck me is that for the first time a distinct shift is recorded from potential PASOK voters to ND—a small but distinct percentage, I repeat. I asked my source how he explains it, and he told me that “there is a serious centrist crowd that sees the circus going on in the opposition with President Maria and Tsipras, Zoe and Velopoulos, and thinks about what is going to happen in the future. They imagine Karystianou negotiating with Erdoğan… and PASOK pays the price,” he told me with a smile, while of course clarifying that we are making conjectures based on polls that are conducted every month, while we are 16 months away from the elections. The modest ceremony comes to an end…– Today K.M. is receiving the leaders of the farmers and has taken care to make it clear in every tone that there is no extra money, since improvements to the package initially announced have already been granted. The agricultural union leaders may put on heroic airs, but they have no desire to remain at the roadblocks after two months. What is needed, therefore, is a little… “cheese” in the so-called “technical” issues, in order to give them an excuse to exit. And even if they decide to play tough after the meeting, Mitsotakis will not concern himself further, given that society has already taken its eyes off the mobilizations. And, as he also says in his public statements, there are other social groups as well. Mitsotakis – ExxonMobil in Davos against the backdrop of hydrocarbon exploration– On the same panel as the head of ExxonMobil, Darren Woods, in a discussion on how Europe can escape stagnation, the prime minister will sit next Thursday as part of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The session, titled “Europe Is Treading Water, How Can It Make Waves?”, brings to the same table politicians, bankers, and top executives of the global economy. Along with the Greek prime minister will participate Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin, the president of the European Investment Bank Nadia Calviño, and Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing. This is a panel that captures the intersection of political power, financing, and business decisions, at a time when Europe is seeking ways to restart productivity and growth. The discussion takes place during a period in which European productivity remains stagnant, with key obstacles being the investment gap and high energy costs, as also highlighted in the Draghi Report. At the center is the role of investments in energy—alongside the green transition—as a factor in strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and energy security. However, the presence of the head of ExxonMobil gives the discussion an additional, informal but substantial dimension for Greece. The American company is a key international player—along with Chevron—in the concessions west and southwest of Crete, while it has expanded its presence in the country with its participation in Block 2 of the Ionian Sea. These are areas that, if the estimates are confirmed, could alter Greece’s energy map and strengthen its role in the Eastern Mediterranean. It is no coincidence that just in November, ExxonMobil vice president John Ardill, speaking from Athens, placed the decision for an exploratory drilling as early as 2026, with the prospect of implementation in 2027 and the start of natural gas production, if everything proceeds smoothly, in the early 2030s. In Block 2 of the Ionian Sea, a carbonate rock reservoir has already been identified at a depth of about 4,000 meters below sea level, with a potential deposit estimated at 200 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Management of the concession during the exploration period is held by Energean. The coming months are considered critical, as they will determine whether the existing timelines will turn into binding decisions. “Brake” on insurance premiums– In recent days I wrote to you about Theodorikakos’s message to insurance companies—who were heading toward increases of up to 15% in health insurance premiums—to hold back. In fact, a related meeting had taken place, and it appears that the gentlemen’s agreement will be honored by the insurers, who are indeed oriented toward increases, but at single-digit levels, as happened last year as well, taking inflation figures into account. The market is free, of course, but it cannot be unrestrained. Crowds at the Presidential Mansion– After Karamanlis visited the Presidency last Wednesday, Tasoulas is expecting K.M., who will carry out his monthly briefing to the President of the Republic next Tuesday. And the following day, Wednesday, Tasoulas’s meeting with George Papandreou is scheduled. Tasoulas generally seeks to find a counterbalance to polarization, speaking also with former prime ministers. Contact has already been made with Antonis Samaras and Alexis Tsipras, who in the coming days will finalize their meetings with the President of the Republic. President Maria – Down Town– Over the past weekend, Karystianou’s interview in Down Town magazine, which circulated with Fileleftheros of Cyprus, was widely read; the cover with the retouched photo of the president was commented on, as was her dress, which resembles Versace, etc., for the needs of the photoshoot. To give my opinion: Karystianou entered politics and gives an interview to a lifestyle magazine—it seems logical to me that she would pose, be made up, and dressed for the cover of such a magazine; otherwise she would have gone to speak to the same news outlet (and not its social insert), to another newspaper, or to a website. That is where she wanted to “go” to speak, and that is where she went, and I don’t think she did it unconsciously—her taste, her choice, and whoever wants to judge her may judge her, since, I repeat, the woman entered politics. Tonia’s party, the PASOK people, and the others– If it weren’t for the two cadres from the Androulakis side—Kostas Tsoukalas and Andreas Spyropoulos—it would have looked more like a “pre-conference” of the internal party opponents of President Nikos in the center of Athens. But Tonia Antoniou’s invitation to a well-known bar was for her name day, and so many people from PASOK responded, regardless of their connection to one or another internal faction. Eyewitnesses, however, say that at Tonia’s party, those who supported Androulakis in the internal elections probably did not exceed the fingers of one hand. On the contrary, from early Saturday evening and until well after midnight, dozens of cadres arrived and departed, who are preparing for a hard political arm-wrestling match with the presidential camp at the March Congress. Among the first to arrive were Haris Doukas with his wife Georgia and his close associates Christos Protopapas and Kostas Pantis, as well as Manolis Christodoulakis with several cadres of the “network” that is “warming up” ahead of the Congress. Pavlos Geroulanos was represented at the party by people from his “circle”; Kostas Skandalidis, Odysseas Konstantinopoulos, Nadia Giannakopoulou, and many others (mainly from Southern Athens, where Antoniou will again be a parliamentary candidate) were also there—and drank a glass of wine with her—as were cadres who left PASOK, went to SYRIZA during the Tsipras era, departed, and now seem to be returning, little by little, such as Thanos Moraitis, Zoe Karkoulia, and Panagiotis Kormas. These things happen too… What does not happen, especially at these green gatherings on whatever occasion, is for the conversation to exclude the “jabs” about the unmoving needle, the “stakes” of the Congress, and the bets on the performance of the Karystianou and Tsipras parties. Are they worried? They are more worried about the “nibbling” of voters by Karystianou in every constituency. The Chinese Embassy in Athens… cut the New Year’s cake– For the first time, after many years of presence in Greece, the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Athens decided to… cut a New Year’s cake last Friday! At a time when President Trump is exerting suffocating pressure on Europe with new tariffs, while all European leaders have officially announced visits to Beijing “to strengthen Sino-European political and economic relations,” Ambassador Fang Qiu decided to honor our country’s customs and cut a New Year’s cake. Fang Qiu has never missed an opportunity to speak about the “new era of cooperation between Greece and China,” with an emphasis on trade, Piraeus as a logistics hub, the green transition, and the maritime economy. It came as no surprise that well-known Greek shipowners (Tsakos, Prokopiou, Palios, etc.) and businesspeople honored the event with their presence. The presence of the political leadership was also discreet, with Giorgos Tragakis—who is, after all, president of the Greek-Chinese Friendship Association—the former Minister of Foreign Affairs Dimitris Avramopoulos, and the former President of the Republic Prokopis Pavlopoulos also in attendance. Napalm bombs in Lavrio?– The night before last, a massive fire broke out at liquid fuel storage tanks in Perama, and the authorities fought a huge, almost all-night battle, ultimately managing to extinguish it without any loss of life. All’s well that ends well—these things happen, and often the damage cannot be foreseen. But in the similar case of Lavrio, where an entire, fully operational powder magazine—the tank facilities of Hellenic Defense Systems—has remained active for years, what is happening? What will happen if the EAS tanks, filled with flammable and toxic chemical substances, explode—like napalm bombs—next to residential areas of Lavrio? There, too, as there was with the trains and the fatal Contract 717, as there is at airports with a tender that has been stuck since 2019 (and the FIR blackout occurred a few days ago), there is a tender to clean the Lavrio tanks—and along with it, the risk of the “holocaust” of an entire urban area. But it gets stuck somewhere, like everything else—guess where… It is an issue solely for Dendias, so let him look into it, so we don’t have any dramas. National Bank: Entry into Saudi Arabia and restart of bancassurance– National Bank is moving toward opening up to the markets of the Arab countries and is already running the relevant procedures. In this context, Andreas Kalis from Olayan Financing Company has joined the National Bank team as Chief Executive Officer for the Middle East region. National Bank is opening a Representative Office in Saudi Arabia with a focus on international syndicated loans, advisory services, and investment banking. The bank also appears to be seeking other people in this field, such as a head of syndicated loan origination, given that business opportunities are opening up in the region. As for the other front, that of bancassurance, it is considered almost certain that National Bank will announce—together with its 2025 results, expected at the end of February—its plans in insurance through banks. It is estimated that the announcement will concern NN Hellas in relation to health insurance, as well as a stake in the Greek arm of the multinational, along with another agreement concerning the non-life insurance sector. The bank must set up a rather different mechanism from the one currently existing in its network, because while it had the agreement with Ethniki Asfalistiki, the company had its own network of insurance agents running sales, with the bank playing a supporting role. Now sales will be based on the bank’s branches, which must drive sales themselves—a development that requires different organization, trained staff in branches, and strengthening of electronic sales. Why GEK TERNA is flying– Santander is not Jefferies, nor Wood; that is, it is not a brokerage firm. It is one of the largest European banks and, until now, had never dealt with the Greek stock market. It decided to do so now, with its recent 90-page report on GEK TERNA, which set a target price of €49 and sees the bottom of the stock at €30 and the top at €62. It is strange that Santander did not choose, for its debut in the Greek market, a stock from the MSCI Standard that generates large volumes and is more recognizable to analysts and funds. Even stranger is that so many reports have been issued on Greek stocks by reputable houses, but none so far has created such buying panic. GEK TERNA’s share went from €25.5 to €30 in three sessions, and this happened because there was real and strong buying interest. A professional who sees an opportunity in GEK TERNA and wants to accumulate, say, 2 million shares, breaks the order across different brokerages, sets limits, pauses, rotates the order so that it doesn’t appear there is a buyer, etc. In the case of GEK TERNA, someone—or some people—were buying as if there were no tomorrow, because they obviously consider the stock cheap at €30. Yes, indeed, GEK has the big advantage of concessions. This year we will see Egnatia operating, next year the airport, at the end of ’27–early ’28 the casino, around then the VOAK, etc. It is a business that is maturing and promises significant profits, but there does not seem to be any particular reason for haste for anyone who wants to invest. According to another scenario circulating in the market, it is possible that we will see GEK TERNA in the MSCI Standard in the upcoming review. In short, the column concludes that Santander’s report is probably just the tip of the iceberg, which showed the market that something big is happening at GEK TERNA. What it is, how long it will take to materialize, and similar questions—only G. Peristeris has the answers. Komárek “locked in” the U.S. through PrizePicks– A very important piece of Allwyn’s strategy has fallen into place. Karel Komárek’s group completed the acquisition of PrizePicks, the largest daily fantasy sports platform in the U.S., for $1.53 billion. The acquisition of 62.3% of the American company (the initial agreement was announced in September) creates conditions for faster development of new products, optimization of customer experience through data-driven approaches, and strengthening competitiveness in digital entertainment markets in a huge market such as the U.S., and beyond. The addition of PrizePicks to Allwyn’s portfolio is considered pivotal, as in addition to boosting the group’s figures by approximately €270 million, it allows the group to gain a presence in almost every U.S. state. As for the OPAP–Allwyn merger, it is proceeding according to plan, with the next key date being February 9, when the deadline expires for exercising or not the exit right by shareholders who voted against the proposal at the extraordinary general meeting on January 7. As the deadline approaches, estimates are growing that the percentage of dissenters will decrease, since the offered cash consideration of €19.04 per share is gross; off-market transfer rights and the applicable capital gains tax will be deducted from it, and payment will be made within one month of the entry into force of the cross-border conversion, which is calculated to occur by the end of the second quarter. At the same time, Allwyn continues to buy OPAP shares through the Athens Stock Exchange, although the price has declined significantly, to €17.87. The new… billionaire– He did not make the Forbes list, but the Karelia Tobacco Company deserves a mention, as it has entered the billionaires’ club (with a valuation of €1.004 billion). The share closed at €364, matching the historical record it had set in September 2023. It is noted that in the recent review for free-float adequacy, Karelia was granted an extension of six additional months, i.e. until June 30, to improve its free float. Meetings for figures and plans in London– Piraeus Bank announced its financial calendar for 2026 and specified the date on which it will publish its 2025 results. That date is February 26, and around then similar announcements are expected from the other systemic banks. In addition, one week later—specifically on March 5—it will hold an investor briefing event in London titled Capital Markets Day 2026, where the bank’s new strategic plans will be revealed, including a strong focus on “Ethniki Asfalistiki,” among other things. Piraeus Bank is, of course, not the only bank planning a Capital Markets Day in London. Alpha Bank is planning a similar investor day in the second quarter. DEI’s next move in retail– The DEI Group is currently valued on the Athens Stock Exchange at just over €8.5 billion and, based on management and analyst forecasts, the stock’s P/E ratio, using 2026 earnings, is just above 10. The Stassis management is determined to leverage the retail network it acquired with Kotsovolos and is therefore already in advanced talks for the acquisition of the Amoiridis–Savvidis chain. Market sources report that the price DEI is offering is around €60 million. Just nine months after completing the acquisition of “Kotsovolos” (April 2024, €200 million), DEI wants to complete the picture of its strategy to transform the group into an integrated energy ecosystem. Amoiridis–Savvidis S.A., based in Thessaloniki, is the exclusive distributor of Morris, F&U, United, and Miyato General. For the DEI Group, which already owns 97 Kotsovolos stores in Greece and Cyprus, the addition of Amoiridis brings something different: a strong presence in the B2B channel, a distribution network in regional markets, and expansion into the home appliances sector. The strategy is clear: combining electricity with appliances, cross-selling photovoltaics through stores, and, of course, promoting DEH Smart Home solutions. If the information is confirmed, the DEI Group will be the only utility organization in Greece with full vertical integration in electricals—from the power socket to the appliance plugged into it. The smart game of Greek shipowners and how patience turns into gold– In a shipping market that has long been oscillating between extreme conditions, Greek shipowners are discreetly making their presence felt, while the Korean giant Sinokor Maritime steals the spotlight. Sinokor’s stormy move to sign long-term charter agreements in recent weeks for 14 VLCC supertankers is being presented as a game changer. At the same time, the Greek strategy reveals a parallel reality. Major Greek groups are locking in long-term contracts that secure stable income and, perhaps more importantly, preserve bargaining power in a VLCC market that is suddenly heating up. One need only look at the three-year charter of the Maran Mars (300,000 dwt) of Maria Angelicoussis by Aramco Trading at $52,000 per day. This is a targeted, strategic placement by one of the most historic Greek names, securing steady revenues in a market that is now approaching almost $80,000 per day for modern VLCCs. Evalend Shipping of Kriton Lendoudis has also entered the high-risk game in a strategic way, as information says Trafigura is in the process of buying Evalend’s two VLCCs, Serendipity and Hunter (299,936 and 299,940 dwt respectively, built in 2021), at a fixed price of $125 million each. At the same time, Navios’s five-year charter agreement under Angeliki Frangou with Mitsui OSK Lines for the Nave Allegro at $44,000 per day follows the same playbook: Greek-owned ships deliver steady returns. Spectacular moves like Sinokor dominate the headlines, but the Greeks are playing a different, perhaps smarter game. In an era of extreme volatility, their strategy favors stable returns and negotiating power, while others chase impressions. In the corridors of Wall Street, they would call it risk-adjusted alpha. The background to the attacks on Greek-owned ships– In diplomatic circles, the two recent attacks on Greek-owned ships in the Black Sea are not being treated as simple low-intensity incidents, but as targeted actions with a clear power imprint. The prevailing interpretation is that the targets were not chosen at random. After all, other Greek ships have also been targets of terrorist actions, such as in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. Ships of Greek interests are being selected—that is, ships from a shipping sector that controls approximately 61% of European and 21% of global tonnage. This scale makes Greek-owned shipping a critical link in the global transport chain and, at the same time, an ideal “pressure multiplier.” Behind the scenes, it is estimated that by targeting ships of Greek interests, the aim is to send a message not only to Greece, that the security of maritime trade routes cannot be taken for granted without active political and operational presence. As diplomatic circles point out, attacks of this type have limited military cost but significant political and economic impact. They affect insurance coverage, freight rates, routing choices, and ultimately international energy and trade stability. The same circles note that Greek-owned shipping, because it operates legally and outside sanctions regimes, lends itself to “gray” pressure without immediate international outcry. Athens, according to diplomatic sources, is seeking to use this situation to highlight a long-standing deficit: the absence of a unified maritime security strategy. Contacts at the level of the EU, international organizations, and shipping bodies are no longer limited to recording incidents, but are moving toward joint threat assessment and a possible institutional response. For Greek-owned shipping, what is at stake is not only the safety of its vessels, but its position as a key stabilizing factor in global trade. For this reason, there was an immediate response from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Shipping with meetings to chart a strategy, as well as an intervention by the Union of Greek Shipowners with a statement-message in all directions. Agapitos brings a vessel to the Saronic Gulf– We wrote about it on Friday as information, but over the weekend sources confirmed that Antonis Agapitos is bringing a second high-speed vessel to double up where Speed Cat I operates under the Alpha Lines flag. The name being heard is “ESCHILLO,” and he plans to bring it under tow from Italy. It was built in 2006. As things appear, interesting developments are coming to the Saronic Gulf in the upcoming tourist season. We shall see. New records on the Stock Exchange– In addition to the GEK TERNA record mentioned above, where the stock reached prices not seen since November 1999, the Athens International Airport (AIA) closed at a new all-time high, with the airport’s share consolidating above €11. New records were also achieved by Viohalco and Cenergy, reaching €12.26 and €17 respectively. On the other hand, Jumbo is trading at a nine-month low, with investors still trying to “digest” the reduction in the target price and the downgrade of the recommendation by Citi. Since the American firm’s report was published, the stock has fallen cumulatively by more than 5%, with the €26 support level now being questioned. The unstoppable banks– Banks are posting one of the strongest starts of recent years on the Athens Stock Exchange, having recorded gains of 14.3% in the first ten sessions of 2026. Eurobank is moving at highs of more than ten years, heading full speed toward €4 for the first time since early November 2015. Piraeus Bank broke through the “fortress” of €8 and is trading at levels last seen in March 2021. At the same time, Piraeus Bank became the fourth listed company with an 11-digit valuation, after Coca-Cola HBC, National Bank, and Eurobank, as its market capitalization now approaches €10 billion. How cheap the Athens Stock Exchange is– And since we mentioned the records at the ASE above, worldperatio.com (or World PE Ratio) is a specialized website that tracks and publishes Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios of stock markets worldwide. It evaluates markets across different time frames (5, 10, 20 years) and categorizes them as “Fair,” “Overvalued,” “Expensive,” and “Undervalued.” In the latest table published by worldperatio.com, the New Zealand Stock Exchange flirts with a P/E of 30.04 and the U.S., at 27.07, is characterized as “expensive” across all time horizons. The Greek Stock Exchange, despite five consecutive bullish years, appears impressively cheap on a relative valuation basis. With a capitalization of €154.3 billion and P/E ratios among blue chips below 10, the Greek market is still trading at price levels that would be considered “fair,” even compared with also-labeled “fair” India (P/E 24.11). The Swiss Stock Exchange, with a P/E of 23.62, is considered overvalued on a five-year basis, while Australia, at 21.23, is considered “expensive.” In Greece, the banking sector, with its incredible triple-digit performance, offers ROE above 15%, good dividend yields, and a single-digit P/E of 8. All this in a period of major turbulence, during which all managers wake up and go to sleep with their “finger on the trigger.” After all, today, with Wall Street closed for Martin Luther King Day, it will be seen how European managers view the Athens Stock Exchange. A familiar Portuguese vice president of the ECB– Today’s Eurogroup meeting, under the presidency of Greek Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis, is expected to conclude with the name of the new Vice President of the ECB, as the term of Luis de Guindos expires in May. It appears that the vice presidency of the European Central Bank will not leave the Iberian Peninsula. Among the six candidates (Portugal – Mário Centeno, Latvia – Mārtiņš Kazāks, Estonia – Madis Müller, Finland – Olli Rehn, Lithuania – Rimantas Šadžius, Croatia – Boris Vujčić), information converges that the first, former finance minister and governor of Portugal’s central bank, Mário Centeno, has the greatest chances. The Spaniards hold the presidency of the European Investment Bank (EIB), the French for one more year (until 2027) hold the leadership of the ECB—a position much desired by the Dutch with Klaas Knot and also by the Finns with the—very familiar to us—Olli Rehn. Goldman Sachs arms itself (just in case) with a record issuance– Goldman Sachs is laying its cards on the table with $16 billion. It is preparing to issue the largest bond offering in the history of Wall Street. Officially, Goldman Sachs states that it needs the money for liquidity, refinancing existing debt, and general corporate purposes. On the other hand, it is interesting that the “smartest bank on Wall Street” wants to lock in $16 billion at today’s spread levels and is not waiting for the lower interest rates constantly heralded by the POTUS and his associates. The fact is that bond yields in general are currently at high levels, but the credit spreads of banks with “A investment-grade” ratings remain relatively low. At a time when the Trump administration is announcing “deregulation,” Goldman, under Basel III, faces new capital requirements. For some reason—known only to GS analysts and management—the creation of a $16 billion safety buffer today was preferred over waiting until 2027. There is, of course, also the possibility that Goldman needs $16 billion to enter the dance of mergers and acquisitions. A new face as a candidate for Fed chair– Last Thursday, President Trump welcomed the very well-known BlackRock manager Rick Rieder to the White House. Rieder is Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock and manages approximately $2.4 trillion in assets. After the White House meeting, it was revealed that RR is one of the four candidates on the final shortlist for the position of Chair of the Federal Reserve, as Jerome Powell’s term ends on May 15, 2025. Also present at Thursday’s meeting were Susie Wiles (chief of staff), Scott Bessent (Secretary of the Treasury), and Dan Scavino (deputy chief of staff). The fact that Trump is considering a top Wall Street executive—from the world’s largest asset management firm—for the leadership of the Fed has once again unsettled New York, which always has as a favorite topic of discussion—how to put it politely—the potential convergence between market interests and the monetary policy the Fed will follow after May.

PHOTO: SUNWAY/FACEBOOK Published Jan 19, 2026, 10:28 AM Updated Jan 19, 2026, 07:11 PM KUALA LUMPUR - Sunway’s proposed RM11 billion (S$3.5 billion) takeover of IJM Corp is drawing political scrutiny over concerns that it could dilute both the equity interests of the government and the rights of Malaysia’s bumiputeras. Dr Akmal Saleh, the youth chief of UMNO, which is a key member of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s ruling coalition, raised concerns over the deal in a Facebook post on Jan 18. The Malay Businessmen and Industrialists Association of Malaysia is also questioning the deal, according to a separate report in Free Malaysia Today. The deal could help Sunway emerge as the largest property and construction conglomerate in Malaysia, UOB Kay Hian has written in a note. But Sunway is largely controlled by Malaysian tycoon Jeffrey Cheah Fook Ling, who is ethnic Chinese, and the criticism underscores the sensitivity of any deal that may affect the interests of bumiputeras, a term that refers to Malays and various indigenous groups. Dr Akmal said bumiputera stakes in major Malaysian corporates are “already limited” and that the deal would reduce that interest if it goes through. He noted that various Malaysian state funds, including Permodalan Nasional and the Employees Provident Fund, which are widely held by bumiputera interests, own a combined 47.1 per cent stake in IJM. Malay Businessmen and Industrialists Association president Azamanizam Baharon urged Datuk Seri Anwar to intervene over what he called a historic policy mistake, according to the Free Malaysia report on Jan 18. Sunway could not immediately be reached for comment. The country’s sovereign fund, Khazanah Nasional, also faced political criticism when it privatised Malaysia Airports Holdings in an equally large privatisation exercise in 2024. That was largely owing to the involvement of BlackRock, whose perceived ties to Israel were unpopular in a Muslim-majority country where pro-Palestine sentiments run high. The Khazanah transaction faced delays as a result, but was finally completed in early 2025. BLOOMBERG E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Title: Fed chair race still up in the air

White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said President Donald Trump may well keep him in his current job, which would eliminate him from contention for the next Federal Reserve chair. “From the beginning, he and I have talked about whether it’s better for me to be here in the West Wing or over at the Fed,” Hassett said on Fox News’ “The Sunday Briefing.” “I don’t think he’s made a final call on that.” Trump expressed reluctance last week about nominating Hassett as the successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, telling the National Economic Council director during a White House event that “I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth.” Hassett once was considered the front-runner, along with Fed Governor Christopher Waller, former governor Kevin Warsh and BlackRock Inc. executive Rick Rieder. It’s now seen as a four-man race, while Rieder’s candidacy has recently gained late momentum, according to people familiar with the matter, as some view him as potentially better placed to win U.S. Senate confirmation. A criminal probe targeting the Federal Reserve and Powell over the remodeling of the central bank’s headquarters injected a new element into the Fed search and sparked a wave of backlash. Powell accused the Justice Department of opening the investigation to pressure the central bank into cutting rates. Key lawmakers, including Senate Banking Committee member Thom Tillis, warned that Trump’s nominees will be scrutinized more closely. Coupled with Trump’s relentless pressure on Powell and the Fed to lower interest rates, the DOJ’s move renewed a broader market focus on the central bank’s autonomy from political interference, though Trump said “I don’t know anything” about the probe. Axios reported on Jan. 12 that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Trump the investigation had created a mess and could be bad for financial markets. While Bessent declined to comment on the Axios report on NBC’s Meet the Press, he cited Treasury bond auctions last week as evidence that “the market is looking beyond this.” Bond yields fell Tuesday and Wednesday, though the Treasury market was relatively little changed last week. Bessent told NBC he isn’t concerned that the Senate could block Trump’s eventual nominee to helm the Fed. “I think we will move forward,” he said. “I believe that we will probably be hearing from the Banking Committee soon on what they would like to see.” Jerome Powell’s term as head of the central bank ends on May 15. The search process is being led by Bessent, who Trump has said removed himself from consideration for the role. “There are a lot of great candidates, and it could well be that the president’s right to make the decision that this is the best place for me right now,” Hassett said Sunday, referring to the White House.

Title: What Do Costco Price Tag Codes Really Mean?

Time Published: 2026-01-18T22:17:00Z

If you shop at Costco, you may notice that price tags sometimes look different. Some end in $.99 and others in $.97, for example. Then there's the "death star" asterisk that means low inventory and likely end of run. When you understand the numbers, dates, and symbols, it can help you shop better, save money, and get items not only before they're gone, but at the best price possible. Costco sometimes brings items in seasonally or to test them. Some stay stocked long term while others are only available for a limited time. At Costco, you can't always see something and decide to come back and buy it later. If you love something and it's a good deal, you may want to get it now before it's gone. Knowing the tricks of the trade will help you get the most out of your Costco membership. Many members follow deals posted in local Costco groups on sites like Facebook and by popular content creators. But understanding Costco pricing patterns puts you on another level. The superstore uses the same price codes in both the U.S. and Canada, so if you're from one country and shopping in the other, the same conventions ring true, too. Here's how to decipher Costco's price tag codes. The two numbers that represent cents at the end of a Costco item price have more meaning than you might think. If the price of an item ends in $.99, this means it's being offered at full price. It's still typically a great deal since you're buying in bulk, but it's the original price Costco offers on this item with no additional markdowns, unless you see additional instant savings. If an item is marked with $.97 at the end, this means it's a clearance item or the manager of that location has manually marked it down. This is usually specific to the location, so while you might see this price in your local Costco, a friend who lives in another city may not see it in theirs. It usually means the price isn't going to go any lower, so if it's something you have been eyeing, grab it now. Sometimes, this marking will appear in pen over a crossed-out original price, so it's easy to tell that it's a further markdown. With plenty of Costco electronics worth buying along with lots of other items for smart homeowners, you'll want to take advantage of these $.97 deals. You may occasionally notice product marked in $.00 or $.88. This could mean one of a few things. It could be that the store is running low on inventory for this item, and the manager is clearing out the remaining stock. It could also mean that it's a returned item, it may have damage, be open-box, or it's missing parts. It could also be a discounted floor model. Your best bet in this case is to ask a manager on duty for more specific details. Some items may end in a "9" but have another number before it, like "$12.89" or "$22.59." If you spot one of these, it usually means there is a promotional deal being offered directly from the manufacturer as a test for pricing adjustments and placement. This is typically done for limited sales periods. If it's something like coffee beans or toilet paper that you know you'll use and has a long shelf life, stocking up when you see these deals can save you a lot in the long run. The same goes for some of the best Costco electronics. But you may also want to wait for potential deeper discounts when Costco holds its own manager discounts. Along with different pricing conventions, you might notice symbols on price placards for all types of items, like DIY gadgets at Costco, which have meaning, too. Known as the "death star" for a product, when you see an asterisk, this means the item likely won't be restocked once the current inventory depletes. It's either discontinued, seasonal, or isn't selling well, and it probably won't be returning, at least not for a long time if at all. This could also designate a simple SKU or packaging change, so check with a manager to clarify so you don't miss out. Price signs often have dates underneath the cost as well. This informs the last time the price changed for that item. Based on this date, you can theorize about when the item might go down again in price, or if it seems like something that goes on seasonal sales, for example. Costco rotates deals so if the date is at least a few weeks ago, you might want to wait to see if the item goes on sale again. If there's no asterisk on the tag, this means there's plenty of stock, and chances are, it might drop even lower in price. One other detail to note about Costco price tags is that if it's green, the product is organic. Note that not everything that's organic at Costco will have the green price tag, so you should still read labels. But everything that has a green price tag is organic. Overall, look or the prices that end in $.97 for the best deals. Pricing that ends in $.88 or $.00 are good deals, too, that could be specific to your location. Manufacturer discounts that end in a $.X9 could be decent, but chances are if the item stays, you'll get a better deal down the road. That one's a toss-up judgement call you'll have to make. If you see an asterisk, get the item now, maybe even stock up with more than you need if it isn't perishable because it will likely be gone soon. Following these tips, you can save even more at Costco, won't miss out on the best deals and limited inventory items, and have plenty left over for the always $1.50 hot dog to satiate your hunger after a long shopping session.

Title: BlackRock’s Rick Rieder bid for Fed chair is gaining traction
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/18/blackrock-rick-rieder-bid-fed-chair-trump-jerome-powell-hassett/
Time Published: 2026-01-18T19:02:46Z
Full Content:
The candidacy of BlackRock’s Rick Rieder to be the next Federal Reserve chair has gained late momentum, people familiar with the matter say, as President Donald Trump weighs congressional blowback in his bid to put a friendlier face at the head of the central bank. Trump’s interview Thursday with Rieder went well, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. Key senators such as Republican Banking Committee member Thom Tillis have warned that Trump’s Fed picks will get more scrutiny after the Justice Department subpoenaed the Fed last week over statements by Chair Jerome Powell related to a renovation project at the bank’s headquarters. But Powell, whose term expires in May, contends the criminal probe is a pretext to punish him for not cutting rates quickly enough. Read More: Fed Served With DOJ Subpoenas; Powell Vows to Stand Firm Trump, asked Friday about the selection process, said he had a candidate in mind, while declining to name him. “I think I have it — in my mind, done,” he said. The search is now a four-man race, some of the people said, among Rieder, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and former governor Kevin Warsh, the people said. Read More: The Turbulent Forces Reshaping The Fed This Year Hassett was an early frontrunner and continued to be until Trump said this week he may not want to lose Hassett from his current role. It’s not clear if it was a signal of a shifting internal deliberation, or an offhand remark. “Nobody knows who President Trump will choose for the Fed, except President Trump himself. As the president recently said, he will announce his final decision soon,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a written statement Saturday. The decision to subpoena the Fed a week ago sparked a wave of backlash, including a pledge by Tillis — who sits on the committee that would first consider a nominee — to oppose any Fed nomination until the matter is resolved. Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, is viewed as potentially easier to confirm, some of the people said. A spokesperson for BlackRock declined to comment on Rieder’s status. Hiring data released earlier this month suggested the labor market remained fragile at the end of the year, and the outlook for hiring is guarded. Economists see another year of limited job opportunities and cooling pay gains, likely exacerbating voters’ affordability concerns going into this year’s midterm elections. Fed officials cut rates three consecutive times at the end of 2025, but have signaled they’re in no rush to lower them again until they see more data on inflation and the labor market. Policymakers are expected to hold rates steady at their next meeting on Jan. 27-28. Rieder has called the Fed’s independence “critical,” but has also echoed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in saying the central bank could be more “innovative” in how it uses its balance sheet.

Title: The world's rich and powerful are descending on Davos — and many are coming by private jet
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/davos-private-jets-rich-powerful-arrive-tracker-2026-1
Time Published: 2026-01-18T15:17:49Z

Private jets are descending on the typically quiet ski town of Davos as the masters of the universe make their way to Switzerland for the World Economic Forum. Bill Gates, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon are among the business leaders scheduled to attend, along with world leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron, Argentina's Javier Milei, and Donald Trump. It's unlikely any of these titans will fly commercial. Last year, private aviation traffic in the region during WEF week was about five times the usual level, with more than 150 jets landing at area airports, according to JetSpy, which tracks FAA-registered aircraft. They were registered to billionaires like Michael Dell and Robert Smith, and hailed from Palm Beach and Dubai, Paris, and Doha. This weekend, corporate jets owned by Google, BlackRock, and IBM were among those that arrived in the area, according to data from JetSpy. Few WEF attendees will fly into Engadin Airport, the airport closest to Davos and the highest in Europe by altitude. "For many years, the WEF week has actually been one of the quietest weeks of the winter season for us," Christian Gorfer, the airport's chief financial officer, told Business Insider in an email. Due to airspace restrictions within a 25 nautical mile radius of Davos, all flights to and from Engadin require prior authorisation from the Swiss Air Force. "Some of our regular customers do fly in and out during that week, but WEF participants generally do not make their way to [Engadin]," Gorfer said. Instead, many private jets and government airplanes will arrive at the Zurich Airport alongside regular airlines. It's about a two-hour drive away from the Alpine town, but the wealthiest people will travel by helicopter instead. The airport estimated there will be an extra 1,000 takeoffs and landings during the conference, with some landing after its typically strict curfew of 11:30 p.m. Zurich Airport is also extending the opening hours for an observation deck for planespotters and other aviation enthusiasts. Others fly into Germany's Friedrichshafen Airport, a Jetspy spokesperson told Business Insider. The jets will be a parade of some of the most expensive on the market. Many opt for the Gulfstream G650, which costs tens of millions and was the transport of choice for attendees like Gates, Louis Bacon, and executives from BlackRock and Goldman Sachs last year. Others fly on the Bombardier Global 7500, which has been dubbed the "Ferrari of the Skies." Jump to

Title: The Panama Canal proves one lesson America needs now: never quit

Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins unpacks which nations have control of the Panama Canal on ‘Special Report.’ I grew up in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. Our town’s name described what made us unique — we had locks on the Connecticut River. Ever since I was a kid, I have understood how locks worked, and I always wanted to see the ones that changed the world. Recently, I had that opportunity when I transited the Panama Canal. To see the locks operate just as they have for more than 110 years was thrilling. Traveling the almost 50-mile journey from the Pacific to the Atlantic was an experience I’ll never forget. The construction of the canal was the largest and most expensive project ever undertaken at that point in human history. Nothing so massive, elaborate or systematic had ever been attempted before. The financial cost, combined with the human toll of more than 25,000 lives lost, was comparable to a war. BLACKROCK INKS $23B DEAL FOR PANAMA CANAL PORTS Such a monumental achievement could never have happened without determination, perseverance, persistence and grit. The result changed the world and the global economy forever. The canal cut the distance from the Atlantic to the Pacific by 8,000 miles, resulting in three fewer weeks of travel time. Today, ships carrying as many as 11,000 containers transit through the canal. Cars, appliances and an array of other goods make their way across the world thanks to the more than 13,000 to 14,000 ships that use the Panama Canal each year. But the journey to a mid-continental canal was a long one, filled with crushed dreams, financial ruin, enormous adversity — and ultimate triumph. The French were the first to attempt building the canal. Ferdinand de Lesseps had built the Suez Canal and was certain he could build the Panama Canal too. The French created a private company to do it. They sold shares in multiple rounds of investment. Huge sums of money were raised and spent. After almost a decade of work, they quit and accepted defeat. Ferdinand de Lesseps insisted on a sea-level canal instead of one with locks, even though the two oceans have different sea levels, with tides rising 20 feet on the Pacific side but only three feet on the Atlantic. That decision was the single greatest factor in the project’s failure. BUILDING THE PANAMA CANAL: HOW TEDDY ROOSEVELT’S ALL-AMERICAN VISION MADE HISTORY More than 20,000 workers died, most from yellow fever and malaria. He would later admit that Panama was 10 times more difficult than Suez. Most unfortunate were the more than 800,000 French men and women who had invested in the project. The savings of entire families were gone. People lost everything. It was the largest and most significant financial collapse on record — a historic failure. Panama Canal lock's gates opening. (Danuta Hamlin) A decade later, America chose to build the Panama Canal. President Theodore Roosevelt asked the U.S. Senate to choose either Panama or Nicaragua for the canal. Even though a Nicaragua canal would be 135 miles longer, require more locks, and be more expensive to operate, it was the favorite. But after 14 days of debate, Panama won by a mere eight votes. America would pursue the seemingly impossible task of building the Panama Canal. It would require cutting through a jungle filled with ferocious animals, snakes and tarantulas — and carving through the sheer rock of the Continental Divide. US, PANAMA ‘TAKING BACK’ CANAL FROM ‘CHINA'S INFLUENCE,’ SAYS HEGSETH Roosevelt tapped John Wallace as chief engineer. He lasted only a year, overwhelmed by the monumental task, a brutal climate and the fear of yellow fever and malaria. John Stevens took over and proposed a lake-and-lock plan. The Panama Canal is not a simple passageway. It uses three locks to lift ships up to travel through the man-made Gatun Lake, then three more locks to lower them back down to another canal. Stevens also tasked chief Army physician William Gorgas with successfully eradicating yellow fever. But Stevens resigned three years later with no explanation. A cargo ship traverses the Agua Clara Locks of the Panama Canal in Colon, Panama, Sept. 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Matias Delacroix, File) Col. George Goethals took over and finished the job. He brought a military mindset to the work, but the demanding conditions remained. The rainy season lasts eight months in Panama, with 120 inches of annual rainfall, resulting in flooding and mudslides. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Heat and humidity were oppressive. At the bottom of Culebra Cut, the midday temperature was seldom less than 100 degrees — and often reached 120 to 130 degrees. On a typical day, more than 300 rock drills were in use, along with steam shovels and dynamite blasts. The noise was deafening and could be heard for miles. Though yellow fever and malaria were eradicated, death was omnipresent. Men were struck by flying rocks, crushed by machines or blown to bits by dynamite. More than 5,000 men died during the American construction. It was an incredible test of human endurance. But on Aug. 15, 1914, the canal opened for business — miraculously under budget and six months ahead of schedule. It was the culmination of a dream and more than 20 years of phenomenal effort and perseverance. This new year, you can see the impossible become possible in your own life — if you practice the same persistence and determination. As the English preacher Charles Spurgeon once said, "By persistence the snail reached the ark." ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ON NEW YEAR'S DAY, SHARES 'THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS' WHEN IT COMES TO ACHIEVING GOALS This could be the year you stick with it — no more quitting or giving up. No more excuses for why it can’t be done or is simply too difficult. The canal went from a dream to reality through grit and determination, through consistent progress in a singular direction. Panama Canal locks. (Danuta Hamlin) Maybe you are disappointed with the pace of your progress or the rate of your accomplishments. You may wish you were further along than you are. It takes time for the work to be done in our lives. It often takes longer than we expect. We can get frustrated at the slow pace of growth and wish for more. But if you have perseverance and endurance, you can see your dream become reality. You may lack money, ability or resources, but a million dollars’ worth of determination will get it done. There may be setbacks this year. Illness strikes. Loss hits. Relationships end. Time and again, in the building of the canal, there were setbacks that required restructuring. You, too, must regroup and continue your journey. Despite the failures, you must choose to persevere through disappointment and pain. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP You can hang on far longer than you think. You may believe you can’t do it anymore. It’s hard. It’s challenging. But so was building the canal — and they overcame. You can too. Sometimes the toughest moment comes right before the breakthrough.

According to the World Economic Forum’s Report released January 2026, the upcoming meeting on the 18th will highlight instability via: Geoeconomic confrontation, state-based armed conflict, extreme weather events, and societal polarization. Economic risks are intensifying and will do so over the next two to ten years. In contrast to White House disinformation, an economic downturn and inflation are top tier. “An economic reckoning explores how, over the next two years, mounting debt sustainability concerns coupled with potential economic bubbles – in a context of rising Geoeconomic confrontation – could herald a new phase of volatility, potentially further destabilizing societies and businesses.” The Ten-Year outlook focuses on extreme weather events, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, critical change to earth systems.

Geoeconomic confrontation involves such actions as tariffs, sanctions, weaponization against economic rivals as the triggers which could collapse society. Societal polarization refers to distrust in institutions, extreme societal division, and divergent sets of ‘facts’. Extreme weather could be the result of weather manipulation wherein natural systems are broken down causing extremes. However, the run of magnetic north southward is definitely in play as a natural event. Oddly, Trump is accelerating all the two- and ten-year events with instructions from the Deep State Kabbalah. How will he address these at a podium in Davos will be an interesting insight into the who, what, where and how. The latest addition to ‘mounting debt’ is Trump offering Greenland $700 billion. Without authorization of the Congress, or The People. Unconstitutional. According to Debt Clock, the countries with the lowest debt to GDP include: Russia, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Turkey. All within the Eastern Hemisphere. When realizing and analyzing the global actions, the World Economic Forum Agenda, the Trump effect, the overriding question is “WHY?” We are all privy to the reality that this is all contrived. It is not coincidental. Not evolutionary. It is a created failure of the American empire, which will ripple through global economies like a ball barring hitting the Empire State Building! The ’why’ is almost as obscure as asking why don’t humans see the entire color spectrum? Why would God limit our sight and hearing? Why do we exist? Why doesn’t ANY government acknowledge UFO’s? They have been around for thousands of years. Depicted in cave art, the Minoan culture, the Aztecs, etc. In order to know and understand the WHY of the Kabbalah’s design of destruction, we would have to understand their souls, their hearts, their minds – which would likely drive a sane man to insanity. To know them, one would have to become like them. And it appears, Trump has always been a deceiver. JD Vance is considered par to worse than Trump. Graham is their openly evil jester. He speaks what they don’t say and jumps for joy at any chance to murder large swathes of humans. To understand – would mean to be like Graham. Under co-chairs Larry Fink (BlackRock) and Andre Hoffman (la Roche), the World Economic Forum has expanded quite exponentially adding 11 distinct ‘Centres’ to its foray into world domination. These Centres would operate as agencies within the context of the sphere and include cybersecurity, AI, manufacturing, energy, tech, financial & monetary, trade and the crème de la crème – Centre for The New Economy and Society! It is billed as a platform for leaders to build prosperous, resilient and inclusive societies that create opportunities for all. Heavily weighted companies associated with this Centre include the US, UAE, Netherlands, India and the UK. See this. In order to build anew, one must first destroy the entirety of the old. Much like razing Gaza but on a global level. It means a hell of a lot of people will die in order to rearrange the deck chairs. It reads like a blueprint of a monarchy. The leaders and stakeholders will need to assure a viable talented working class to create and build these initiatives because bankers and politicians don’t have skillsets. As such, they are more than willing to task education facilities to ‘re-skill via the “Revolution initiative.” In 1976, the movie Logan’s Run revealed such a society whereby productivity was considered to decline as of the age of 30 – therefore everyone attaining the age of 30 must commit their duty to be gassed – voluntarily. I see this sort of energy in the WEF’s new website Initiative for the New Economy and Society. This will be accomplished thru the Initiative — The Global Gender Parity Sprint. Without this initiative, it will take 123 years to close the gender gap. Acceleration is necessary. The means? * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

U.S. President Donald Trump will attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland, this week as he continues to challenge the established world order with a series of geopolitical victories and the promise of more to come. Since returning to the White House the president has withdrawn from numerous wasteful and unaccountable international organizations, including the U.N. climate treaty, captured Venezuela’s socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro following an attack on the capital Caracas and is now looking to annex Greenland. He has also challenged members of the NATO alliance to step up and start paying their way without relying so much on U.S. taxpayer dollars. Trump will be joined this year by more than 60 heads of state and government at the snowy confab of corporate and cultural elites. Among them are Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Argentinian President Javier Milei, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa. DW reports Trump is leading the largest U.S. delegation ever to Davos, comprising five cabinet secretaries and other senior officials. Final preparations are underway in Davos as the town gets ready to welcome guests for the World Economic Forum on January 17, 2026 in Switzerland. The annual meeting brings together leaders from government, business and civil society to discuss major global issues. (Elena Romanova/Getty) The delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve ​Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, setting the stage for high-profile discussions on Ukraine, Venezuela, Gaza and Iran, where eyewitnesses have reported a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests, DW notes before continuing: Trump is expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Kyiv’s G7 allies — including leaders from Germany, Italy, France, the UK, Canada and the European Commission president — on the sidelines of the main event to seek US backing for security guarantees for Ukraine after a possible peace agreement with Russia, the Financial Times reported. The strong U.S. presence would be complemented by the first-ever “USA House” — a venue housed in a small church on the town’s main Promenade street, where US officials will host events and network with investors. Added to the list is California Governor Gavin Newsom, a determined Trump foe slated to speak one day after the president’s address. “Trump’s economic agenda betrays our nation: it is not ‘America First’ but ‘Trump First’ — rewarding the favored, punishing the dissenters, and burdening the rest,” Newsom said in a statement as reported by Politico. “At the World Economic Forum, I will forcefully confront these abuses and resolutely defend the principles to which California owes its economic strength: disciplined governance, world-leading universities, boundless innovation, and an open embrace of global cultures. This year’s meeting would be the first without WEF founder Klaus Schwab at the helm after he stepped down last year. Schwab has been succeeded by interim co-chairs Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, and Andre Hoffmann, vice chair of Swiss pharmaceuticals company Roche Holdings. President Trump will front the gathering in person on Wednesday after last year making his address remotely via via videostream. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: More than 600 gardaí injured in line of duty last year
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2026/0118/1553724-garda-injuries/
Time Published: 2026-01-18T12:01:21Z
Full Content:
More than 600 gardaí were injured in the line of duty last year with more than half sustaining an injury as a result of an assault. New figures released under Freedom of Information legislation show that the number of gardaí injured at work during 2025 rose by 11% compared to the previous year. A total of 616 officers were recorded reporting some form of work-related injury last year - up from 555 in 2024. The figures include 344 gardaí who sustained injuries as the result of an assault - 56% of all injuries incurred in the line of duty. Among high-profile incidents in which gardaí were assaulted during the year were riots outside the Citywest complex in Saggart, Co Dublin in October as well as three separate incidents over a weekend in Dungarvan, Co Waterford in the same month when seven gardaí were injured. The second most common source of injury for gardaí in 2025 after assault were injuries from slips, trips and/or falls which resulted in injuries to 87 officers, followed by road traffic collisions which injured 78 gardaí. The figures show 41 gardaí suffered injuries like sprains or broken bones as a result of what is classified as "body movement", while 17 gardaí were injured from some form of contact with an animal including dog bites. Another 24 were injured from contact with something either sharp, rough or pointed and another ten suffered either a needle stick injury, a stab wound or exposure to a body fluid. The figures also reveal that 16 gardaí sustained injuries while based at the Garda College in Templemore, Co Tipperary, with approximately two-thirds of incidents at the training facility associated with slips, trips or falls. Another 15 injuries were reported among staff working at Garda HQ in Phoenix Park in Dublin. A total of eight members of the Garda Special Tactics and Operations Command were injured during 2025 including three who were assaulted. The overall level of injuries equates to around 4% of the 14,200-plus available force suffering some type of harm in the course of their work in 2025 – or one in every 25 gardaí. However, the rate can vary significantly around the country with 7% of gardaí in three garda divisions - Galway, Kerry and Wexford/Wicklow - being injured at work last year. The most number of gardaí injured in the line of duty in any of the 21 garda divisions last year was Galway with 43 out of a total workforce of 616, including 36 members who were assaulted. In contrast, the injury rate was as low as 2% in the Dublin East region, which covers areas including Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire and Dundrum, where just seven out of 377 gardaí reported a work-related injury. The Kerry division with a smaller workforce of 348 recorded more than three times that number with 25 officers being injured on duty - although the figure was a decrease on the 41 gardaí injured in Kerry in 2024. On taking up his appointment last September, Garda Commissioner Justin Kelly said the safety of gardaí was "of utmost importance and concern" for An Garda Síochána. Mr Kelly subsequently authorised the introduction of tasers for frontline gardaí on a pilot basis while the wearing of body cameras is to be unrolled nationwide among frontline staff too as measures aimed at reducing the level of injuries to gardaí. In November 2023, the government increased the maximum sentence for assaulting or threatening to assault a garda or any other on-duty emergency worker from seven to 12 years. © RTÉ 2026.

Title: Climate funding: Why PSUs are stepping in where VCs fear to tread

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. New Delhi: Neiox Eco Cycle isn’t the sort of startup you read about every day. It isn’t solving for fashion, food or grocery delivery. Rather, it is in the business of ship hulls—specifically, it is developing carbon-negative, non-toxic marine coatings for the undersides of marine vessels. There is nothing sexy about the business, which has to solve for plankton, barnacles, mussels and other such delights. It’s also not the sort of business that attracts much interest from venture capitalists (VCs), who generally prefer to focus on consumer-facing or software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses. Despite this, Neiox Eco Cycle, founded by Akhil Raj Pottekkat, was able to obtain a tiny amount of funding in November 2024. The money didn’t come from a VC, but from Cochin Shipyard, which invested ₹30 lakh in the Kerala-based climate-tech startup. Last October, the shipbuilder followed that up with an additional ₹75 lakh investment under its maritime innovation programme. Neiox isn’t the only startup to receive backing from an unlikely investor. In November, Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL) invested ₹120 crore in Bengaluru-based electric vehicle (EV) startup 3ev, which builds electric cargo vehicles and battery infrastructure, for a 30.97% stake. That same month, Varaha, a climate-tech startup, received an infusion of $30.5 million from Mirova, the sustainable investing arm of French financial group Natixis. Other examples include Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) backing early-stage climate technologies through its Udgam innovation platform, including a ₹35-crore investment in Maraal Aerospace, which builds long-range solar-powered drones, and Oil India Ltd backing carbon and materials innovation through investments in startups such as Caliche and Carbonation India in 2025. These investments may appear disparate and unrelated on the surface. But together, they epitomize a gradual shift in how climate innovation is being funded, driven less by rapid exits and more by patient capital. India’s climate-tech story is increasingly being written by these unlikely financiers—legacy institutions, public sector firms and global capital are stepping in where venture capital has feared to tread. To be sure, these are mostly very small investments. But, like a mustard seed, the investors hope, these infusions, made with an eye on the future, will germinate into something huge. Rather than near-term returns, they are hedging against regulatory risk, future demand shifts and operational disruptions. “The traditional VC model is built for high-risk, hyper-growth businesses, while most climate technologies require patient capital and long gestation periods. That mismatch is why legacy firms, public sector undertakings (PSUs) and global investors are stepping in—they’re investing to hedge transition risk and build relevance, not to chase fast exits," said Rajan Mehta, founder, Climate Ventures Partner. This quiet realignment is unfolding against a paradoxical backdrop. India has seen 642 climate-tech startups founded in the last three years, and 492 have raised funding over that period. Yet only 61 have reached Series B or later, while 678 have shut shop since January 2023, according to data from Tracxn. What lies beneathIn shipping, what keeps a vessel afloat and profitable is often what lies unseen beneath the waterline. The hull—the lower portion of a vessel, which remains submerged—is its most critical and vulnerable component. Constant exposure to seawater and microscopic marine organisms make it prone to corrosion. Unlike engines or other mechanical systems that are routinely overhauled, hull quality largely determines a ship’s long-term value. Vessels are typically taken out of service every five years for dry docking, where hulls are inspected, repaired and repainted. View Full Image Globally, the shipping sector has pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by around 2050. Current systems require the application of multiple layers—often as many as seven—with separate coatings used to prevent corrosion and to reduce biofouling (accumulation of biowaste such as barnacles on the hull). The accumulation of marine organisms on a ship’s hull increases drag, forcing vessels to burn more fuel to maintain speed, increasing emissions—most vessels still run on highly polluting fuels derived from crude oil. Existing anti-fouling paints by and large rely on biocides that kill marine organisms—an approach increasingly being frowned on by European environmental rules. For shipbuilders and repair yards, coatings are thus an unglamorous but decisive variable, shaping operating economics and emissions over decades. For ship owners, every day that a vessel sits in dock translates into idle time and lost revenue. Globally, marine hull coatings are dominated by a small club of companies such as Jotun, Hempel and Nippon Paint. These multinationals control licensing, class approvals and defence-grade specifications. While some manufacture in India, there is no Indian-origin company with an internationally approved marine coating. That gap is what drew Cochin Shipyard, India’s largest state-run shipbuilder, to back Neiox Eco Cycle. The startup upcycles industrial air pollutants into an advanced additive that can be integrated into marine paint and applied directly to ship hulls. It thus turns waste into a functional input for one of shipping’s most consequential, if least visible, layers, said Neiox’s Pottekkat. View Full Image Akhil Raj Pottekkat, founder, Neiox Eco Cycle. Neiox is positioning itself not just as a domestic alternative, but as a regulation-compliant challenger offering non-toxic, carbon-negative coatings. The company claims its technology collapses the seven-layer coating stack into a single, non-toxic application that tackles both corrosion and biofouling—cutting downtime, fuel loss and environmental risk in one stroke. For Cochin Shipyard, it checks several boxes at once. “Risk-adjusted technology exposure is often the priority (for investors such as Cochin Shipyard): small grants help create an early pipeline of tested solutions that could become relevant to future operations without committing large balance-sheet capital upfront," said Sumanta Biswas, assistant director at CUTS International, a policy research and advocacy group. Compliance with green norms is another imperative for Cochin Shipyard. Globally, the shipping sector has pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by around 2050 under a revised strategy adopted by the International Maritime Organization, with interim emissions reduction targets set for 2030 and 2040. Beyond gasIn Mumbai, MGL, a stodgy, listed city gas utility. was led by the same rationale to invest in 3ev. The startup offers aftermarket services such as battery-as-a-service (BaaS), where it plans to deploy a bulk of the ₹120 crore funding from MGL, given that batteries are the most critical and fastest-degrading component in commercial EVs, making uptime, replacement and life-cycle management central to fleet economics. During its earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025-26, MGL’s management struck a careful tone: EVs, it said, are unlikely to dent compressed natural gas (CNG) demand in the near term. Yet, in the same breath, the company acknowledged investments such as 3ev as part of exploring adjacent energy transition opportunities, describing it as a long-term equity bet with limited near-term financial impact. “Mahanagar Gas’s management was actively analysing the transition to electric mobility—what it would mean for gas distribution, transportation demand… It wasn’t just an internal discussion; investors and analysts were asking the same questions," said Peter Voelkner, managing director of 3ev. View Full Image Peter Voelkner, managing director, 3ev. The move marks MGL’s first meaningful step into EV operations, though the company had earlier dipped its toe into e-mobility, including EV charging infrastructure, in collaboration with Tata Power in 2019. More recently, MGL acquired a 44% equity stake in International Battery Company India last February. “MGL’s earlier engagement with Tata Power in 2019 on EV charging infrastructure was part of nascent sector exploration. Its lead investment in 3ev represents a meaningful escalation, transitioning from collaborative pilots to capital commitments in core EV value-chain companies," said Biswas. 3ev is currently piggybacking on MGL’s footprint in Mumbai, with pilot projects placing fast-charging infrastructure at the utility’s CNG filling stations. Beyond Mumbai, the company operates independently in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Coimbatore. The green imperativeIf utilities and shipyards are making cautious, balance-sheet-light bets, global climate capital is moving with a different calculus. International investors and corporates, less constrained by domestic exit timelines, are increasingly backing Indian climate startups tackling longer-cycle problems such as carbon sequestration and regenerative agriculture—areas where traditional venture capital has been slow to commit. While Varaha is one example, other Indian climate-tech startups have also benefited. Arya.ag, which builds farm-gate infrastructure to reduce post-harvest losses, recently raised ₹725 crore in a Series D round led by GEF Capital Partners, a global private equity firm. “Global investors are greening their portfolios. Supporting climate projects in India helps them meet sustainability targets while accessing long-term growth," said Pradeep Singhvi, executive director, energy and climate practice, Grant Thornton Bharat, a management consultancy. Varaha’s model is simple: balance long-cycle carbon bets with faster climate and commercial returns. Flush with more than $42 million in funding, the startup last year struck a deal with Google, which agreed to purchase 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide removal credits from the Indian startup. A carbon removal agreement, or carbon purchase agreement (CPA), is a contract by which a company such as Google commits to buying future carbon dioxide removal credits from a supplier such as Varaha. It marked Google’s first carbon-removal agreement tied to a project in India and the largest involving biomass-based biochar—often dubbed “black gold" for soils. Varaha has since followed this up with another agreement with Microsoft last week, making it the tech company’s first carbon removal purchase in Asia. With biochar credits typically priced between $150 and $160 per tonne, a back-of-the-envelope calculation values these deals at roughly $16 million. So far, the New Delhi-based startup is the only Indian company to be listed on carbon removal standard and registry Puro.Earth. Prior to the recent infusion by Mirova, it had received funding from RTP Global, Japan’s Norinchukin Bank, Omnivore and Orios Venture Partners. Yet, interest from venture capital remains thin. Most climate-tech startups that have raised funding in India fall into adaptation-focused products—areas with clearer customers, shorter payback cycles and easier monetisation. Scale remains elusive across much of climate tech. There are around 800 viable climate-tech startups in India, but less than 3% have raised Series B or beyond. “Until carbon markets mature and pricing becomes predictable, many venture investors will remain cautious," said Singhvi. In India, venture capital funding has largely concentrated on EVs and mobility, where risks and timelines are better understood. Since 2022, roughly $6 billion has flowed into startups spanning electric vehicles, battery technology and related transition sectors, producing two mobility unicorns, Ola Electric and Ather Energy. Even so, scale remains elusive across much of climate tech. “There are around 800 viable climate-tech startups in India, but less than 3% have raised Series B or beyond—it’s a serious scaling gap," said Biswas. Large upfront capital needs, long regulatory lead times and dependence on government adoption “keep many VCs wary," he added. “Mitigation demands patient capital; adaptation offers short payback cycles and clearer business models." Total climate-tech funding fell to $657 million in 2025, down from $1.17 billion in 2024 and $1.5 billion in 2023, according to data from Tracxn. The decline has been driven largely by a sharp slowdown in EV mobility funding, which has more than halved since 2023. The contrast is sharper when set against the behaviour of large global financial institutions. In 2021, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, predicted the emergence of a new generation of climate unicorns—companies built around green hydrogen, agriculture, steel and cement rather than consumer internet. Four years on, that thesis has hardened into investment strategy. Large asset managers increasingly view climate risk as a material financial risk, not an environmental externality. BlackRock, alongside Temasek, has backed companies such as Antora Energy, which develops thermal batteries for industrial decarbonisation, and ConnectDER—signalling how private capital is gravitating toward climate infrastructure and industrial transition plays that sit beyond the comfort zone of traditional venture capital. For shipyards, utilities and global asset managers alike, climate technology is no longer an abstract ESG theme but a hedge against operational, regulatory and market risk. Whether venture capital eventually follows, or is permanently leapfrogged by patient capital with longer horizons, will shape not just how India decarbonises, but who gets to build and own that transition. In shipping, what keeps a vessel afloat and profitable is often what lies unseen beneath the waterline. The hull—the lower portion of a vessel, which remains submerged—is its most critical and vulnerable component. Constant exposure to seawater and microscopic marine organisms make it prone to corrosion.

Large upfront capital needs, long regulatory lead times and dependence on government adoption “keep many VCs wary," he added. “Mitigation demands patient capital; adaptation offers short payback cycles and clearer business models." Total climate-tech funding fell to $657 million in 2025, down from $1.17 billion in 2024 and $1.5 billion in 2023, according to data from Tracxn. The decline has been driven largely by a sharp slowdown in EV mobility funding, which has more than halved since 2023. The contrast is sharper when set against the behaviour of large global financial institutions. In 2021, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, predicted the emergence of a new generation of climate unicorns—companies built around green hydrogen, agriculture, steel and cement rather than consumer internet. Four years on, that thesis has hardened into investment strategy. Large asset managers increasingly view climate risk as a material financial risk, not an environmental externality. BlackRock, alongside Temasek, has backed companies such as Antora Energy, which develops thermal batteries for industrial decarbonisation, and ConnectDER—signalling how private capital is gravitating toward climate infrastructure and industrial transition plays that sit beyond the comfort zone of traditional venture capital. For shipyards, utilities and global asset managers alike, climate technology is no longer an abstract ESG theme but a hedge against operational, regulatory and market risk. Whether venture capital eventually follows, or is permanently leapfrogged by patient capital with longer horizons, will shape not just how India decarbonises, but who gets to build and own that transition. In Mumbai, MGL, a stodgy, listed city gas utility. was led by the same rationale to invest in 3ev. The startup offers aftermarket services such as battery-as-a-service (BaaS), where it plans to deploy a bulk of the ₹120 crore funding from MGL, given that batteries are the most critical and fastest-degrading component in commercial EVs, making uptime, replacement and life-cycle management central to fleet economics. During its earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025-26, MGL’s management struck a careful tone: EVs, it said, are unlikely to dent compressed natural gas (CNG) demand in the near term. Yet, in the same breath, the company acknowledged investments such as 3ev as part of exploring adjacent energy transition opportunities, describing it as a long-term equity bet with limited near-term financial impact. “Mahanagar Gas’s management was actively analysing the transition to electric mobility—what it would mean for gas distribution, transportation demand… It wasn’t just an internal discussion; investors and analysts were asking the same questions," said Peter Voelkner, managing director of 3ev. The move marks MGL’s first meaningful step into EV operations, though the company had earlier dipped its toe into e-mobility, including EV charging infrastructure, in collaboration with Tata Power in 2019. More recently, MGL acquired a 44% equity stake in International Battery Company India last February. “MGL’s earlier engagement with Tata Power in 2019 on EV charging infrastructure was part of nascent sector exploration. Its lead investment in 3ev represents a meaningful escalation, transitioning from collaborative pilots to capital commitments in core EV value-chain companies," said Biswas. 3ev is currently piggybacking on MGL’s footprint in Mumbai, with pilot projects placing fast-charging infrastructure at the utility’s CNG filling stations. Beyond Mumbai, the company operates independently in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Coimbatore. The green imperativeIf utilities and shipyards are making cautious, balance-sheet-light bets, global climate capital is moving with a different calculus. International investors and corporates, less constrained by domestic exit timelines, are increasingly backing Indian climate startups tackling longer-cycle problems such as carbon sequestration and regenerative agriculture—areas where traditional venture capital has been slow to commit. While Varaha is one example, other Indian climate-tech startups have also benefited. Arya.ag, which builds farm-gate infrastructure to reduce post-harvest losses, recently raised ₹725 crore in a Series D round led by GEF Capital Partners, a global private equity firm. “Global investors are greening their portfolios. Supporting climate projects in India helps them meet sustainability targets while accessing long-term growth," said Pradeep Singhvi, executive director, energy and climate practice, Grant Thornton Bharat, a management consultancy. Varaha’s model is simple: balance long-cycle carbon bets with faster climate and commercial returns. Flush with more than $42 million in funding, the startup last year struck a deal with Google, which agreed to purchase 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide removal credits from the Indian startup. A carbon removal agreement, or carbon purchase agreement (CPA), is a contract by which a company such as Google commits to buying future carbon dioxide removal credits from a supplier such as Varaha. It marked Google’s first carbon-removal agreement tied to a project in India and the largest involving biomass-based biochar—often dubbed “black gold" for soils. Varaha has since followed this up with another agreement with Microsoft last week, making it the tech company’s first carbon removal purchase in Asia. With biochar credits typically priced between $150 and $160 per tonne, a back-of-the-envelope calculation values these deals at roughly $16 million. So far, the New Delhi-based startup is the only Indian company to be listed on carbon removal standard and registry Puro.Earth. Prior to the recent infusion by Mirova, it had received funding from RTP Global, Japan’s Norinchukin Bank, Omnivore and Orios Venture Partners. Yet, interest from venture capital remains thin. Most climate-tech startups that have raised funding in India fall into adaptation-focused products—areas with clearer customers, shorter payback cycles and easier monetisation. Scale remains elusive across much of climate tech. There are around 800 viable climate-tech startups in India, but less than 3% have raised Series B or beyond. “Until carbon markets mature and pricing becomes predictable, many venture investors will remain cautious," said Singhvi.

Title: Legendary investor Rob Arnott outlines the 2-part strategy that's helped his personal stock portfolio double the S&P 500 over 8 months

Rob Arnott is revered in the investing world for his alternative passive index strategies, but when it comes to his own portfolio, the Research Affiliates founder likes to have a little fun playing the role of hedge-fund manager, too. In an interview on Thursday, Arnott detailed a leveraged long-short strategy that has allowed him to double the returns of the S&P 500 over the last eight months. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of his personal brokerage account showing this strategy having produced a 36.67% return since mid-May. The S&P 500 has returned about 14% in that time. The strategy comes from the idea behind the ETF Arnott launched in September: the RACWI US ETF (RAUS). The fund takes a fundamental approach to indexing, identifying companies with attractive qualities and valuations, and then weighting them by market capitalization. It essentially seeks to correct what Arnott sees as flaws in passive indexes like the S&P 500, which add stocks following periods of outperformance, only to dump them when they've underperformed. RAUS has a 95% overlap with the S&P 500. Seeking to capitalize on this concept outside the index, Arnott had the idea to take long positions on the stocks that his index includes which the S&P 500 does not, and take short positions on stocks that the S&P 500 includes but his index does not. He then amplified those positions with leverage. Every time William publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. "One really fun strategy, and I wish this had occurred to me back in '21, is what if we go long our non-overlap holdings, strip out the whole 95% that's overlapped, just go long our 5% non overlap and let's short the S&P's 5% non overlap," Arnott said, referencing when Research Affiliates launched its Cap-Weighted Index, on which RAUS is based. "Why stop there? Why not go 200% long and 200% short? I did that in my personal portfolio." Arnott could not share the names of individual stocks in his portfolio for compliance reasons. However, in September, he listed Palantir (PLTR), DoorDash (DASH), and CrowdStrike (CRWD) as examples of S&P 500 stocks not in RAUS. Examining a list of RAUS's holdings, a few examples of stocks held in RAUS that are not in the S&P 500 include Xerox (XRX), Zoom Communications (ZM), and Rivian Motors (RIVN). "One of my colleagues likes to say, 'Suppose I come to you and I say I've got this great strategy: I'm going to buy stocks when they've just doubled and when they're trading at twice the market multiple, and I'm going to sell stocks when they've just fallen in half and are trading at half the market multiple. Why don't you invest with me?'" Arnott said. "Most people would listen to that and say that's stupid, but that's the way index funds trade." In September, Arnott illustrated this inefficiency in passive index funds with Dillard's Department Store, a repeat constituent of the Russell 1000 index. "In the last quarter century, it has been removed from the index and added back to the index four times," Arnott said at the time. "So buy low, high, low, four times, and every time you're doing enormous damage to your wealth if it's the only stock you're trading." "How big a difference does it make? It's been a member of the Russell 1000 in 22 of the last 35 years. During those 22 years, it has underperformed the Russell index by 99%," he continued. "In the 13 years that it wasn't a member, it gave you 67 times the wealth of the Russell 1000." Jump to

Title: I had 90 days to find a job after getting laid off while on a work visa. A $50 book helped me land my dream role.

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aman Goyal, a 26-year-old associate product manager at T-Mobile. His words have been edited for length and clarity. I was laid off in September, just six months into my role as an AI product manager at an ad tech company. Because I'm from India and was on an F-1 optional practical training (OPT) visa, the layoff triggered an immediate 90-day deadline to either find a new job or leave the US. During my last job search in 2024, while finishing a master's degree in management information systems at Carnegie Mellon University, I submitted hundreds of applications before landing an offer. This time, the tech job market felt even tougher — marked by widespread layoffs, uncertainty around the Trump administration's proposed $100K H-1B salary rule, and intensifying competition for AI-related roles. Despite these challenges, I landed my dream role within 60 days as an agentic AI product manager at T-Mobile. These three things helped me get the job. After learning I'd been laid off, I took a few days to process the news before diving into my job search. It was a big surprise, as I had recently received a positive performance review. With my visa deadline looming, I knew I couldn't afford to wait long before starting to look. I applied for roles at several top tech companies and a few startups, but the startups that responded weren't willing to sponsor visas. I came across three roles at T-Mobile and applied to all of them. A friend referred me for two of the roles, but I accidentally left his name off the third application. Interestingly, the only role I heard back from was the one I wasn't referred for. The job description was closely aligned with my past experience, and the lack of a referral didn't hurt me. I think referrals have become highly overrated, especially since it seems like almost everyone has one. My referral contact was helpful in another way, though. I asked if he knew who the hiring manager was for the role, and he shared the hiring manager's name. I used the email-finding tool Hunter.io, which offers a free plan with a monthly search limit, to look up the hiring manager's email and sent a short message expressing my interest in the role. I could've asked my referral contact for the hiring manager's email, but not everyone feels comfortable sharing someone else's contact information, so it's helpful to have tools that let you find it yourself. Fortunately, I found the right contact — and shortly after, the hiring manager connected me with the recruiter to schedule interviews.

Landing an interview was only half the battle, and I knew I had to be fully prepared to make the most of the opportunity, so I spent about $50 on "Decode and Conquer," a product management interview preparation guide by Lewis Lin. By emailing the author with my receipt as proof of purchase, I gained access to a Slack community with more than 20,000 members, including aspiring product managers, current PMs, and professionals between jobs like myself. What I found most valuable about the community after I joined was how easily I could schedule mock interviews with other job seekers. Over about six weeks, I completed a few dozen mock interviews — some with senior or staff product managers at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. A few of them were also hiring managers in their current roles, which made their feedback especially valuable. One of the most helpful parts of the mock interviews was that they helped me build confidence and develop the muscle memory to answer questions spontaneously. Doing practice interviews — and also many real-life interviews — also helped me realize that many people focus too much on what they say during interviews and not enough on how they say it. It's essential to pace yourself, keep the interviewer engaged, and be mindful of how you're coming across, especially since attention spans are often short nowadays. Some interviewers prefer concise answers, while others appreciate more detailed responses. You have to read their body language and adjust your responses accordingly. I also learned how important it is to really understand the question before answering — instead of just reciting a rehearsed response. The community also proved valuable for networking. Over about five weeks, I completed six interviews with T-Mobile that covered a range of topics, from product design to system thinking and agentic AI. I felt confident throughout the process. I received an offer in early November, about six weeks after being laid off, and started the role later that month. Today, I'm working on projects closely aligned with my background in AI, and I'm genuinely excited about the direction of my work. One of the biggest pieces of advice I give to the young job seekers I mentor is that even in a tough job market, networking can still work. It may not come through a traditional referral, but in my experience, finding a way to connect directly with the recruiter or hiring manager can be a game changer. Jump to

Title: What to Expect in Markets This Week: Trump Davos Speech, MLK Holiday,
PCE Inflation, Netflix, Intel Earnings

It's a short trading week due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, but there is still plenty happening. Stock and bond markets are closed for the holiday on Monday, the day the World Economic Forum begins in Davos, Switzerland. President Donald Trump is expected to speak on Wednesday in Davos, where he is expected to address housing market reforms and other economic topics. The delayed Personal Consumption Expenditures price index for October and November is scheduled for release, as is the final reading for third-quarter Gross Domestic Product. Netflix and Intel lead the tech firms on this week’s earnings calendar. United Airlines, Johnson & Johnson, Travelers Companies, GE Aerospace, and 3M are also reporting this week. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Housing affordability is expected to be a key topic for Trump during his Wednesday address in Davos. He has announced several housing market reform proposals, including banning large institutional investors from buying homes and instructing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase mortgage bonds to help lower borrowing costs. PCE inflation data for October and November will be released on Thursday as the Bureau of Economic Analysis continues to catch up on reports delayed by last year’s government shutdown. The Fed’s preferred measure of prices follows last week’s Consumer Price Index report showing that inflation continued to cool. Officials will be closely watching the inflation reading ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, with central bankers divided over whether to continue to lower interest rates. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Fed Governor Lisa Cook's challenge to Trump's efforts to fire her. Netflix’s report and commentary, set for Tuesday, could offer additional insight into the streaming giant’s efforts to acquire Warner Brothers Discovery, which could be upgraded to an all-cash offer to match bids from rival Paramount Skydance. Netflix missed on its most recent quarterly earnings due to a tax hit in Brazil. Also reporting is Intel, the stock of which stock has been surging on optimism over its new AI PC chip and significant investments into the company from the U.S. government, Nvidia, and others. GE Aerospace, also slated to report, has seen its stock price near all-time highs after its most recent earnings showed strong demand for commercial and military aviation. Investors will be watching United Airlines’ report after rival Delta Air Lines reported a weaker-than-expected profit outlook, sending shares of airlines lower. Several Dow Jones Industrial Average components are also scheduled this week, including 3M, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Travelers Companies.

Title: Davos invokes spirit of dialogue, despite bleak outlook

Tony Connelly Europe Editor Donald Trump's inauguration happened slap bang in the middle of last year’s World Economic Forum, his return to the White House both exciting US chief executives and worrying European leaders in equal measure. Addressing Davos invitees by videolink, the US President gave a flavour of what was to come: every global company should invest in America or face tariffs, NATO countries should spend 5% of GDP on defence, Ukraine was ready to do a peace deal, the EU had been ripping off the United States for years thanks to its trade surplus. The bitterest gripe about the EU was that it had thwarted the building of a fence at his golf links in Doonbeg, Co Clare (not true). Twelve months on, that teaser has not done justice to the wrecking ball Mr Trump has taken to global trade, to respect for territorial integrity and to presidential and legal norms. If Davos is the kumbaya citadel of global trade and togetherness, then it should represent everything MAGA hates: yet, Mr Trump is coming, with the biggest ever US delegation, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff. Indeed, the World Economic Forum (WEF) looks like it is having a bumper year like no other, as if the collapse of normal trading relations and a rampant increase in threats to geopolitical stability have forced a displacement to the Swiss Alps out of sheer desperation. "There is historic record participation," says WEF Chief Executive Børge Brende. The truth may be more to do with changes at the top of the WEF hierarchy. For decades, the organisation’s founder Klaus Schwab was the ultimate grandee of the Davos set, cajoling the global elite to make the pilgrimage, and conducting interviews on stage in his gravely and heavily accented voice. Mr Schwab resigned in April last year, following an investigation into WEF’s workplace culture (he was later cleared by the board) and was replaced by Larry Fink, the chair and CEO of the US investment giant BlackRock. Mr Fink has turned out to be the ultimate powerbroker, reportedly singlehandedly convincing President Trump to return to Davos for the first time since 2019. He has managed to invite Jensen Huang, CEO and founder of the leading AI chip manufacturer NVIDIA (market capitalisation $5 trillion) who will make his first appearance. Mr Fink will also personally interview JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on stage. Choppering and limo-ing their way to the ski resort will be more than 3,000 participants from 130 countries, including 64 heads of state or government (including six of the G7 leaders, and Taoiseach Micheál Martin), 1,700 business people, including 850 chief executives and chairs of leading companies. "We will have a hard look at Iran, Gaza, Ukraine, and also Latin America, and what we're seeing in Venezuela." There will be 60 ministers of finance, 30 trade ministers, more than 30 foreign ministers, and 15 EU commissioners, including Ireland’s Michael McGrath. The biggest ever delegations from the Gulf, China, Asia and Africa will also be descending on Davos. There will be 150 academics and heads of think-tanks, and 10 Nobel Prize winners. Yet, that sense of can-do collaboration to tackle global problems appears entirely at odds with the zeitgeist. The WEF’s annual global risks survey, published this week, noted that "geoeconomic confrontation" had moved to the top of the list of chief executive concerns, up eight places from last year, with just under a fifth saying economic rivalries were most likely to trigger a crisis this year. Armed conflict between states was ranked as the second-biggest threat (the survey was done before the United States attacked Venezuela, abducting President Maduro, and before Mr Trump declared he would take Greenland "the hard way" if need be). Undeterred, the WEF organisers believe the forum is needed more than ever, even when confronting the most acute crises. "We will have a hard look at Iran, Gaza, Ukraine, and also Latin America, and what we're seeing in Venezuela," Mr Brende told a pre-Davos briefing. While critics of the snowy love-in - with its weird cocktail of thought leaders, spiritual gurus, tech utopians, corporate billionaires, climate activists, trade union leaders and anti-poverty campaigners - question the merits (or even morality) of Davos, its defenders say it offers an unrivalled way of taking big-picture challenges and then throwing power, money and expertise at them. "At the core of the annual meeting programme is the notion that we operate in a new economic reality where geopolitics, exponential innovation, the concepts of economic, societal, environmental resilience are deeply intertwined, and they're also interacting with each other at a rapid clip," says WEF Managing Director Mirek Dušek. "We need to figure out how we are going to trade with each other in the future." Challenges broken down into themes This year’s challenges have been broken down into five themes: how to revive growth, geopolitical threats, AI innovation, how to invest in people and how to build resilience in the sphere of nature, water and climate. The schedule does not shy away from the harsh new realities of Trump world. Under the heading "How can we cooperate in a more contested world?" there are plenty of panel discussions on the threats to global trade, not least when tariffs are weaponised to boost domestic production and as a bargaining chip in great power geopolitics. Oil corporations are now being used as a blunt force weapon by the Trump administration in Venezuela, while sectors such as car-manufacturing, semi-conductors and pharmaceuticals are being more intimately tied to national, or even European Union sovereignty. "The heyday of globalisation is not coming back," The Economist notes in its Davos preview. "The future is likely to hold yet more state involvement. The allure of commercial riches motivated Mr Trump’s toppling of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and is guiding his efforts to secure a truce between Russia and Ukraine." Senior WEF figures are nothing if not optimistic (the forum’s slogan remains "Committed to Improving the State of the World", and this year’s theme is "A Spirit of Dialogue"). "We need to figure out how we are going to trade with each other in the future," says Mr Brende. "And we have seen that trade has been pretty resilient. Trade is like water. It finds its way. We collaborate differently than in the past. Is more bespoke, is more plurilateral, all this we will try to figure out in Davos." How or whether that fits in with Donald Trump’s current thinking is hard to say. For him, bespoke means divide and conquer, attempting to peel off the odd EU member state here or there with inducements, threatening other countries with eye-watering tariffs for reasons that have more to do with personal grudges than economic statecraft. His speech in Congress Hall on Wednesday afternoon will be closely watched. Having once again insulted Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky as being the "obstacle" to peace, there is still the chance that he will meet him in Davos (Kyiv has suggested both leaders could finalise a peace plan there). The Taoiseach is expected to hold bilateral meetings with senior political figures, including the Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, as well as US tech chief executives. Nailing down his precise agenda is proving trickier than usual given the fear among corporate leaders about publicly consorting with non-US leaders in case they incur the wrath of President Trump. Despite that, IDA Ireland says they're expecting between 65 and 70 corporate leaders to attend their annual dinner in the Grischa Hotel on Wednesday evening with Micheál Martin. Last year the guest list tapered off to around 50 once it emerged that the Taoiseach was grounded in Dublin in order to form the new government. Sources suggest that this year there will be a healthy smattering of big names at the dinner, which will also be attended by Michael McGrath and Peter Burke, Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment. WEF organisers, indeed, argue that the start of 2026 finds the global economy in a more resilient shape than had been predicted a year ago. Despite that, global debt and low growth remain stubborn concerns, while geopolitical fragmentation and asset bubbles continue to pose risks. As usual, there will be plenty of speakers cheerleading the potential for AI to boost growth and productivity, while also accelerating progress in scientific and health research, as well as green technology. "We’re hearing from business leaders that when it comes to the opportunity side of things, this goes well beyond artificial intelligence," says Saadia Zahidi, senior managing director of WEF. "There is opportunity when it comes to medical and healthcare services, particularly with changing demographics. There’s opportunity when it comes to advanced manufacturing, especially when that starts blending with Artificial Intelligence." But the big geopolitical crises of our time will be front and centre. European leaders will include Germany’s Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain’s Pedro Sánchez, Finland’s Alexander Stubb, Polish President Karol Nawrocki and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. They are likely to impress upon President Trump the need to rethink his designs on Greenland and instead restore his focus to ending the war in Ukraine. Whether or not he will listen is another matter. Either way, Davos 2026 promises to be the most keenly watched gathering ever. Europe Editor © RTÉ 2026.

Title: 5 Grocery Chain Produce Departments You Should Skip

We all know the importance of incorporating fresh produce into our diets, but getting high-quality fruits and vegetables from the grocery store has become a struggle for many people over the past few years. Across social media, shoppers complain about lower-quality produce and higher prices from both smaller regional grocery chains and big corporations alike. It would be reasonable to wonder whether U.S. quality standards have changed in recent years, as grocery chains seemingly show more red flags in the produce department, like mold, odors, and shriveled produce skin. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a grading system for fruits and vegetables to ensure quality produce distribution, but the grades vary by type, making it hard to know what you're really getting from a particular USDA grade. And while many stores and chains use the same distributors and vendors, self-described employees and store owners report that some stores are willing to pay for first pick at the produce, meaning that by the time produce gets to less expensive stores that are unwilling or unable to pay to play, the fruits and veggies have been picked over, leaving only lowest quality options available. Although issues such as old, bruised fruits that lack flavor and vegetables on the verge of expiring or rotting seem to be a problem just about everywhere, some stores are worse than others. The following five grocery store chains, in particular, have produce departments you should skip altogether. While you may not think of Walmart primarily as a grocery chain, gone are the days when the store focused on general retail merchandise. Today, the majority of Walmart stores in the U.S. are either large Supercenters, with a huge array of produce, groceries, and other merchandise, or Neighborhood Markets, which emphasize groceries and produce over other products. While smaller discount stores with a focus on general merchandise still exist, they make up only 352 of what the conglomerate calls its total 5,206 retail units. With such a focus on groceries and fresh food, you'd think that Walmart would be a great place for produce. According to customers, that's not the case. Sure, it may be less expensive than produce at other stores, or convenient to get everything in one trip, but entire Reddit threads are dedicated to the quality of Walmart's produce (or lack thereof). Redditors cite a multitude of possible causes, ranging from staffing issues in the produce department to Walmart opting to purchase lower-quality produce from its vendors. Produce delivery orders are not immune to issues, either. In one Facebook post about Walmart grocery deliveries, customers complained of rotten, moldy produce. One wrote, "...the other day all my peppers were mushy, my cucumbers had mold, my fruit [wasn't] close to ripe, and some overripe to the point of liquid..." Other customers agreed, suggesting folks avoid the store's grocery options altogether, delivery or otherwise. Much smaller than the nationwide Walmart mega-corporation, Ingles Markets is prevalent in much of the Southeastern United States, particularly in rural areas. The first store opened in Asheville, North Carolina, in 1963, and the chain's sole distribution center and warehouse is still located just outside Asheville, within 250 miles of each of its more than 200 stores across Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. While a single distribution center and a relatively small footprint might lead you to expect higher-quality fresh produce, its customers have found quite the opposite. Many customers in the Asheville area, where there are approximately 20 stores within 10 miles of the city, express frustration that Ingles is the most ubiquitous grocery store in the area, particularly given the low quality of items like produce it carries. On the r/Asheville subreddit, whole threads are dedicated to the chain's issues, with users noting, "The produce quality is absolutely awful," and that the store sells "fruits and vegetables that have visibly gone bad." Others share that although they have to shop there for many items due to the dearth of other stores, "definitely not for produce or anything else fresh." Perhaps the worst thing about the store's produce is that the price doesn't reflect the quality. One Reddit user summed it up concisely, "And for this, Ingles expects you to be okay with Whole Foods prices." If you can, go somewhere else. Like Walmart, Target has begun focusing on its grocery department in an attempt to become a one-stop shop for customers. Unfortunately, its produce in particular isn't worth the supposed convenience, with customers online complaining about spoiled fruit and vegetables. If you're looking for even more convenience by ordering your Target groceries through a third-party app like Shipt, just know that those shoppers don't have access to produce that's any better than what you'd find in the store. As one Shipt shopper shared on Reddit, "Target produce is always crappy." Other shoppers agreed, citing strawberries, apples, avocados, and salads as some of the worst offenders. According to a former Target employee, staffing in the produce department is the issue. They shared, "A lot of times the cold goods that just arrived [were] prioritized to stock and the pallets were massive, so the other duties like making sure all the produce was up to date and fresh and throwing out the expired goods could often be missed or rushed." Luckily, Target's return policy extends to fresh produce, as long as you have your receipt and didn't purchase it through a third-party delivery service like DoorDash or Uber Eats. Still, if you have to return the produce you bought as part of your convenience shopping trip, it isn't all that convenient. You might be better off grabbing your produce elsewhere in the first place. We know, this one stings. Aldi super fans may be hesitant or unwilling to admit it, but Reddit says that Aldi's produce is the worst. Not only does Aldi have a limited selection of produce compared to many chain grocery stores, but the fruits and veggies are often not in the best shape. While it's possible to get fresh, vibrant produce at Aldi, customers note it's very hit-or-miss. Some online share stories about moldy fruit (especially berries), citrus fruit that doesn't taste like anything, and vegetables that are mushy, smelly, and rotten. Even if you do manage to find good-looking produce, there's a decent chance it will spoil relatively quickly. Some customers have even shared stories of otherwise perfectly good produce spoiling overnight in the fridge. The problem, it seems, may be similar to the one facing Walmart. While the store sells its produce for cheaper than other stores, that comes with a different kind of cost for consumers. According to an alleged employee on r/Aldi, the store doesn't buy the highest-grade produce; otherwise, prices would be higher. They noted, however, "We throw produce (and meat) twice a day, so if you want the best quality, try going right at opening or between 12-2 p.m." Although ACME Markets is another small, regional chain with stores in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and its native Pennsylvania, it operates under the umbrella of Albertsons Companies, one of the biggest food companies in the United States, which also operates chains like Shaw's, Star Market, and Safeway. Customers' online opinions of the produce department range from calling it "unreliable" and "severely lacking" to "nasty," "horrible," and "overpriced." Given that ACME is also one of the most overpriced grocery chains in America, it just doesn't make sense to do your produce shopping there. In response to a Reddit post asking why anyone shops there, one person noted the close proximity of ACME Markets compared to other stores. They revealed, "The nearest supermarket is an Acme. The next nearest supermarket is an Acme. The next next nearest supermarket is an Acme." Given the ubiquity of the chain, some people don't even realize how bad the store's produce is until they move to another area with more variety. So we're telling you now, go somewhere else for your fresh fruits and veggies.

Title: The first year of Trump 2.0

-324.17 -108.85 -58.00 + 2,516.00 + 15,238.00 -324.17 -108.85 -108.85 -58.00 -58.00 + 2,516.00 As the world has its fingers crossed waiting for the verdict on tariffs from the US Supreme Court, the US President Donald Trump would complete his first year in office on Tuesday. It was an eventful year to put it mildly — the kind that puts twist-laden thrillers to shame. The Oval Office kept buzzing with one executive order after another — on tariffs, immigration, DOGE, oil drilling, brokering peace and big-bang investments in AI — that kept the entire world on edge. At this juncture, we take stock of how the US economy and markets performed in the first year of Trump 2.0 and look at how US equities are placed for the rest of his tenure. GDP Under Trump, the US economy got off to a rocky start with real GDP contracting by 0.6 per cent in Q1-2025. This is the first time the economy had contracted since declining 1 per cent in Q1-2022. However, in Q2 and Q3, the economy grew 3.8 per cent and 4.3 per cent. These figures are quarter on quarter, seasonally-adjusted annualised growth rates. In the US, personal consumption expenditure or PCE accounts for roughly 70 per cent of the GDP. Though PCE pulled its weight in Q2 and Q3, the real kicker came from a sharp decline in imports and good growth in exports, particularly services. Readers can recall that Trump’s reciprocal tariffs kicked in from April 2025. Trade balance While discussing tariffs, let us also address balance of payments (difference between exports and imports). Data is available for 2025 up to October. Trade deficit (goods and services) between January and October widened by $56 billion year on year or about 8 per cent. In the same period in 2024, trade deficit grew about 13 per cent. This is probably because the US didn’t import as much after reciprocal tariffs came into effect, while exports continued to grow (6.3 per cent). Focusing just on goods, between January and October, imports grew 6.7 per cent year on year and trade balance widened 8 per cent. As can be seen from the chart, imports were front-loaded during January-March and barely grew/ declined in the months after. Based on 2024 data, the European Union (19 per cent), Mexico (16 per cent), China (13 per cent) and Canada (13 per cent) made up 61 per cent of total import of goods and are the top exporters to the US. Imports from China were hit the most with a 26 per cent decline. Imports from the EU and Mexico grew 7 per cent and 6 per cent, while those from Canada declined 5 per cent. PMI Domestic manufacturing wasn’t robust either, going by the ISM PMI (Institute of Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index). Barring January and February, the index never crossed the 50-mark (see chart). A reading of over 50 indicates an expansion and vice-versa. This is a hit rate of 17 per cent (two out of 12 months) versus 86 per cent in Trump 1.0 (2020 has been excluded due to Covid). Inflation Now, onto whether tariffed imports caused higher inflation. Here, we are going with the PCE index, which the Federal Reserve (Fed) targets to keep under 2 per cent. Prices had risen 2.7 per cent in December 2024. Since then, the index marked a low of 2.3 per cent in April 2025. In the months that followed, the index has been steadily up, marking a rise of 2.8 per cent in September. This is the latest reading on the index. However, going with CPI, that index, too, marked a low of 2.3 per cent (in recent times) in April. Prices steadily rose in the months after, to 3 per cent in September, but have since cooled to 2.7 per cent in November and December. These could probably be the months when the Americans consumed imported goods that were tariffed at negotiated lower rates, considering shipping time. It doesn’t appear that tariffs have caused prices to shoot up dramatically. It remains to be seen whether the PCE index, too, will replicate this trajectory and sustain below 2 per cent. Jobs The year 2025 has been a tough one for job-seeking Americans, with ‘Big Tech’ and other corporate layoffs. Unemployment rate, at 4.1 per cent in December 2024, crept upward to 4.5 per cent in November 2025 – such a rate was last recorded only in October 2021. It improved marginally in December to 4.4 per cent. Going with non-farm payroll additions, 49,000 jobs per month, on an average, were added in 2025, compared with a mean of 141,000 in the eight years between 2017 and 2024 (Trump 1.0 + Joe Biden’s term). This period is considered as it nullifies the job losses during the pandemic and the hiring spree that followed. June, August, October even saw a month-on-month decline in payroll. This is a phenomenon last observed only in December 2020. Macros in short: Consumption has done okay, although it needs to be noted that this is driven by a K-shaped economy. Imports have declined, jobs are in poor state and prices are uncertain to decline sustainably. S&P 500 in the first year of Presidents Before we move on to markets, here’s a fun stat. We compared how S&P 500 performed in the first year of Presidents — over 50 years, in the last 14 terms, starting from when Gerald Ford took over after Richard Nixon resigned (see Table 1). Trump 2.0 (2025) falls in the bottom half at the eighth position, with 2017 under Trump 1.0 the third best. With the mean of the sample at 11 per cent, 2025 is still above average. How asset classes fared US equities have given good returns. S&P 500, Dow Jones and the Nasdaq Composite have delivered 16 per cent, 14 per cent and 20 per cent, since January 20, 2025 (inauguration day) till date. While S&P 500 returned 16 per cent, its EPS grew just 12.5 per cent. Sector-wise performance of S&P 500 constituents has been given in Table 3. All sectors posted earnings growth, except for energy, while heavy-weight IT’s profit grew 26 per cent. The market cap of the Mag7 stocks expanded 20 per cent in aggregate, with their earnings growing 26 per cent (comparing 2024 earnings with estimated earnings for 2025, which is the sum of actual earnings up to Q3 2025 and consensus estimates for Q4 2025). Stocks excluding the Mag7 (S&P 493) have delivered 14 per cent returns for a 11 per cent rise in earnings. Within the Mag7, except Alphabet and Nvidia, the rest delivered modest returns between 1 per cent and 9 per cent. Alphabet and Nvidia returned 65 per cent and 34 per cent. Globally, equity indices have fared better than their US counterparts. Korean KOSPI and the Japanese Nikkei 225 indices stand out with returns of 92 per cent and 40 per cent, while Hong Kong-based Hang Seng rose 37 per cent. Indices in Europe — DAX, FTSE 100 and Euro Stoxx 50 delivered between 17 per cent and 20 per cent. This trend can also be observed in how currencies have moved in the comparable period. The dollar index (DXY) recorded one of its worst years in history (9th worst), falling 9.3 per cent. The Euro, GBP and Yuan gained 13 per cent, 10 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, while DXY fell 9 per cent. Tariffs-caused volatility, a falling dollar against the backdrop of a 20+ per cent correction in crude prices partly meant indices in Europe and China fared better. The falling dollar is also one reason why gold and silver gave stellar returns ($ terms) of 70 per cent and 197 per cent. On to the debt market now. Debt ETFs gave good returns. BlackRock’s iShares ETFs are presented in the table as representatives. Trump came to power when bond yields had spiked from the lows of September 2024, after the Fed started cutting rates, on fears that the rate cuts were premature. Through 2025, although yields have cooled, they have remained high and stubbornly above 4 per cent. What is noteworthy is that yields at the longer end of the curve have held up more (see chart). This could well be because of the lack of clarity as to whether inflation can be tamed and sustained under the Fed’s target range. If anyone was as excited about striking ‘deals’ after Trump, it should be the ‘tech bros’ of Silicon Valley, with their big-bang AI deals, often among themselves. The $500-billion Stargate project where OpenAI and Oracle are parties, Nvidia’s planned $100-billion investment in Open AI and the US government’s purchase of a 10-per cent stake in Intel for over $10 billion come to mind. The year also saw AI start-ups such as Anthropic, Perplexity and OpenAI raise millions of dollars at exorbitant valuations. With the economic use-cases for AI still only evolving, it appears as if the line between optimism and delusion have blurred on Wall Street. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and Meta are estimated to invest about $1.1 trillion in capex over 2025 and 2026. Applying a fixed asset turnover ratio of 2x implies an expected incremental revenue of $2.2 trillion which is 1.3x the current revenue of these five giants ($1.6 trillion) - such a revenue growth is highly unlikely To be fair, market did get jittery about AI stocks late in the year. However, even after steep corrections, stocks such as Oracle have still given good returns over the year and are yet valued at a premium to their five-year mean earnings multiples (see Table 4). For some, current valuations are baking in very high earnings growth expectations, anywhere between 50-130 per cent, over the next 12 months. For Mag7 stocks such as Alphabet and Meta, the cash cow of ad revenue has to fire to support capital investments in AI – and such revenue is tied to sustainability of strong consumption, especially on a high base. The combined market cap of top AI stocks is now over 42 per cent of S&P 500’s full market cap, and the combined earnings are over 30 per cent of the combined earnings of all S&P 500 stocks. Clearly, a lot is riding on the AI wave. In 2026, either AI clicks or the stocks fold. The past year has been a strange one where all asset classes performed well — equities, real assets and debt. Such scenarios don’t last long, and the near future could prove investors in one or more asset classes wrong. For now, that asset class could be US equities. The S&P 500 trades at a P/E ratio of 28x, building in an estimated earnings growth of 16 per cent over the next 12 months. As can be seen from the chart, the index is now trading at valuations above sub-prime peak levels and at similar multiples as the dotcom bubble. While robust AI-led earnings growth is not a given at this stage, rerating in equities can be even challenging – with yields at the longer end not giving in. While the bullish views on the AI trade and consequently the US markets is now well known, it would be worth taking note of an interesting point brought out by long-term fund manager Dr John Hussman. He was prescient in his bearish calls, just ahead of the peak of the dotcom bubble and the 2007 housing bubble. While his bearish views over the last few years have not played out, he makes an interesting point for investors to ponder. He points out that corporate profits (surplus) have reached record levels and this has been made possible by the deficit/ debt of the other two sectors – namely, households and government. While household and government debt has grown to exorbitant levels, equities’ valuations are still factoring in record surpluses of corporates to sustain, ignoring events such as credit defaults. If such events unfold, equity bulls could be caught napping. Recent tremors in the US private credit market must not be ignored. In other words, sustained good returns in US equities would require continued increase in government deficit. His view: Even taking the sectoral deficit/surplus structure as durable, I expect we’ll see market losses, both in the S&P 500 and in the technology sector, on the order of -50 per cent to -70 per cent over the completion of this cycle. While Trump takes pride in record stock market levels, the real test will be in 2026, as brewing affordability crisis undermines macro-economic numbers, cracks emerge on the AI trade, tariff impacts deepen, showdown with the Fed heats up and geopolitics is at its toughest in decades. All this must be offset by an AI miracle to justify the current S&P 500 valuation. Published on January 17, 2026 Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: ICYMI: the week's 7 biggest tech stories like Apple losing to Google, and Meta giving up on VR

Here's your firmware update for January 16, 2026 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week, Meta turned its back on VR, and Apple caved to Google in its hunt for an AI update for Siri. To catch up on these and the other seven biggest tech news stories of the week, scroll down to see our recaps of the big things that happened. When you're done, check out the seven new movies and TV shows to watch this weekend. It hasn’t been a great time for drone fans in the US, with the FCC recently banning the sale of new, foreign-made drones – and a separate proposal from the US Department of Commerce taking aim at all Chinese drone imports (including existing models that have already been launched). Well, fortunately, a U-turn from the latter has removed that particular restriction from the equation for now. That means that stock of previously approved drones like the DJI Mavic 3 Pro and the Antigravity A1 can still be legally imported into the US. Still, with the FCC effectively banning the sale of foreign-made drones that it hasn’t approved (in other words, all new models), the future still looks bleak for Stateside drone fans. We got our first look at Sophie Turner as filming on Amazon’s Tomb Raider TV show begins, and the recreation of the character’s iconic video game look is perfect, highlighting to fans of the games how seriously Amazon is taking this adaptation. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Obviously, this is just a still of Turner in her costume, but she is undeniably Lara Croft in it, and if similar care and attention has been paid to the rest of the cast (which includes Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver, and Martin Bobb-Semple, among others) as well as the show’s story, we could be in for a real treat. No release date has been given yet, but we can’t rule out a mid- to late 2026 launch. Over the past few weeks, Spotify Premium subscribers have been encountering AI-generated music recommendations in their Discover Weekly and Release Radar playlists, prompting the music platform to introduce labels to identify AI-generated music in a monster Reddit thread. According to users who have experienced this, the issue with AI music on Spotify is only getting worse; the problem doesn’t lie with AI music itself, but with the deception on Spotify’s part, which is what’s getting under people’s skin. This has led many paying users to think it’s part of a wider, secret business plan and that Spotify is deliberately doing this to avoid paying artists further. In other news, Spotify has also raised subscription prices for US members, affecting all tiers. It marks the third price increase since 2023, which many people are attributing to the maintenance of Spotify Lossless. This week, Meta seemed to give up on VR as it slashed Reality Labs jobs, including closing down several VR game studios, and ending updates for the excellent VR fitness platform Supernatural. The news is a tragedy for fans of the Meta Quest system as it suggests Meta’s future support for its headsets will be at least a little lackluster, and Hamish Hector argued that, as things stand, he’s only interested in the Steam Frame. It’s no secret Reality Labs has been hemorrhaging funds for some time, but this major about-turn from Meta might lead some to wonder if you can trust the company not to change course again if its new AI glasses focus starts to go awry. Google has just dropped "Personal Intelligence" for Gemini, and it might be the most significant leap for AI assistants yet. This upgrade allows Gemini to securely tap into your personal Google ecosystem (Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube) to provide deep, individualized context for your queries. The capabilities are genuinely impressive: imagine Gemini diagnosing a car issue by checking your Gmail purchase history for the model, scanning your Photos for service records, and pulling DIY solutions from YouTube. It’s the "true" AI assistant we’ve been waiting for. Interestingly, given the newly announced Apple-Google AI partnership, this looks like a sneak peek at how the next-gen Siri might function in iOS 27. Apple got served a huge slice of humble pie this week, as it conceded Ai supremacy to Google announcing that Siri’ s next-gen version will be backed by Gemini. A lot of questions remain, but in a joint statement Apple and Google revealed “These [Gemini] models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.”Apple first unveiled its plans to launch an AI-upgraded Siri during WWDC 2024 but almost two years later we’re still waiting for the upgrade. The company has since promised a Spring 2026 launch, and with Google Gemini it might finally make that happen. Well, we have officially had the first major outage of 2026, and it was a massive, nearly 8-hour outage that took out Verizon's cell service for customers across the United States on January 14, 2026. You can see our full reporting in the live blog linked below, but it was a serious, hours-long event that saw folks with Verizon swap 5G and network bars for SOS with no access to voice, text, and data across much of the country. Down Detector reports swelled around 12:30 PM ET, with Verizon confirming the issue at 1 PM, but many folks did not see any signs of recovery until closer to 8 PM ET that evening. The carrier didn't have the best communication during the event, with only a few statements that came hours apart. The day after the outage, Verizon confirmed each account would receive a single $20 credit, which, simply put, many customers were not pleased with. The carrier also confirmed to TechRadar that it was a software issue tied to a cyber incident.

Title: ‘They’ve pickled each others’ brains’

Longtime entrepreneur and critic Anil Dash on where the tech industry has been and where it may be going 2:00 PM PST on January 14, 2026 Tech entrepreneur and writer Anil Dash. Photo: Anil Dash Advertisement opens in a new tab. These are tough times for tech workers. Half-a-million tech workers lost their jobs in 2025 as their companies continued to invest, insatiably, in AI and deploy products that have caused psychosis in their own investors, seamlessly produced and proliferated child sex abuse material, and encouraged teenagers to kill themselves. So-called “hard tech” is in: Jobs in defense and surveillance are the hottest roles on the market. Working 9-9-6 (that’s 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week) is the new answer to work-life balance. And for anyone still holding onto the progressive, pro-immigrant, “democratizing” dreams of the tech industry of the 2010s, Big Tech leaders (and some of their partners, including a distracting Lauren Sánchez) made their new political alignment clear as day just under a year ago, when they joined Donald Trump at his second inauguration. Anil Dash is not surprised by the dark turn the industry has taken. As a seasoned entrepreneur, prolific early blogger, and proponent for civil liberties in the digital world (he sits on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation), Dash has kept a close eye on tech leaders and chronicled the impacts on the workforce in his blog, including a recent post with the howling headline How the hell are you supposed to have a career in tech in 2026?. To usher our tech-minded (and anti-tech-minded) readers into 2026, Gazetteer SF got Dash on the phone for a chat about AI, labor, why the MAGA ethos has taken hold of the industry, and a grand VC conspiracy. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You said this moment in tech is “grim” and “about as bad as you’ve seen.” What are the forces that have brought us to this moment? A great one, that is going somewhat underreported, is just the numbers. ChatGPT came out in late 2022, a little over three years ago, and since then there have been over half-a-million layoffs across the tech sector. Just that one signal — put all the other things aside — that’s decimation. That’s twice as much as the DOGE guys cut in the federal government. This would be devastating if it was the auto industry. It’s ten times as many people as work in the entirety of coal mining. It’s shocking to think about that many jobs gone. This industry’s been gutted. In any normal time, people would say, “Oh, this is a recession.” But because those same companies [who are doing layoffs] are doing this financial sleight-of-hand where they’re doing deals with each other — like, “We’ll buy machines from you and you buy AI from us,” — they make it look like the share prices are going up, so it doesn’t look like a recession. That’s part one. Part two is what we’re seeing at the top, which trickles down to tech workers and creates this really grim outlook. What I mean is we’re seeing this new technique of the leaders of these companies — the investors, owners, CEOs — are now able to make money even if the companies never make money. That’s new. It started a little over ten years ago, and I’ll give you Uber as an example. Before they went public, Uber had only ever lost money. Billions and billions of dollars. And yet, their investors were still able to make billions of billions of dollars in profit by making this thing public and recouping that money on IPO day. That is different than everything else in the prior history of the industry. What they figured out was if you tell a great story, and, importantly, if you get a legal monopoly, which Uber and Lyft basically did, you can print money kind of without regard to whether it ever makes sense as a business or not. So that’s been a pattern with everything that’s followed, whether it’s crypto or AI. This isn’t even venture capital anymore. Venture capital means you take a risk. High risk, high reward. If there’s no risk, that's not venture capital. This isn’t even venture capital anymore. Venture capital means you take a risk. High risk, high reward. If there’s no risk, that’s not venture capital. If you wouldn’t call this venture capitalism, what would you call it? It’s pure crony capitalism. Corruption capitalism. These days, when you go to raise, the VCs are explicit about how they’re all talking to each other about what your business is, what your economics are, what they think of your company, what they each think they might offer you. That is collusion. They’re not competitors. It is essentially one company with different divisions, openly sharing information against entrepreneurs. If you get to even a Series B, you will have to take money from either Andreessen Horowitz or Founders Fund or Ron Conway, and it’s straight-up Godfather shit. They’ll say, “You’re gonna need help some day, and we can help you. We know PR. If you get stuck, we know someone in the White House.” Let’s talk about the tech and White House. When we think of the tech industry of the 2010s, we think of progressive, optimistic ideals. Now, we’re seeing the hard tech era and tech leaders cutting DEI and supporting Trump. For those of us who weren’t there, was the tech industry of the 2010s just marketed differently, or did it really operate differently? For workers, it was genuinely really different. It was peak Obama optimism era, and it was 100 percent sincere. The creature comforts were really good, the benefits were great, the holiday parties were huge. And structurally, tech companies were genuinely providing upward mobility for people. They were genuine advocates for H-1B visas. People now are at this point where they're so beaten down they're kind of like, “Was it all a lie?” But I had enough visibility and access, like I’ve had dinner with Jeff Bezos, I’ve been in the room, and I can say they were different. They have changed, and been changed by intentional political actors like Peter Thiel and Curtis Yarvin. And now they’ve pickled each others’ brains. Do you think today’s founders have to move in this more libertarian direction to survive in this industry? They don’t even have to move. I talk to young founders these days and for them, there’s no other world than the Trump world. I ask them what inspired them to go into tech and they say they read Marc Andreessen’s manifesto, they read Peter Thiel’s books, and I think, “Oh, your brain’s cooked.” They come in pre-pickled. But everyone else who could have told an alternate narrative has been hounded out of the industry. In terms of the libertarian bent, those intentional political actors like Peter Thiel were very intentional about it. They created their own media ecosystem. They created Substack — they, meaning Andreessen Horowitz is a big investor — and paid to have content on there that would drive users to their own media. They took over culture. On the topic of VC media ecosystems, I saw the Thread you posted a few days ago about common things VCs believe. One was “Platforms need Nazis on them.” What do you mean by that? Well, it’s inciting. These guys like Thiel and [White House AI czar David] Sacks have been fixated for 30 years on trying to normalize and re-assert the public use of slurs. One of the examples they use [in their 1998 polemic The Diversity Myth] is the r-slur, which had just fallen out of favor in the early ‘90s. And they were explicitly saying not being able to use these slurs reflects growing political power from these groups, and that's why we need to bring them back. I have these notes that I’ve written, and I need to wait until I can like spend my entire waking hours defending the onslaught of shit I’ll get for writing it, but I really think the thing that they’ve been working towards for 10 years is to get Trump to be able to use the n-word in public. And I think we are less than a year away. I really think the thing that they’ve been working towards for 10 years is to get Trump to be able to use the n-word in public. And I think we are less than a year away. That is dark. I can’t even contain my reaction to that. That is scary. I want to be wrong. But, yeah, they want to make sure [marginalized groups] don’t have power, and that’s signified by having Nazis on a platform. On that note of power, with all the layoffs and the bleakness among the workforce, do you think we’re going to see any sort of labor power movement in the tech industry? I’m hopeful. There was a moment in 2018, 2019, 2020, early COVID, when I thought there was going to be a moment. That’s when you had Amazon workers unionize in Staten Island [in 2022] and the first Google union [in 2021]. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that in the next 18 months after that they put $10 billion into teaching tools how to code. Like, ChatGPT comes at the end of 2022, right? It’s not entirely because of that, but it’s not not because of that. Also, like I said, [tech workers’] brains are pre-pickled. They don’t know the first thing about labor, and they’re trepidatious about learning because it’s coded “other.” Like, solidarity with the people serving meals in their workplaces is terrifying, because those people are completely disposable. None of those people have equity, none of those people have any job security. To somebody graduating college in 2026, would you recommend a career in tech? I think it’s hard. But compared to what? Compared to being a prison guard? Yes. But I do think tech is going to be the industry that is most changed by AI. Right now, ChatGPT can write a memo for you, write code for you. But the tools they’re building now, it’ll be more like one tool will replace an entire team of software engineers. For someone entering college in 2026, would you recommend studying computer science? It puts a pit in my stomach to say it, but no. I think [coding] should be part of people’s lives, for sure. But should you go into it as a career? I feel the same way about it when somebody says to me, “I’m going to learn an instrument for a living.” I’m like, “Well, hold on.” If you’re going to be the best in the world at that instrument, okay, go ahead. But if you’re not going to be the best in the world, it’s going to be a hard road for you. Last year, we heard so much about the AI bubble. Do you think we’ll see a crash in 2026? They’ve sort of economically engineered themselves out of crashing, and this is sort of similar to the de-risking of venture capital. When there's no risk, you don’t have crashes and you don’t have bailouts. And this is sort of, again, a feature of fascism versus capitalism. It was trendy in the last couple of years to call where we’re at “late-stage capitalism.” Would you call this fascism? Yeah, we’re there. Okay, the million dollar question: Do you still feel optimistic about the tech industry? Well, I have to believe. Part of the reason why is that I’ve seen it change people’s lives for the better. I think you can still build a thing that does connect the world and enables people to be part of the lives of people they love using technology. People can do it again. I think people are starting to understand the stakes. People understand that Elon Musk made a machine that makes child abuse material. I think it has to get pretty dire before people will make a change. But I think it can happen again. Do you see anybody leading that charge? There are some small projects, but I don’t want to blow anybody up yet. They’re fragile. Advertisement opens in a new tab.

Title: XRP Social Interest Explodes To Rival The Likes Of Bitcoin – Details

Time Published: 2026-01-17T05:00:46Z

XRP is in the center of crypto conversations, with social interest on X rising to levels that now rival Bitcoin. Recent data tracking the most searched cashtags on the platform shows XRP consistently appearing among the dominant assets drawing user attention. Interestingly, this surge in visibility is not happening in isolation but in tandem with a series of regulatory, institutional, and ecosystem developments within the XRP ecosystem. Data tracking the most-searched cashtags on the social media platform X shows XRP climbing alongside other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, a closer look at the data shows that XRP has received many more cashtags compared to other cryptocurrencies. This trend was revealed by Nikita Bier, head of product at X, who shared a visualization chart of recent search behavior on X. The chart data shows that XRP has consistently appeared among the most queried assets on X since December 2025. Throughout the period depicted, top cashtag traffic has been fluctuating with daily rhythm as X users scan the platform and post on X with cashtags. The share of searches attributable to $xrp slices into a larger portion of the total during days in early January 2026, which indicates extended interest. On some dates, XRP’s presence in the search mix rivals that of $btc and $eth, which are typically the dominant anchors of crypto attention on social media. The chart also shows how other tags wax and wane alongside XRP’s performance. Some days show greater fragmentation, where interest is spread across stocks such as $iren (IREN), $tesla (Tesla), $gme (GameStop), and $asts (AST SpaceMobile Inc.). Nonetheless, the trajectory for XRP in the first half of January shows a growing base of people actively getting involved in the cryptocurrency. Top Cashtags Searched On X Social interest on X is a mix of speculation and ecosystem developments, which XRP is currently sitting at the center of. Behind this spike in attention are tangible developments surrounding Ripple and the XRP ecosystem. One recent example is how Ripple secured regulatory approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, obtaining both an Electronic Money Institution license and cryptoasset registration. Ripple’s regulatory buildout is expanding across Europe, with additional approvals in Luxembourg as part of its push to operate on both sides of the continent. Interestingly, there are also indications of deeper engagement with Ripple’s ecosystem on the institutional side. Rumors and mentions on X indicate that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has started to use Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin (RLUSD) as collateral. However, this move is yet to be confirmed by BlackRock. These updates, combined with many others, help explain why social interest and cashtag searches for XRP have recently been on the rise on X and other social media platforms.

Title: Ubisoft Cuts 55 more jobs in Sweden after Halifax studio closure and unionization vote

Toward the beginning of the new year, Ubisoft announced its second round of terminations amid an organizational restructuring that could affect an estimated 55 positions across its Swedish studios, including Ubisoft Stockholm and Massive Entertainment. This follows a call for a voluntary leave program in the fall of 2025. Ubisoft informed its employees about these changes on January 13 and explained that they came after the completion of the voluntary program, concluding a long-term roadmap and evaluating the structure required to operate effectively. In a statement to IGN, Ubisoft said, “Earlier today, we informed all employees in our Swedish studios (Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm) about a proposed organizational restructuring that may affect approximately 55 roles across Malmö and Stockholm.” The company further explained: This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clear visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainability over time. Ubisoft stressed that these layoffs were not tied to individual employee performance or recent game releases, but to structural requirements. One of the affected studios, Massive Entertainment, has been known for its work on The Division series, Star Wars Outlaws, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. It has been one of Ubisoft’s key contributors since the studio’s acquisition in 2008. Ubisoft Stockholm, on the other hand, had opened recently, collaborated on the Avatar project, and was reported to be working on an unannounced project. Ubisoft reassured the studios that these restructuring shifts would not affect their long-term roadmaps and that projects currently in development, such as The Division 3, would not be affected. To put things in perspective, this is the second wave of job cuts under Ubisoft's helm in 2026. Earlier, on January 6, Ubisoft announced the shuttering of its Halifax studio, resulting in the termination of 71 employees. Strangely, this shutdown happened right after the studio voted in favor of unionization. However, Ubisoft insists that this decision was made in tandem with the company’s efforts to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and cut costs. The Halifax team has worked on mobile titles like Assassin’s Creed Rebellion. Buy Assassin's Creed Shadows on Amazon here IGN

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/16/2026 8:32:32 PM PST by SunkenCiv In this video, we analyze 2 stocks that were bought by congress in the recent quarter. Congress Just Loaded Up On These 2 Stocks! | 13:32 Dividendology | 241K subscribers | 157,468 views | January 13, 2026 Unusual Whales (Excerpt) Read more at youtube.com ... [transcript] Congressional Trading Report 2025 Unusual Whales, the website that tracks congressional trading, just released their full report on Congress trading in 2025. And essentially like every single year, especially since 2020, there are plenty of congressional members who way outperform the S&P 500, with multiple members of Congress even returning well over 50%. Now, while this report is for the full year 2025, we’ve already seen a couple of interesting trades as we head into 2026. So, in this video, we’re going to be looking at two stocks that members of Congress have been recently buying. To analyze these two stocks, we’re going to be using forecaster.biz, which you can check out at the link in the description. It’s a tool that I’ve started using more, and I like that you can easily overlay things like sales, net income, price to earnings, and dividends over the share price, so you can see correlation. But, let’s go ahead and dive in. Stock Analysis: Broadcom (AVGO) The first stock that members of Congress have been buying is Broadcom, stock ticker AVGO. Now, this is a stock that’s already a large position in Nancy Pelosi’s portfolio. It’s currently the second largest position. And as you might already know, Broadcom’s performance over the last 5 years has just been exceptional, up 673%. If we look at the last 3 years, they’re up about 500%, and in the last year alone, up 53.76%, making it one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500. Now, of course, what’s interesting about this is if we overlay what’s gone on with the sales for this company in the last 5 years, you can see that the share price has essentially followed the sales growth of the business. And on top of this, they’ve continued to grow dividends at a very high rate. In fact, if we scroll down, we can see back just in 2017, they were paying out about 10 cents per share in dividends. And look, now it’s more than 6x at about 65 cents per share. Congressional Trading Insights Now, let’s talk about congressional trading for a moment. If we jump over to the political tab here on Forecaster, one of the things we will notice is there is already significant congressional buying in Q1 and Q2 of 2025. I mean, we’re talking about millions of dollars in some cases, but don’t point out Q3 and Q4. There is still significant congressional buying, especially more buying than selling. Now, when it comes to stocks like Broadcom, I see a lot of mixed reviews. Obviously, the stock has done unbelievably well in the last one, three, and five years. But look at what’s been going on with the PE multiple. The PE multiple has climbed extraordinarily high, especially in the last couple of years. In fact, if we look at the fundamentals tab, Forecaster’s listing the trailing 12 months PE multiple is about 70.37. There are very few stocks in the market with that high of a PE multiple. But it’s really important that we note a stock’s PE multiple by itself tells you absolutely nothing about the company without accounting for future growth rate projections. So for example, if we jump over to the raw data, look at revenue charted out over the past few years. Again, the stock price has followed the revenue growth. It’s followed the fundamental growth, and we can see based on the trailing 12 months, this growth is continuing into 2026. Now to be fair as it relates to Broadcom, it’s important we understand where this topline growth is actually coming from because it certainly hasn’t all been organic. This company has actually pursued a lot of acquisitions over the years, and most recently they acquired VMware, and that was just a couple of years ago when revenue was sitting at about 35.8 billion. So around right here is when they made that acquisition, and obviously since then revenue has jumped quite a bit. Growth Strategy and Financials So what we can see right now is they’re pretty much pursuing growth at all costs. Let me show you an example of what I mean. If we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the income statement, look at what’s happened to average shares outstanding. We can see they’ve actually issued more shares outstanding over the past decade. Why is that the case? Typically, in most instances, that’s not something we want to see. But the reality is at certain time periods, it can actually be a good thing. If a company can issue new shares when they’re trading at an undervaluation, yes, it still dilutes shareholders, but with the capital that they raise, if they can get a very good return on investment from that capital, it can still actually be beneficial to shareholders. So, yes, they’ve been issuing new shares. On top of this, look at what’s been going on on the balance sheet. If we scroll down and look at net debt again, what do you notice? Net debt has actually grown quite a bit for this company in the last few years. They are aggressively pursuing growth. And so the ultimate measure of whether or not this is actually paying off is by looking at what’s actually going on with free cash flow. Remember, a company has five options with free cash flow. They can reinvest back into the business, pay down debt, attempt mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares, and pay out dividends. And like we saw, Broadcom has rapidly grown dividends over the last few years. So free cash flow has grown at a very high rate. We can see in 2024 they were sitting at about 19.4. Looks like trailing 12 months. They’re already sitting at 26.9. And growth, whether you’re looking at earnings or free cash flow, is expected to continue for Broadcom, especially at a high rate. Take a look at this. If we look at Broadcom and look at the average expected earnings growth over the next few years, 2026 EPS growth should be at about 50%, 2027 nearly 40%, and 2028 around 25%. This is some of the fastest earnings growth that you’ll see out of any company in the S&P 500. Valuation Considerations And so all that to say, yes, the PE multiple like we’ve seen on Forecaster looks extremely high at 70.37, but when you start to look at forward-looking PE multiples and account for that future earnings growth, it doesn’t look nearly as bad as you would think. This is why in a lot of instances, we actually want to look at the price to earnings growth multiple. Now, we’ll come back and talk about valuation in just a moment, but make sure you understand that Broadcom is not just another semiconductor company. Yes, Semiconductor Solutions is about 61% of revenue, and this is what a lot of people focus on because their products are used by companies like Google, Meta, and Anthropic. And the company already has a $73 billion backlog. That’s right, $73 billion in backlog. So essentially, if we go back and look at topline revenue, we can see in 2024, it was 51.57 billion. Their management has stated they already have 73 billion in backlog for the next 18 months. So these earnings and revenue growth projections we’ve been talking about aren’t something that analysts are pulling out of thin air. These are projections that are based on the reality of the orders that are coming in for Broadcom. That should give you more confidence in the stock. But then the other sector of the business is infrastructure software, and this is where they have made some acquisitions. But the good news is this portion of the business has extremely high margins and recurring revenue characteristics. So is it too late to buy Broadcom, or is there still potential opportunity? Well, here’s where things get interesting. Let’s assume for this stock that the PE multiple gets reduced drastically in the coming years. Maybe it falls all the way down to about 35. So essentially, the PE multiple is going to get cut in half. Let’s also assume they’re able to meet earnings growth projections and that by the year 2028, estimated EPS will be sitting at about $17.60, meaning that earnings would have to grow at a rate of around 37.5% through the year 2028. Well, here’s what we can see. All of a sudden, if EPS by 2028 is about $17.54, which is actually slightly below the average analyst estimate, you’d still be looking at a compounded annual return of 15.41%, not including the dividends. And the dividend yield is low; it’s only sitting at about 0.7%, but again, dividend growth has been exceptional. So that gives you a return of around 77%, again not including dividends, likely closer to 80% when you include dividends. So this is a great example. We have to reframe the way we think about valuation because yes, this PE multiple looks absurd at first glance, but when you consider the earnings growth projections that are actually being determined by the company’s backlog, all of a sudden the valuation doesn’t look as extreme as it would seem. And again, I think this is one of the many reasons that we’re seeing congressional members continuing to add Broadcom to their portfolio even though it performed so well in the last year after they already loaded up. Verizon Communications Stock Analysis And the second stock on our list is an interesting one. Not one you would typically expect to see on this type of list, but that’s Verizon Communications, the high-yielding dividend stock. And this stock has actually been on the list of Congress buys before, but it’s been bought even more so recently. So, look at the political buying. What do you notice? There wasn’t much activity for the last few years, but in Q4 of 2025, buying activity surged for this stock. In fact, we saw the most buying activity for Verizon that we’ve seen in the last 5 years in Q4 of 2025. Now, this is interesting because really, if we look at the share price over the last 5 years, it’s down by about 29%. If we look at it in the last 10 years, it’s not much better, down by about 9.81%. Now, total returns obviously tell a different story because the stock is a high yielder. It’s yielding about 6.7% as of right now. So, what do we make of Verizon stock right now? What’s the issue? Why is the share price not climbing? Or is it still potentially a good dividend play? Well, again, we have to remember over the long term, share price is going to follow the fundamental growth. And if we look at the sales growth over the last 5ish years, it’s really been relatively stagnant. We can see this; it hasn’t gone really anywhere. So, let’s dive into this a little bit more. If we jump back over to the fundamentals and look at the raw data, let’s take a look at revenue growth. This is what it looks like over the past decade. No wonder the share price really hasn’t moved. Revenue has not grown at a very high rate. Really, it’s been somewhat in line with inflation over the past decade. Even if we come down here and overlay the one-year revenue growth rates, we can see it’s typically in the low single-digit range. Every now and then, they’ll actually have a year of negative revenue growth. Now, if we pull up the most recent earnings report, one of the things we will notice is we can see right here, total operating revenue in the third quarter was up 1.5% year-over-year. So, slight growth in that area. If we scroll down and look at things like total Verizon consumer revenue, that saw growth of about 2.9% year-over-year. And if we look at total Verizon business revenue, that was a decrease of 2.8% year-over-year. So again, even in the most recent quarter, we’re talking about very small changes in what revenue growth has actually looked like. But that being said, with the outlook that they’re currently giving, they’re stating that they expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2 to 2.8% and adjusted EPS growth of about 1 to 3%. So they expect fundamentals to continue to grow, but it’s quite slow growth. So the reality is people who are interested in Verizon, they’re buying the stock primarily for one reason. One, they either think it’s undervalued at current prices or two, they’re buying it for the dividend. So really, let’s assess the sustainability of those dividends. Now, if we look at the dividend history for this stock, they have a history of growing those dividends even though free cash flow has not been growing at a high rate. In fact, if we jump back over to this slide, we can see they have 19 consecutive years of growing that dividend. So certainly a dividend growth stock, but the dividend growth is quite slow. And we have to remember anytime a stock is growing dividends at a rate below the rate of inflation, that’s technically not dividend growth. That’s something to keep in mind that doesn’t get discussed very often. Now, if we jump back over to their consolidated cash flow summary from their recent earnings presentation, again, we can assess the sustainability of those dividend payments. Dividends are paid out of free cash flow. And if we look at the 9 months of 2024, free cash flow is 14.5 while dividends paid out was 8.4 billion. So that’s a very sustainable dividend. And if we look at the 9 months of 2025, we can see yes, dividends are higher. They’ve grown their dividend payouts, but free cash flow is higher as well. So it continues to look like an actually very healthy around 7% starting dividend yield with relatively low leverage. It’s at least in their target range. So what we can see is yes, that starting dividend yield looks sustainable at about 6.7%. But what about the valuation at its current prices? Well, to start, we can see they trade at an extremely low PE multiple, just 8.65. Essentially the opposite of what we just saw for Broadcom. A PE multiple far below the average of the S&P 500. But again, that doesn’t tell us how the stock is actually being valued because we have to account for future growth. And as we’ve already seen, growth is very slow for Verizon Communications. Now, with that being said, we can still use a dividend discount model to value Verizon Communications. If they’re growing revenues, earnings, and free cash flow at a rate of about 2 to 3% moving forward, then dividend growth of 2.25% is sustainable moving forward. And if they can achieve that dividend growth rate, that would give them a fair value of about $44.54, implying 10% upside from their current prices. So absolutely this is by no means a high growth stock, not even a medium growth stock. It’s a very mature company that’s a very capital-intensive business with a lot of debt on the balance sheet. But with that being said, it does look manageable. The dividend looks sustainable and based on just a 2 to 2.5% dividend growth rate, the stock actually does look slightly undervalued. So we may see this share price revert back to its intrinsic value. But don’t expect a lot of growth past that other than the starting dividend yield that you’ll be receiving close to 6.67%. So there you go. Those are two stocks that members of Congress have been recently adding to their portfolio. Very interesting! Broadcom now going at $351. per share I guess my Megalomaniac ambitions will remain on the distant back burner for the time being. By contrast, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is cheap, pays over 7 percent at this price. The expectation of lower interest rates may be the main reason for the interest by the Critters, but they may also be loaded up with inside information. 👍 It’s never too late to start. 😁 Look at the chart for VZ. It’s movement over years is bad. Buy some AVGO over the weekend, and sell it about noon on Monday. VZ seems to pay a reliable 7% dividend. This past week there has been a storm-the-battlements rally for certain tech companies; I suspect there will be some burnoff on them. Naturally, over time, well-run companies go up in value, but not on a straight line. 🤔 Free cash flow for VZ: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/VZ/verizon/free-cash-flow I certainly wouldn’t buy VZ for capital appreciation, but it is rock solid for a 7% dividend—at a time when it is tough to get even 4% on a cd or bond (not to mention the likely hood that interest rates will drop further in the coming year). Capital appreciation due to falling interest rates isn’t unlikely, but would be a short-lived phenomenon. VZ could become a trap regardless, as direct-to-satellite builds out over the next few years. Fatter dividends are available elsewhere among various capital mgmt outfits, but they are interest rate sensitive and are not immune to economic fluctuations. Jim Cramer is an idiot. He gets on my nerves (typical NBC politics), but he’s no idiot. Is there an ETF that trades based on following insiders? You can’t simply buy a stock that insiders buy, because you would also have to track when they sell. They might not buy & hold. An ETF is probably the best way to ride the tech tsunami that’s been going on, assuming it has a track record of good performance. Years ago a financial journalist had a piece in one of the mags back then. He looked at the best performaing mutual funds (ETFs are kinda new to this old guy who types with my hands), then researched who the managers were, and found that the all best performing funds had been run by just a handful of the best managers. Even the middlin’ ones can keep track of a basket of stocks better than any one of us can. In “Beating the Street”, Peter Lynch suggested self-managed portfolios are probably best limited to just five stocks. Nanci Pelosi is the New Cathy Wood.

I mean, we’re talking about millions of dollars in some cases, but don’t point out Q3 and Q4. There is still significant congressional buying, especially more buying than selling. Now, when it comes to stocks like Broadcom, I see a lot of mixed reviews. Obviously, the stock has done unbelievably well in the last one, three, and five years. But look at what’s been going on with the PE multiple. The PE multiple has climbed extraordinarily high, especially in the last couple of years. In fact, if we look at the fundamentals tab, Forecaster’s listing the trailing 12 months PE multiple is about 70.37. There are very few stocks in the market with that high of a PE multiple. But it’s really important that we note a stock’s PE multiple by itself tells you absolutely nothing about the company without accounting for future growth rate projections. So for example, if we jump over to the raw data, look at revenue charted out over the past few years. Again, the stock price has followed the revenue growth. It’s followed the fundamental growth, and we can see based on the trailing 12 months, this growth is continuing into 2026. Now to be fair as it relates to Broadcom, it’s important we understand where this topline growth is actually coming from because it certainly hasn’t all been organic. This company has actually pursued a lot of acquisitions over the years, and most recently they acquired VMware, and that was just a couple of years ago when revenue was sitting at about 35.8 billion. So around right here is when they made that acquisition, and obviously since then revenue has jumped quite a bit. Growth Strategy and Financials So what we can see right now is they’re pretty much pursuing growth at all costs. Let me show you an example of what I mean. If we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the income statement, look at what’s happened to average shares outstanding. We can see they’ve actually issued more shares outstanding over the past decade. Why is that the case? Typically, in most instances, that’s not something we want to see. But the reality is at certain time periods, it can actually be a good thing. If a company can issue new shares when they’re trading at an undervaluation, yes, it still dilutes shareholders, but with the capital that they raise, if they can get a very good return on investment from that capital, it can still actually be beneficial to shareholders. So, yes, they’ve been issuing new shares. On top of this, look at what’s been going on on the balance sheet. If we scroll down and look at net debt again, what do you notice? Net debt has actually grown quite a bit for this company in the last few years. They are aggressively pursuing growth. And so the ultimate measure of whether or not this is actually paying off is by looking at what’s actually going on with free cash flow. Remember, a company has five options with free cash flow. They can reinvest back into the business, pay down debt, attempt mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares, and pay out dividends. And like we saw, Broadcom has rapidly grown dividends over the last few years. So free cash flow has grown at a very high rate. We can see in 2024 they were sitting at about 19.4. Looks like trailing 12 months. They’re already sitting at 26.9. And growth, whether you’re looking at earnings or free cash flow, is expected to continue for Broadcom, especially at a high rate. Take a look at this. If we look at Broadcom and look at the average expected earnings growth over the next few years, 2026 EPS growth should be at about 50%, 2027 nearly 40%, and 2028 around 25%. This is some of the fastest earnings growth that you’ll see out of any company in the S&P 500. Valuation Considerations And so all that to say, yes, the PE multiple like we’ve seen on Forecaster looks extremely high at 70.37, but when you start to look at forward-looking PE multiples and account for that future earnings growth, it doesn’t look nearly as bad as you would think. This is why in a lot of instances, we actually want to look at the price to earnings growth multiple. Now, we’ll come back and talk about valuation in just a moment, but make sure you understand that Broadcom is not just another semiconductor company. Yes, Semiconductor Solutions is about 61% of revenue, and this is what a lot of people focus on because their products are used by companies like Google, Meta, and Anthropic. And the company already has a $73 billion backlog. That’s right, $73 billion in backlog. So essentially, if we go back and look at topline revenue, we can see in 2024, it was 51.57 billion. Their management has stated they already have 73 billion in backlog for the next 18 months. So these earnings and revenue growth projections we’ve been talking about aren’t something that analysts are pulling out of thin air. These are projections that are based on the reality of the orders that are coming in for Broadcom. That should give you more confidence in the stock. But then the other sector of the business is infrastructure software, and this is where they have made some acquisitions. But the good news is this portion of the business has extremely high margins and recurring revenue characteristics. So is it too late to buy Broadcom, or is there still potential opportunity? Well, here’s where things get interesting. Let’s assume for this stock that the PE multiple gets reduced drastically in the coming years. Maybe it falls all the way down to about 35. So essentially, the PE multiple is going to get cut in half. Let’s also assume they’re able to meet earnings growth projections and that by the year 2028, estimated EPS will be sitting at about $17.60, meaning that earnings would have to grow at a rate of around 37.5% through the year 2028. Well, here’s what we can see. All of a sudden, if EPS by 2028 is about $17.54, which is actually slightly below the average analyst estimate, you’d still be looking at a compounded annual return of 15.41%, not including the dividends. And the dividend yield is low; it’s only sitting at about 0.7%, but again, dividend growth has been exceptional. So that gives you a return of around 77%, again not including dividends, likely closer to 80% when you include dividends. So this is a great example. We have to reframe the way we think about valuation because yes, this PE multiple looks absurd at first glance, but when you consider the earnings growth projections that are actually being determined by the company’s backlog, all of a sudden the valuation doesn’t look as extreme as it would seem. And again, I think this is one of the many reasons that we’re seeing congressional members continuing to add Broadcom to their portfolio even though it performed so well in the last year after they already loaded up. Verizon Communications Stock Analysis And the second stock on our list is an interesting one. Not one you would typically expect to see on this type of list, but that’s Verizon Communications, the high-yielding dividend stock. And this stock has actually been on the list of Congress buys before, but it’s been bought even more so recently. So, look at the political buying. What do you notice? There wasn’t much activity for the last few years, but in Q4 of 2025, buying activity surged for this stock. In fact, we saw the most buying activity for Verizon that we’ve seen in the last 5 years in Q4 of 2025. Now, this is interesting because really, if we look at the share price over the last 5 years, it’s down by about 29%. If we look at it in the last 10 years, it’s not much better, down by about 9.81%. Now, total returns obviously tell a different story because the stock is a high yielder. It’s yielding about 6.7% as of right now. So, what do we make of Verizon stock right now? What’s the issue? Why is the share price not climbing? Or is it still potentially a good dividend play? Well, again, we have to remember over the long term, share price is going to follow the fundamental growth. And if we look at the sales growth over the last 5ish years, it’s really been relatively stagnant. We can see this; it hasn’t gone really anywhere. So, let’s dive into this a little bit more. If we jump back over to the fundamentals and look at the raw data, let’s take a look at revenue growth. This is what it looks like over the past decade. No wonder the share price really hasn’t moved. Revenue has not grown at a very high rate. Really, it’s been somewhat in line with inflation over the past decade. Even if we come down here and overlay the one-year revenue growth rates, we can see it’s typically in the low single-digit range. Every now and then, they’ll actually have a year of negative revenue growth. Now, if we pull up the most recent earnings report, one of the things we will notice is we can see right here, total operating revenue in the third quarter was up 1.5% year-over-year. So, slight growth in that area. If we scroll down and look at things like total Verizon consumer revenue, that saw growth of about 2.9% year-over-year. And if we look at total Verizon business revenue, that was a decrease of 2.8% year-over-year. So again, even in the most recent quarter, we’re talking about very small changes in what revenue growth has actually looked like. But that being said, with the outlook that they’re currently giving, they’re stating that they expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2 to 2.8% and adjusted EPS growth of about 1 to 3%. So they expect fundamentals to continue to grow, but it’s quite slow growth. So the reality is people who are interested in Verizon, they’re buying the stock primarily for one reason. One, they either think it’s undervalued at current prices or two, they’re buying it for the dividend. So really, let’s assess the sustainability of those dividends. Now, if we look at the dividend history for this stock, they have a history of growing those dividends even though free cash flow has not been growing at a high rate. In fact, if we jump back over to this slide, we can see they have 19 consecutive years of growing that dividend. So certainly a dividend growth stock, but the dividend growth is quite slow. And we have to remember anytime a stock is growing dividends at a rate below the rate of inflation, that’s technically not dividend growth. That’s something to keep in mind that doesn’t get discussed very often. Now, if we jump back over to their consolidated cash flow summary from their recent earnings presentation, again, we can assess the sustainability of those dividend payments. Dividends are paid out of free cash flow. And if we look at the 9 months of 2024, free cash flow is 14.5 while dividends paid out was 8.4 billion. So that’s a very sustainable dividend. And if we look at the 9 months of 2025, we can see yes, dividends are higher. They’ve grown their dividend payouts, but free cash flow is higher as well. So it continues to look like an actually very healthy around 7% starting dividend yield with relatively low leverage. It’s at least in their target range. So what we can see is yes, that starting dividend yield looks sustainable at about 6.7%. But what about the valuation at its current prices? Well, to start, we can see they trade at an extremely low PE multiple, just 8.65. Essentially the opposite of what we just saw for Broadcom. A PE multiple far below the average of the S&P 500. But again, that doesn’t tell us how the stock is actually being valued because we have to account for future growth. And as we’ve already seen, growth is very slow for Verizon Communications. Now, with that being said, we can still use a dividend discount model to value Verizon Communications. If they’re growing revenues, earnings, and free cash flow at a rate of about 2 to 3% moving forward, then dividend growth of 2.25% is sustainable moving forward. And if they can achieve that dividend growth rate, that would give them a fair value of about $44.54, implying 10% upside from their current prices. So absolutely this is by no means a high growth stock, not even a medium growth stock. It’s a very mature company that’s a very capital-intensive business with a lot of debt on the balance sheet. But with that being said, it does look manageable. The dividend looks sustainable and based on just a 2 to 2.5% dividend growth rate, the stock actually does look slightly undervalued. So we may see this share price revert back to its intrinsic value. But don’t expect a lot of growth past that other than the starting dividend yield that you’ll be receiving close to 6.67%. So there you go. Those are two stocks that members of Congress have been recently adding to their portfolio. Very interesting! Broadcom now going at $351. per share I guess my Megalomaniac ambitions will remain on the distant back burner for the time being. By contrast, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is cheap, pays over 7 percent at this price. The expectation of lower interest rates may be the main reason for the interest by the Critters, but they may also be loaded up with inside information. 👍 It’s never too late to start. 😁 Look at the chart for VZ. It’s movement over years is bad. Buy some AVGO over the weekend, and sell it about noon on Monday. VZ seems to pay a reliable 7% dividend. This past week there has been a storm-the-battlements rally for certain tech companies; I suspect there will be some burnoff on them. Naturally, over time, well-run companies go up in value, but not on a straight line. 🤔 Free cash flow for VZ: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/VZ/verizon/free-cash-flow I certainly wouldn’t buy VZ for capital appreciation, but it is rock solid for a 7% dividend—at a time when it is tough to get even 4% on a cd or bond (not to mention the likely hood that interest rates will drop further in the coming year). Capital appreciation due to falling interest rates isn’t unlikely, but would be a short-lived phenomenon. VZ could become a trap regardless, as direct-to-satellite builds out over the next few years. Fatter dividends are available elsewhere among various capital mgmt outfits, but they are interest rate sensitive and are not immune to economic fluctuations. Jim Cramer is an idiot. He gets on my nerves (typical NBC politics), but he’s no idiot. Is there an ETF that trades based on following insiders? You can’t simply buy a stock that insiders buy, because you would also have to track when they sell. They might not buy & hold. An ETF is probably the best way to ride the tech tsunami that’s been going on, assuming it has a track record of good performance. Years ago a financial journalist had a piece in one of the mags back then. He looked at the best performaing mutual funds (ETFs are kinda new to this old guy who types with my hands), then researched who the managers were, and found that the all best performing funds had been run by just a handful of the best managers. Even the middlin’ ones can keep track of a basket of stocks better than any one of us can. In “Beating the Street”, Peter Lynch suggested self-managed portfolios are probably best limited to just five stocks. Nanci Pelosi is the New Cathy Wood.

Title: Database maker ClickHouse raises $400M, acquires AI observability startup Langfuse

Time Published: 2026-01-16T21:49:01Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 16:49 EST / JANUARY 16 2026 by Maria Deutscher Open-source database maker ClickHouse Inc. today announced that it has closed a $400 million late-stage funding round at a $15 billion valuation. The Series D investment, which comes about six months after the company’s previous raise, was led by Dragoneer. It was joined by GIC, Index Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, T. Rowe Price and WCM Investment Management. The round follows a year in which ClickHouse’s annualized recurring revenue rose by more than 250%. “Major platform shifts ultimately reward the infrastructure companies that sit closest to production,” said Dragoneer partner Christian Jensen. “As models become more capable, the bottleneck moves to data infrastructure.” A storage device is divided into segments called sectors. Usually, each sector holds a few hundred or thousand bytes. ClickHouse’s namesake database places columns in sectors that are immediately adjacent to one another. That approach enables it to perform data analysis tasks such as averaging product prices faster than many competing platforms. ClickHouse also speeds up queries in other ways. When a user searches a large dataset for a specific piece of information, the system avoids looking through sections of the database that don’t contain the relevant record. It takes a similar approach to speeding up data modification queries. ClickHouse only updates the specific records that a user wishes to change instead of the entire dataset. The company monetizes the open-source version of its database with a paid cloud version. ClickHouse Cloud, as the service is called, removes the need for customers to manage the underlying hardware or manually install updates. The administrative tasks that it doesn’t perform on users’ behalf can be automated through integrations with third-party management tools. The company disclosed that its cloud service has over 3,000 customers. Its installed base includes Meta Platforms Inc., Sony Corp., Lyft Inc. and other major tech firms. The company also divulged that it’s acquiring Langfuse GmbH, a startup with an open-source tool for monitoring large language models. Companies use Langfuse’s software to track the latency and infrastructure usage of their LLM-powered applications. Additionally, it collects data on the workflow through which a model generates prompt responses. Developers can use that data to identify the root cause of hallucinations and find a fix. Langfuse uses ClickHouse’s database to store the LLM telemetry it collects. Following the acquisition, the latter company will enhance the integration between the two products. ClickHouse says the goal is to make its database a more competitive choice for developers building AI applications. Some AI applications run on not one but two databases. One is used to process complex analytics queries while the other supports simpler, frequent data management tasks such as updating customer records. Systems geared toward the latter use case are known as transactional databases. ClickHouse plans to roll out the enhanced Langfuse integration alongside a managed transactional database based on PostgreSQL. Like Langfuse, the service will be integrated with the company’s namesake columnar store. AI applications can use ClickHouse to power analytics queries and the managed PostgreSQL service to perform transactional database tasks.

Title: Trump Officials Vow to Keep All US Coal Plants Running

Trump administration officials vowed to keep US coal power plants operating, casting it as an imperative to meet surging electricity demand and drive a revival of the nation’s industrial base. “The goal is 100% open,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “That’s the standard we’re operating against.” Burgum’s comment came during the first meeting of Trump’s newly reconstituted National Coal Council, an advisory panel that Joe Biden let lapse during his presidency. President Donald Trump, by contrast, has sought to engineer a coal resurgence in his second term, including byrequiring some power plants to keep burning the fuel. The bullish Trump administration predictions for America’s coal — and the power plants that rely on it — contrast with a more skeptical view from analysts who point to generation from natural gas and renewables. The message comes as the Trump administration addresses concerns about rising electricity prices and consumer costs, an issue that weighs heavily on Republicans’ bid to keep control of the House and Senate in November’s elections. Focusing on the existing coal fleet works better as a short-term strategy, according to Andy Blumenfeld, director of data analytics at McCloskey by Opis. While they’re generating power now, many of the plants are old and will require significant maintenance if the administration expects them to remain in service for a while. And in the meantime, utilities will be able to turn to gas and nuclear capacity that will likely become more widely available over the next several years. “We need the power, and the coal units are there now,” said Blumenfeld. “But in the long term, they’re up against an aging coal fleet.” In a move aimed at addressing some of these issues, the Energy Department is putting aside as much as $525 million to upgrade or build coal-fired power plants, a move criticized by environmental groups. Trump has moved quickly to dial back regulations and subsidies that have encouraged emissions-free renewable power. Under Trump, the Energy Department also has issued emergency orders requiring some coal plants to keep running, and the Environmental Protection Agency recently rejected a bid by Colorado to force the closing of one of its coal plants in the central part of the state. Meanwhile, the Interior Department has also moved to open more federal land for coal leasing in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. “Seventeen gigawatts of coal generation are open today that would not have been open,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright, attributing some of that shift to the short-termemergency ordersforcing plants to operate. “You will not see those coal plants close during this administration.” Wright said utilities are now calling the Energy Department in a bid to keep plants running, despite some states pushing to shutter the facilities. Burgum, who leads Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council, went even further, predicting new coal plant construction — though many analysts have foreclosed the possibility. The National Coal Council meeting on Thursday included discussion of options for maintaining and growing the nation’s fleet of coal plants, as well as opportunities to expand exports of the fossil fuel. The roughly 60-member panel includes executives from some of the nation’s top coal producers, such as Peabody Energy, Warrior Met Coal Inc., Hallador Energy Co. and Nacco Industries Inc.,as well as power utilities and co-operatives such as FirstEnergy Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. Joe Craft, chief executive officer of Alliance Resource Partners, a Trump donor, is a member; Jim Grech, CEO of Peabody Energy is chairing the group; and Jimmy Brock, CEO of Core Natural Resources Inc., is vice-chair. US coal consumption has declined for years as utilities increasingly shift toward cheaper natural gas and renewables. Coal once accounted for more than half of the country’s electricity generation, but that share fell to about 17% in 2025 and is expected to slip to 15% this year. A boom in US electricity demand, however, has provided a near-term tailwind for coal producers. Utilities have delayed retirement of coal-fired power plants, while federal orders keep others running, supporting demand and contributing to a modest rebound in 2025. Electric generation from coal climbed 13% last year, driven largely by higher gas prices. The downward trajectory is expected to resume in 2026, according to government forecasts. During Thursday’s meeting, coal and utility executives warned about overdependence on natural gas as a US power source. Some urged doing more to protect America’s mines, others emphasized the need to keep rising electricity prices in check. Wright linked coal power to a thriving manufacturing sector, and Burgum said it’s intertwined with US efforts to win the artificial intelligence competition with China — both Trump administration goals. The immediate focus now is ensuring there’s enough electricity, especially for the data centers that are key to developing AI capabilities, said Randall Atkins, CEO of coal supplier Ramaco Resources Inc. and a member of the council who attended the meeting Thursday. “The objective is the data centers, and how we’re going to figure out how to power them,” Atkins said in an interview. Separately, Wright warned that if courts compel some of the world’s largest asset managers to divest coal-related assets, it could undermine efforts to buttress coal mining and electricity generation. That’s the potential outcome of a lawsuit alleging that BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and the asset management arm of State Street Corp. colluded to reduce coal output. Republican state attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say the firms violated antitrust laws by using environmental, social and governance-related initiatives, including carbon-reduction alliances, to suppress production.

But former Trump Energy Secretary and Texas Governor Rick Perry has predicted that if successful, the lawsuit would take an estimated $18 billion in coal holdings off the asset managers’ books. He said that outcome would pose “a direct threat to coal companies’ ability to raise capital, finance infrastructure and support jobs.” Photo: The PacifiCorp Hunter coal-fired electrical generation plant in Castle Dale, Utah.

Title: Bitcoin’s “quantum” death sentence is causing a Wall Street rift, but the fix is already hidden in the code

The quantum computing threat challenges Bitcoin's status as "digital gold," prompting strategic shifts. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The consensus that Bitcoin has matured into “digital gold” faces a new fracture line on Wall Street, one that has little to do with daily price volatility and everything to do with the distant future of computing. Two prominent strategists named Wood are currently offering diametrically opposed roadmaps to global allocators for the world’s largest crypto asset. On Jan. 16, Christopher Wood of Jefferies eliminated his firm’s long-standing Bitcoin exposure, citing the existential threat posed by quantum computing. On the other hand, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest is urging investors to look past technical anxieties and focus on the asset’s distinct lack of correlation with traditional markets. This divergence highlights a critical evolution in how institutional capital is underwriting crypto assets in 2026. The debate is no longer merely about whether Bitcoin is a speculative token or a store of value. It has shifted toward a more complex calculation regarding survivability, governance, and the specific type of hedge investors believe they are buying. Christopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, built a reputation for navigating market sentiment with his “Greed & Fear” newsletter. His latest move cuts against the grain of two years of institutional accumulation by removing a 10% Bitcoin allocation from his model portfolio entirely. In the reallocation, Jefferies shifted the 10% Bitcoin sleeve into assets with older narratives: 5% into physical gold and 5% into gold-mining stocks. A $4.6T wealth machine is turning “execution only” into real advice, and it starts with a tiny-sounding sleeve. The rationale is rooted in tail risk rather than immediate market dynamics. Wood argued that advances in quantum computing could eventually undermine the cryptography that secures the Bitcoin network. While most investors still file quantum threats under “science projects,” Jefferies is treating the possibility as a disqualifying factor for pension-style, long-horizon capital. This anxiety is finding validation among technical experts who argue the timeline for a threat is compressing faster than markets realize. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole, argued that a quantum computer could break Bitcoin in just 2 to 9 years without an upgrade, with a high probability in the 4- to 5-year range. Edwards describes the market as having entered a “Quantum Event Horizon,” a critical threshold at which the frontier risk of a hack is roughly equal to the time required to reach upgrade consensus and execute a rollout. In the Jefferies framing, the uncomfortable reality is that a quantum computer will someday be able to crack Bitcoin because its security assumptions rest on cryptographic primitives that are vulnerable to those powerful future machines. The specific threat involves adversaries “harvesting” exposed public keys now to store them and decrypt the private keys later when hardware matures. Estimates suggest more than 4 million BTC are held in vulnerable addresses due to reuse or older formats. This leaves a “harvest now, decrypt later” attack vector that could compromise a massive share of the total supply. Grayscale, one of the largest digital-asset managers, has sought to ground the 2026 market conversation by labeling quantum vulnerability a “red herring” for this year. Its analysis suggests that, while the threat is real, it is unlikely to drive prices in the near term. Considering this, Grayscale argued that in the longer run, most blockchains and much of the broader economy will need post-quantum upgrades anyway. This view aligns with developments within the crypto sector. Bitcoin’s 2028 doomsday clock: How ‘Quantum-Proof’ marketing manufactures FUD. Andre Dragosch, Bitwise Europe's Head of Research, has also countered the “immediate doom” narrative by emphasizing the sheer computational gulf between current technology and a viable attack. While Dragosch validated concerns about older wallets, he argues that the network itself remains extraordinarily robust. He wrote: “Bitcoin now runs at 1 zeta hash per second, equivalent to more than one million El Capitan-class supercomputers. That’s orders of magnitude beyond the reach of today’s quantum machines – and even beyond those expected in the foreseeable future.” Considering the above, ARK Invest is doubling down on the argument that Bitcoin belongs in modern portfolios precisely because it behaves unlike anything else. In a 2026 outlook note, ARK’s Cathie Wood leaned on correlations rather than ideology. Her argument is clinical: Bitcoin’s return stream has remained weakly linked to major asset classes since 2020, therefore offering a way to improve portfolio efficiency. ARK supported this view with a correlation matrix using weekly returns from January 2020 through January 2026. The data shows Bitcoin’s correlation with gold at 0.14 and with bonds at 0.06. Data shows there is no definitive top or bottom correlation between Bitcoin, gold, the S&P 500, and U.S. property. Perhaps most strikingly, the table shows that the S&P 500’s correlation with bonds is higher than Bitcoin’s correlation with gold. Wood uses this data to argue that Bitcoin should be viewed as a valuable diversifier for asset allocators seeking higher returns per unit of risk in the years ahead. This represents a subtle but important shift in messaging. ARK is reframing Bitcoin from “a newer version of gold” into “an uncorrelated return stream with asymmetric upside.” For investors watching the split between two of the market’s high-profile strategists, the immediate takeaway is not that Bitcoin is broken. It is that the institutional narrative is maturing into something more demanding. Jefferies is effectively saying that a hedge that might require a contentious protocol-level migration is not the same as physical gold, even if both assets can rally in the same macro regime. This is because gold does not require coordination, upgrades, or governance to remain a valid asset. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a hedge that ultimately depends on its ability to adapt. Conversely, there is a counterargument that traditional finance faces greater near-term peril from quantum computing than Bitcoin does. Dragosch said: “Banks depend heavily on long-lived RSA/ECC keys across authentication and interbank communications. Once quantum machines can break these, systemic attacks become possible – far earlier than any realistic threat to Bitcoin’s decentralized architecture.” With this in mind, ARK is effectively saying that the benefits of portfolio diversification can justify a BTC position, even if the asset is still evolving. So, the question that hangs over these cases is whether Bitcoin can credibly coordinate a post-quantum transition without splintering the social consensus that gives it monetary value. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

January 16, 2026 11:18 ET | Source: Equity Insider Equity Insider VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 16, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity Insider Market Intelligence Brief – The 2026 economy has hit the wall of physical limits. After a decade of rewarding "potential," the market has pivoted to demanding proof. Speculation is dying; tangible assets are repricing. The market has run out of patience for 'maybe.' Investors are trading speculative PowerPoint slides for real-world assets you can touch, mine, and measure. They are allocating to the Choke Points, wading through the physical and digital bottlenecks that control modern civilization. From the silver in your smartphone to the energy powering the AI grid, the era of 'cheap and easy' is over, signaling that the race for physical essentials has begun. The companies profiled below share one trait: They own the inventory. They are the load-bearing walls of the 2026 economy. This isn't a rotation. It is a scramble for the essentials. THE DIAGNOSTIC HUB Ventripoint Diagnostics (TSXV: VPT) (OTCQB: VPTDF) is erasing the geographic blind spot in cardiac care through its landmark partnership with the Nisg̱a'a Valley Health Authority to deploy AI-driven 3D heart mapping. In 2026, the most acute bottleneck in healthcare is visibility. For many, a heart diagnosis requires a long-distance flight or a months-long wait… That's the type of delay that can turn a treatable condition into a tragedy. Ventripoint is essentially putting the power of a multi-million dollar MRI room into a portable ultrasound. It’s a tech bridge that brings world-class heart diagnostics to rural communities that have been waiting years for a "clear picture". This is not a pilot project; it is a blueprint for sovereign healthcare infrastructure. By bringing hospital-grade diagnostics to the point of care, Ventripoint is proving that you don't need to move the patient to see the problem. The equipment is already in the clinic; Ventripoint provides the AI 'brain' that turns a standard ultrasound into a life-saving diagnostic tool.

While the macro argument for gold has been won, the execution argument is just beginning. Lake Victoria Gold isn't just looking for gold; they’re building the 'factory' to extract it. They are setting up shop right next door to one of the most productive gold mines (Barrick's) on the planet, turning historical data into a modern production engine. Recent drilling didn't just find gold; it proved the deposit goes far deeper than anyone expected, potentially rewriting the scale of the entire project. This is the Scarcity Doctrine in action: LVG is not just hunting for a discovery; it is manufacturing a mine. By combining a near-term production profile with the bonanza-grade discovery leverage at Tembo, the company is securing its position as a major gold factory in one of the world's most productive belts.

It's about owning the daily ritual of the modern professional. People are ditching sugar-heavy drinks and the stigma of vaping for a discreet, focused boost that fits right in their pocket. On January 12, the company accelerated this roadmap by engaging McKinney Regulatory Science Advisors to navigate the complex scientific and regulatory path for its oral pouch pipeline. This is a high-execution pivot. In late 2024, Doseology secured a critical manufacturing agreement via its U.S. subsidiary, positioning the company for commercial production of caffeine, nicotine, and functional ingredient pouches. The strategic importance of this move is underscored by the involvement of retail legend Joseph Mimran, who joined as a Strategic Advisor following the acquisition of Feed That Brain™. Mimran's expertise in building category-defining brands like Joe Fresh is being applied to Doseology's mission: providing a clean, functional alternative to energy drinks and tobacco. By owning the delivery method, Doseology is aiming to become the 'daily ritual' for a generation that demands performance without the crash.

(TSXV: AMCO) (OTCQB: AMCOF) is moving aggressively to unlock the next major silver district in Nevada, having just commenced its 2026 field program at the Trinity Silver Project in Pershing County. On January 12, the company deployed advanced drone-borne magnetometry to map a system interpreted to be structurally similar to the world-class silver deposits of Bolivia. They aren't guessing where the silver is; they are using advanced tech to restart a district with a proven history of multi-million-ounce production. The data is already surfacing. Recent grab samples on newly consolidated ground have returned bonanza grades of up to 1,690 g/t silver and 4.33 g/t gold. Think of silver as the 'digital glue' of 2026. Without it, the AI revolution stops. Americore is hunting for this essential tech-metal in Nevada, one of the safest and most proven mining jurisdictions on the map. Americore is ground-truthing a historical giant in the safest mining jurisdiction on Earth. Holding high-grade silver inventory in a Tier-1 jurisdiction like Nevada is the ultimate strategic play. Read this and more news for Americore Resources news at: https://americoreresources.com/news THE IMMUNO-ENGAGER GT Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: GTBP) has officially unlocked the door to the $362 billion solid tumor market, announcing the IND submission for GTB-5550 to the U.S. FDA. While the immuno-oncology sector is crowded, the "Choke Point" remains the same: getting the immune system to effectively attack solid masses. GT Biopharma's proprietary TriKE® platform solves this by engineering a molecular bridge. GTB-5550 is a dual-nanobody "Tri-Specific Killer Engager" (TriKE) that tethers a patient's Natural Killer (NK) cells directly to B7-H3 expressing tumors, driving proliferation and killing power simultaneously. This is a decisive expansion. While the company is already enrolling patients for myeloid blood cancers, this new IND opens the aperture to a market orders of magnitude larger—including prostate, breast, and lung cancers. With a cash runway extending into Q3 2026 and a patient-friendly subcutaneous dosing profile, GT Biopharma is moving from "Science Project" to "Clinical Scale," positioning itself as the primary "delivery system" for the next generation of solid tumor immunotherapy.

Title: New World Finds its Destiny Revealed – A Shut Down Date of January 31, 2027

We knew the end was coming. We have known it was going to happen since late October when Amazon announced that they were purging their gaming studios, preferring to pursue a future built on an AI driven Snoop Dogg path than anything approximating a world. Dreams of Middle-earth crumbled and when it came to New World… well, this is what I wrote at the time. Then there is New World. That title is a dead man walking if ever there was one. We all know it. It is just a question of how much longer it will last. I won’t claim to be a clairvoyant in having predicted the obvious. As it turns out, I wasn’t even pessimistic enough. In my new year’s predictions I allowed that Amazon would announce the game’s closure, but that it might last through the end of 2026. In a surprise, especially to myself, I may have hit that one on the nose. Welcome to a New World… please exit through the gift shop Yesterday Amazon made an announcement that New World would shut down on January 31, 2027. The text of the announcement, since the support site will go away as soon as the game is gone, reads as follows: A few months ago we shared with you, our valued community, that no additional content would come to New World: Aeternum after the Nighthaven seasonal update. We also said more details on what’s happening next, alongside other essential information, would soon follow. Today, we’re here to share updates and provide transparency on where the game goes from here. New World: Aeternum will officially be taken offline from all platforms on January 31, 2027. On January 15, 2026, the title will be delisted and no longer available for purchase. Players will still be able to play New World: Aeternum on their purchased platform, and we are extending the Nighthaven season until the servers are taken offline on January 31, 2027. We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community. It has been our pleasure to work on New World: Aeternum and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us. I am a bit surprised Amazon kept their promise. Back in October they said they would give at least six months notice on the fate of New World. I would not have been at all surprised if they had decided to ignore that and plead special circumstances requiring an early shuttering of the game. So if you still want to play some more of New World, you have time. If you have never played it… well, the opportunity has passed for you. As noted in the quoted section above, the game was delisted and made unavailable for purchase yesterday. There was also a short FAQ appended to the announcement, which reiterates some of the points. So it will be around and they’ll keep it running. You can finish out your completionist needs, but there won’t be anything new. As for the history of the game as we enter into its final chapter… well, it was a strange ride. Amazon announced a business model of “buy the box” with a cosmetic cash shop, which was enough to move a million units pretty quickly when it launched at the end of September 2021. In the first week Steam showed it putting up big numbers, beating out the perennial favorites of the time, CS:GO and Dota 2. SteamDB numbers at 19:04 UTC on Sunday Oct 3rd That led to some amazing server queues. Server queues on Tuesday of launch week 25,001 queued up for a server… that is a hell of a queue for a server that was set to hold something like 2,000 players back at launch. But Amazon had a plan for that! They had their special sauce server technology that let them spin up new servers. There were issues, but no less than Bezos himself was talking to the press about having a hit game on his hands. And then it started going wrong. Not enough planning? Too much success? There was the launch in late September and by early December Josh Strife Hayes has a whole what went wrong video chronicling the problems and missteps of the team. By May of 2022 it was the subject of a Death of a Game video, another run through the litany of mistakes. But it didn’t go away. The team worked on the problems, released updates, and kept on going. Nothing could get that day one mojo back however. The Steam numbers declined and never bounced back anywhere close to their peak. Our group kept at it until February, then jumped over to Lost Ark. I kept an eye on the game, but every time I went back to poke my nose in, my old server had gone MIA and I had to pick a new one. But the team was still able to get a rise out of their audience… but not in a good way when they tried to rename, rebrand, re-genre the whole thing for the console launch. Old World, New Name They were clearly trying to distance themselves from the PC title and the initial announcement made people wonder if this was a new game, something different that what was out there, something only for consoles that would leave PC players behind. It was confusing in the moment. I summed up my reaction in meme form. Re-enactment of my moment of discovery… On Steam, the core remaining audience felt betrayed and the review bombing commenced. That had to sting… The team had to go into damage control mode, having realized that they had screwed up badly. Not for the first time. So the PC players felt alienated and the console customers were not enough to make up the difference. The team kept on working, but there was nothing for it. The reputation had been set. It was yesterday’s new with nothing splashy and new enough to revive its fortune. From the right angle one might be surprised that it lasted as long as it did. And who knows how the financials looked. Amazon is big enough that they can hide anything in their quarterly results. But the ongoing downturn in the industry post-Covid did for it in the end. Amazon didn’t just dump New World, it bailed on anything like deep or serious titles when the layoffs came. I will likely put together a more detailed timeline of my own views and involvement with the game when the end comes. I have a year to dwell on that. Our group dug into it for a while, and it did have its charms. It remains in my top ten most played titles on Steam, ahead of Lost Ark, if that is any consolation. We shall see how things play out over the next 12 months. Maybe somebody will buy it. Related: Never played it, but I remember around its launch hoping it was something decent. Of course also around that time I still had some faith in Amazon as a company overall. How quickly all these things change. LikeLike It definitely had things going for it and could have survived on a vibe of being sufficiently different from WoW. But the team also ignored many of the lessons of the past 20 years of online games and ended up making so many mistakes. They didn’t even have a test server until months later, so would just push patches to prod, breaking things in ways that players spotted within minutes. Had nearly a million concurrent players, and blew it. We’ve heard that story before. LikeLike I didn’t buy it and now I’m a tad regretful about that, because it might be fun to join as a tourist during the final year. The console experiment is especially sad because one recurring lesson in this space is: never give up your core audience. Whatever market you have identified to replace them almost never materializes – at a minimum it is a risk in the “foolhardy” range. Looking at you, Star Wars: Galaxies… LikeLike Yes, I am always irate when people suggest that a game could get a bazillion new players if only they would completely betray and abandon their current users to suit the tastes of that one individual. Changing horses mid-stream is complicated and has an extremely low success rate. I can think of a couple, but they mostly prove that the original idea was wrong. LikeLike I was going to do a post on it but you’ve covered everything. I’ll probably do one at some point before it closes for good but there’s no rush now. A year’s notice is plenty of time to get anything done that’s still left to do, I guess. It would be great if Amazon would sell it but they won’t, of course. It would make an excellent purchase for a smaller company with a focus on running online games, even if they only ran it in maintenance mode like Gamigo runs Rift. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn’t need the kind of small change a company like that would be willing to pay. Or indeed any amount of money from anyone. Maybe someone will put an emulator together. A year is a good length of time to gather all the data they’d need. LikeLike I am a bit surprised they won’t let anyone buy in this far out. I have the impression that the window is usually closer to a few months than a year, but I have zero data points to back that up and really don’t care to research it right now for a random comment, so I may be mistaken. I hope that the Rust developer (a) is serious and (b) Amazong goes for it. It seems like 25 million would be better than 0 million, but there may be a tax write off or something else behind the scense they feel is worth more. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Today’s top news: A surprising new investment juxtaposes the face of Ethereum with the face of all content. 📌 What Happened BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) announced a $200M investment into the financial platform initiative led by YouTube creator MrBeast. BitMine is backing the platform’s broader vision to offer on-chain financial products, including DeFi integrations tied to BitMine’s Ethereum treasury and MrBeast’s massive user base (200M+ subscribers). Key data points: The investment news coincided with broader momentum for BitMine’s public narrative in 2026, fueled by ETH’s +12% start to the year. 🗣️ What They’re Saying Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, said the firm would explore ways to “incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform” 🧠 Why It Matters This investment is notable for a few reasons. First, this is the first time we’ve seen a crypto DAT use its capital for a meaningful investment outside of crypto tokens. Most DATs simply raise capital and buy their respective token (i.e. BMNR and ETH), and if holders are lucky, the team will squeak out some additional ROI via yield. Tom and team are going a different route by using growth capital to make “moonshot” bets. And that makes BMNR a much more interesting bet than some other DATs out there (you get the ETH upside + the moonshot upside). This is also meaningful for potential mainstream adoption. MrBeast’s platform is huge and his new finance-focused app is a perfect opportunity to get crypto finance into retail. Overall this feels like a major statement from Tom Lee—BMNR is going on offense, not just playing defense in 2026.

Title: Rust Exec Reacts To Amazon Killing New World: ‘Games Should Never Die’

Amazon Game StudiosNew WorldRust New World was once the crown jewel in Amazon’s rising gaming ambitions. Developed in-house, the MMO initially exploded in popularity on Steam and seemed to have decent legs in the notoriously competitive genre. Less than five years later, it’s officially being killed. Servers will go offline in January 2027. The news has prompted a reaction from many who are tired of big games vanishing so quickly after launch, including an executive at Rust maker Facepunch Studios. “25m, final offer Amazon Games,” the London-based company’s COO, Alistair McFarlane, wrote in response to the news on X. “Games should never die,” he added, before going on to juxtapose Amazon’s approach to online games with Facepunch’s. “As with everything we do at Facepunch, empower the community.” when someone asked what the Rust maker buying New World would look like. “Give them control, make servers publicly hostable. A game will live forever in the hands of a dedicated community.” The writing for New World has been on the wall since last fall. Despite recently releasing new updates and seasonal content changes appearing to come and go as planned, Amazon announced in late October that the game would be going on life support with no meaningful additions planned in the future. The servers would remain open and operating âthrough 2026â to allow the community âtime to continue their adventures in Aeternum.â Games should never die. — Alistair McFarlane (@Alistair_McF) January 15, 2026 While Amazon is technically holding up that end of the bargain, remaining fans probably weren’t expecting the tech giant to kick the new year off with a full-blown death sentence. “We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you,” an unattributed blog post that went up on the game’s website this week reads. “Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, weâre honored that we were able to share so much with the community.” New World is no longer for sale but anyone who already owns it can still re-download the game and play until January 31, 2027. Will there be any refunds? Of course not. Can you still buy premium in-game currency for real money? Strangely, yes. “Beginning July 20, 2026, players will no longer be able to purchase Marks of Fortune or anything else in game,” reads the new FAQ. Why not unlock everything and make all cash transactions in the game free? No idea. All of this stems from Amazon’s wider pivot away from internal game development, with mass layoffs last fall that included not only the end of New World but seeming cuts to other projects including a Lord of the Rings MMO. The company hasn’t confirmed if that project is dead or still being shopped around to other outside development partners. Amazon is also set to publish the upcoming Tomb Raider games, including this year’s Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, a remake of the original game. Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Title: Amazon's once-hailed fantasy MMO New World will vanish from servers in a year's time

You can no longer buy it, as of this week Amazon’s colonial fantasy MMO New World (latterly rebranded New World: Aeternum) is no longer available for purchase as of yesterday, and will be taken offline for good from 31st January 2027, the publishers have announced. The news follows the release of the game’s final major update back in October, amid mass layoffs at Amazon. Alongside the similarly ill-fated Crucible and Breakaway, New World was once a key plank of Amazon’s push to become a big mover in the games industry - amplifying its existing success as a provider of software and web services, and luring yet more innocent souls into the toxic swamp of the Amazon Prime subscription business. Announced in 2016, it underwent several delays amid reports of corporate dysfunction in Amazon's embryonic studio empire, eventually launching out of beta in 2021, with a storyline conclusion landing in 2022. Alice Bee (RPS in peace) was mildly enthused by New World at launch, calling the game “a fresh, swashbuckling MMO that's still very grindy early on”. Ed Thorn (also RPS in peace) liked the emphasis on crafting. It had over 700,000 players on Steam on release day. But then it proceeded to lose over 90% of its players in a matter of months. I never played New World myself, mostly because I try to avoid anything associated with Amazon, but it never struck me as particularly fascinating from afar – familiar combat and quest mechanics with some convoluted magic settler politics. Still, I’m sorry for any New World developers who’ve lost their jobs as a result of this latest “sunsetting”. In general, I'll take a lacklustre MMO over Jeff Bezos's desire to move humans into giant, Amazon-run space stations. The game’s live service will continue to operate before the servers are pulled, with recurring world bosses and bonus weeks. The devs will also keep an eye out for bugs and performance issues. But there will be no more content additions or server merges. You’ll be able to buy in-game currencies such as Marks of Fortune until July 20, 2026 – beware that Amazon are not offering refunds for such purchases. “We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion,” the devs write on their official site. “We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community." Any New World veterans reading? I’d like to read some reminiscing. Rock Paper Shotgun is better when you sign in Sign in and join us on our journey to discover strange and compelling PC games.

Title: The Venezuela Technocracy Connection

Full Content:
In the early morning hours of January 3, 2026, the United States military launched military strikes on Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Maduro and Flores have since been transported to the New York City to face charges relating to gun crimes and cocaine trafficking. The move has divided the MAGA base—and the American public more generally—with a large portion of President Donald Trump’s base viewing it as a betrayal of the principles he claimed to champion. Specifically, Trump has claimed for years he would not start new wars of aggression. While Trump has stated that taking out Maduro is not about launching new wars but instead a calculated attack to take out a man he blames for America’s fentanyl crisis, the facts tell another story. In May 2025, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) released its 2025 National Drug Threat Assessment (NDTA). This report mentions Venezuela trafficking fentanyl to the US a total of zero times. Instead, it blames Mexican cartels for the manufacturing and trafficking of fentanyl. This should come as no surprise to anyone paying attention, as these facts are common knowledge among the US government and drug-trafficking researchers. A second key point is that although Trump and neocon Secretary of State Marco Rubio have repeatedly sought to tie Maduro to drug cartels, there remains scant evidence for the claim. The US government previously claimed Maduro was the head of the drug-trafficking group Cartel de los Soles (also known as the Cartel of the Suns). However, many skeptics have claimed the group doesn’t actually exist. During Trump’s first term, Maduro was indicted as the alleged leader of this cartel. In 2025, during his second term, Cartel de los Soles was officially designated a foreign terrorist organization. However, when Maduro was brought to NYC and officially charged, the US Department of Justice dropped the allegations from their indictment. The lack of charges relating to Cartel de los Soles is a signal that the US government does not believe it has strong enough evidence to convict Maduro in court. Instead, they have changed their tune and are now claiming Maduro was involved in cocaine trafficking. Hours after the raid and capture of Maduro, Trump held a press conference in which he made it perfectly clear that, despite official claims of targeting drug traffickers, the US government’s interest lies in gaining control over Venezuela’s oil industry. Make No Mistake – Venezuela is About Oil and Empire During a Saturday morning press conference, US President Donald Trump made it perfectly clear that despite claims of going after drug traffickers, the US government is interested in taking over the Venezuelan oil industry. pic.twitter.com/AJiyrh83j9 “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” Trump stated. In 2007, Venezuela nationalized oil projects, seizing assets from companies such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips after they refused to accept terms that would give the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) majority control. In contrast, companies like Total, Chevron, Statoil (now Equinor), and BP agreed to the restructuring and retained minority stakes in their Venezuelan projects. Trump has claimed that these actions were a theft of American oil and that part of the US presence in Venezuela will be to take this oil. “In addition, Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets, and American platforms costing us billions and billions of dollars. This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country. Considered the largest theft of property in the history of our country,” Trump said at the Saturday morning press conference. When pressed by journalists about his comments regarding the US “running” Venezuela, Trump responded by claiming that the oil companies would cover the costs of improvements to Venezuelan oil infrastructure. “Well, we’re gonna be running it with a group and we’re gonna make sure it’s run properly. We’re gonna rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars. It’ll be paid for by the oil companies directly.” However, Trump also appeared to suggest that US taxpayers would subsidize oil companies to rebuild the infrastructure. “They will be reimbursed for what they’re doing, but, that’s gonna be paid. And we’re gonna get the oil flowing the way it should be,” Trump claimed. In an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump made a similar statement. “I think we can do it in less time than that, but it’ll be a lot of money,” he said. “A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.” With Trump admitting that a major motivation for taking out Maduro was to benefit oil companies, it’s important to ask which companies are involved and who holds shares in them. Chevron, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips were involved in Venezuela’s oil sector before the nationalization under Hugo Chávez and during the subsequent US sanctions era. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are the majority institutional shareholders of all three companies, typically controlling around 20-25% of the shares in each (with Vanguard and BlackRock often holding the largest stakes among institutions). Larry Fink is the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of BlackRock. He’s also the current Interim Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum. Fink also maintains a close relationship with Donald Trump, having known him for over 40 years due to both men having been involved in the Manhattan financial scene. In fact, in March 2025 it was announced that Larry Fink had consulted with Trump before he secured the purchase of two ports in the Panama Canal for BlackRock. Given Trump’s close relationship with Larry Fink, combined with BlackRock’s significant investments in major U.S. oil companies such as Chevron, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips, these are more than likely influencing factors in the U.S. policy toward Venezuela’s oil sector. Fink is not the only billionaire benefiting handsomely from the capture of Maduro and the US occupation of the Venezuelan oil industry. Among the billionaires celebrating the US aggression is Paul Singer, a billionaire hedge fund manager whose firm, Elliot Investment Management, has long sought to acquire CITGO Petroleum, the US-based subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA. In November 2025, a U.S. judge approved a $5.9 billion bid by an Elliott affiliate (Amber Energy) to purchase shares in CITGO’s parent company (PDV Holding) through a court-organized auction aimed at satisfying creditors’ claims against Venezuela. The sale still requires final approval from the U.S. Treasury Department and other regulators. CITGO’s assets include three major oil refineries (in Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois), pipelines, terminals, and more than 4,000 CITGO-branded gas stations across the United States. With Trump relaxing sanctions on Venezuelan oil following the removal of Maduro, Singer stands to benefit to the tune of billions if the CITGO sale is eventually approved. Coincidentally, Singer was a major donor to Trump’s presidential campaigns, as well as to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). US Representative Thomas Massie has also claimed that Singer has already spent more than $1 million in an attempt to defeat him in his upcoming reelection bid. According to Grok, Paul Singer, globalist Republican mega-donor who’s already spent $1,000,000 to defeat me in the next election, stands to make billions of dollars on his distressed CITGO investment, now that this administration has taken over Venezuela.https://t.co/hq1STlEyAq It’s quite obvious that oil is one of the major drivers behind the US kidnapping of Maduro, but drugs and oil alone do not fully explain why Trump is desperate to have control over this region. In the early 20th century, a movement emerged around a political theory known as Technocracy—a system in which government and society would be managed by technical experts, often involving technology-focused solutions. Early proponents claimed that Technocracy would lead to better management of resources and the protection of the planet. However, this system of governance by technological experts and their technology would also involve a loss of privacy, as well as centralization of power and the management of all human behavior. One of the most influential proponents of Technocracy was a man named Howard Scott, a writer and engineer who founded the Technical Alliance in New York City in 1919. Scott believed that business owners lacked the necessary skills and data to reform their industries, and thus control should be handed over to engineers and scientists. In 1932, Scott and fellow technocrat Walter Rautenstrauch established the “Committee on Technocracy” at Columbia University. The group would eventually splinter, with Scott leading Technocracy Incorporated, while technocrat Harold Loeb headed the rival Continental Committee on Technocracy. In 1938, Technocracy Incorporated released a publication that outlined its vision for a Technocracy and their plan for merging North America and parts of central America into a single continental unit which they called a “Technate”: Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent. For the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific, technical, engineering problem. There will be no place for Politics or Politicians, Finance or Financiers, Rackets or Racketeers. Technocracy states that price and abundance are incompatible; the greater the abundance the smaller the price. In a real abundance there can be no price at all. Only by abandoning the interfering price control and substituting a scientific method of production and distribution can an abundance be achieved. Technocracy will distribute by means of a certificate of distribution available to every citizen from birth to death. The Technate will encompass the entire American Continent from Panama to the North Pole because the natural resources and the natural boundary of this area make it an independent, self- sustaining geographical unit. [emphasis added] A 1940 map from Technocracy Inc. clearly shows this vision included Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central American countries—including Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Guatemala, and others. The fact that Panama was envisioned as part of the Technate should not be forgotten in light of Larry Fink’s efforts to purchase ports in the Panama Canal. The Technocrats also imagined controlling parts of Venezuela and even Colombia. The 1940 map shows portions of northern Venezuela and eastern Colombia absorbed by the Technate. Colombia’s place in the proposed Technate adds important context to Trump’s recent threats of military action in the nation. The Technocrats were not only focused on incorporating Central and South American nations into the Technate. They aimed to spread their techno-tyranny as far north as Greenland. In a July 1940 issue of Technocracy magazine, Howard Scott and Technocracy Inc. explicitly advocated for acquisition of Greenland: “The government of the United States should take immediate action to acquire these territories and others, such as Greenland and the Galapagos Islands. The acquisition of these territories should be a mandatory part of the program of Continental defense for immediate achievement—either by purchase, negotiation, or the force of arms. The original Technocrats’ plans for taking control over Greenland has repeatedly been echoed by Trump since taking office in 2025. Following the kidnapping of Maduro, Trump and allies have renewed their calls for taking the island. On Monday, Trump’s top adviser and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller claimed that Greenland belonged to the United States and that the US military could seize the semiautonomous Danish territory. “Nobody’s going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller told Jake Tapper on CNN. “We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” On Tuesday, the Trump White House reiterated the potential for military action against Greenland, telling Reuters: “The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal.” By Thursday, Trump was floating a plan to pay Greenlanders between $10,000 to $100,000 per person to convince them to secede from Denmark and join the United States. On January 3rd, Katie Miller—the wife of Stephen Miller—posted a meme of Greenland overlaid in American flag colors with the single word “SOON.” Notably, Katie Miller was an adviser and spokesperson for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and then an employee of him directly before leaving to start a podcast. Katie Miller, the wife of psycho Stephen Miller, calling for taking Greenland.Trump is the perfect puppet for the Technocrats and helping fulfil the original Technocrats plan of the North American Technate which just so happens to include Greenland and Venezeula. https://t.co/L4hHT110L3 The fact that both Stephen and Katie Miller are publicly advocating for the US takeover of Greenland—given their proximity to Musk—is significant. Elon Musk’s grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was a research director for Technocracy Incorporated of Canada and national chairman of the Social Credit Party. Musk is simply following in his grandfather’s footsteps as he and the numerous Technocrats surrounding Trump work to bring about the original vision of the American Technate. As The Last American Vagabond has been reporting for years, it has become increasing clear that we are witnessing the MAGA movement—which largely believes it is the “resistance” to the “globalist elite”—capitulate and make excuses as Trump stacks his administration with Technocrats, including members and attendees of the secretive Bilderberg Group, the World Economic Forum, and the WEF’s Young Global Leaders program. I outlined these connections in numerous articles in 2025, including Meet The Peter Thiel Acolytes in Donald Trump’s 2nd Administration, Meet the Man Whose Philosophy Has Influenced Peter Thiel and the Technocrats, and Welcome to the Palantir World Order. I highlighted the fact that under Donald Trump, two members of the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group—Peter Thiel and Alex Karp—are running Palantir and securing an increasing number of military-industrial complex contracts. This is yet another clear sign that Trump is not fighting the “deep state.” One prime example of this Technocratic deep state nexus is Michael Kratsios. Kratsios is one of dozens of Peter Thiel acolytes in the second Trump administration. He was appointed by Trump to serve as Science Adviser to the President and Director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served in a similar role during the first Trump administration, as well as Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and policy specialist on artificial intelligence, drones, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. He also worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital. In June 2025, Kratsios attended the Bilderberg meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. Why is @MichaelKratsios, Trump's Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, attending Bilderberg? Remember, this is the same guy I reported has worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital: https://t.co/toIOJG35LA pic.twitter.com/I2dEMGC7LU Kratsios is also part of Trump’s efforts to limit how states can regulate Artificial Intelligence. Speaking at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show, he said the White House was preparing a legislative proposal to establish a national AI framework and prevent what he described as market fragmentation caused by inconsistent state rules. There is simply no denying that Donald Trump is helping usher in the Technocratic State backed by the likes of Palantir goons Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, Zionists, and modern-day Technocrats such as Elon Musk, David Sacks, and Howard Lutnick. What we are witnessing with Venezuela and Greenland is one more step in the completion of the American Technate and one step closer to the vision of a global government.

Title: Rust Director Just Offered Amazon $25 Million to Get New World and Keep It Alive

It didn't take long for Amazon to decide when New World would be taken offline. As you might remember, the gaming division of the giant corporation announced that no more content would be made for the game just three months ago, while also quietly canceling the in-development The Lord of the Rings MMO project. Yesterday, Amazon revealed that New World had been delisted from stores, making it unavailable for new purchases, and clarified the date the servers will go offline forever: January 31, 2027. While that's over a year away, having a definitive shutdown date is a particularly sad occurrence for any MMO. Unlike regular games, MMOs are actual virtual worlds inhabited by thousands of players on each server, creating permanent communities and social structures such as guilds. For some players, losing access is a bit like losing connection to places and people you've come to appreciate. That's why communities often fight to keep them alive one way or another. That sentiment is indeed very strong for New World, which was doing better with the latest updates released by the developers and was actually trending upward in player counts - just not as much as Amazon desired. The game's community has discussed ways to keep the game alive; there's precedent for it, chiefly with City of Heroes, the superhero-themed MMORPG created by Cryptic Studios and later acquired by NCSoft. When NCSoft shut down the game in 2012, fans spun up a private server, and the server code leak in April 2019 led to multiple private servers. One in particular, called Homecoming, eventually emerged above all others, and NCSoft granted Homecoming an official license to host the game in 2024. That was about the best outcome New World fans could hope for. However, in a veritable twist, Alistair McFarlane, COO and Company Director at Facepunch (the British developer behind Rust and Garry's Mod), tweeted a $25 million 'offer' to purchase the game from Amazon, adding that 'games should never die'. Needless to say, having an actual professional game studio pick up the game would be far better. Amazon also demonstrated they are not actually averse to the idea; as part of their mass gaming layoffs, they sold the upcoming MOBA, March of Giants, to Ubisoft. The difference is that in that case, they sold the game alongside the development team based in Montréal, Canada, whereas most of the New World team is likely already gone. This would make it hard for a game like New World to sustain itself over time. Unlike sandbox games like Rust or Garry's Mod, the MMO is mostly themepark-based, meaning it sustains itself on developer-made content rather than user-generated content. Even if it acquired the license, Facepunch would still have to build a small team to keep it going and add new content every once in a while. We've reached out to Facepunch to ask whether McFarlane's offer was genuine in the first place and will update this story if and when they respond.

Daily Tech News 16 January 2026 Top Story The best graphics cards for gaming in 2026. (Tom's Hardware) At #2 is Nvidia's 5070 Ti, and at #5 is the 5060 Ti, both of which have ceased to exist. The best options for building a new PC with DDR4 RAM you already have. (Tom's Hardware) Both systems include the 5060 Ti, which as we have just noticed, has gone to the great parts bin in the sky. Nvidia has rebutted claims that the 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti are "end-of-life", insisting that all cards are still shipping and are just shagged out after a long render. (PC Magazine) The fact that you can't actually buy them is clearly a skill issue. Git gud, scrub. Hardware Unboxed - an Aussie hardware review channel - was planning a market roundup of currently available 5070 Ti models, and reached out to their industry contacts for review cards. There were no review cards to be had anywhere. (YouTube) Their contacts in the Australian retail market confirmed that there was no stock of the 5070 Ti at distributors at all, echoing recent reports from Germany and Japan. And Asus told them, and subsequently confirmed, that the 5070 Ti was "end-of-life", had ceased production, and would not be restocked. Then Nvidia... Clarified... That all RTX 5000 series cards are still in production, and Asus walked back earlier comments and agreed that the 5070 Ti is still in production. Hardware Unboxed requested - again - a review sample. There has been no response as yet. AMD meanwhile is working with its board partners to prevent GPU price hikes. (Notebook Check) Good luck with that. The 8GB 9060 XT seems to have bounced back up from its recent low price - it was briefly selling below MSRP - but it and the three 16GB cards (9060 XT, 9070, and 9070 XT) are all in stock. As is the 32GB 9700, though that model is quite expensive. Tech News TSMC plans to spend $56 billion on new production facilities and equipment this year. (WCCFTech) That's equal to three Nanyas. Reprompt is - or was, it's just been patched - a Copilot exploit that, once you clicked on the link, kept stealing your data even after you closed Copilot. (Hot Hardware) It worked like most so-called "Prompt Injection" vulnerabilities: It asked the AI for your data, and the AI helpfully handed it over because it has less self-interest than the average mycoplasma. This particular instance has been patched, but it was active in the wild for four months before Microsoft took action. This is why even people who use AI tools are up in arms about Microsoft integrating it directly into their operating system. If you use AI through your browser, it stops the moment you close the tab. Copilot never stops until you kill it with fire. Hot Hardware has a detailed article on removing it that involves running unsigned code directly out of GitHub because that may actually be safer than leaving Windows untouched. US senators are demanding answers from X (Twitter), Meta (Facebook), and Alphabet (Google) on sexualised deepfakes. (Tech Crunch) Answers to questions like "How do I do it?", "Does it have pictures of Sydney Sweeney?", and "You're not recording this are you? Stop recording right now!" Italy's privacy watchdog is under investigation for corruption and embezzlement. (Reuters) I am shocked, shocked, to see corruption and embezzlement going on in here! The Minisforum N5 Air is a $499 5-bay NAS. (Liliputing) It's a cheaper version of the N5 with a plastic rather than metal case, but otherwise almost identical. Apart from five 3.5" drive bays, it has room for three M.2 SSDs (with two running only at PCIe 4.0 x1 speed and one at x2), and includes a Ryzen 255 CPU, room for two DDR5 SODIMM modules (none as standard, so beware of that), and a whole lot of ports: OCuLink, two USB4 ports, 10Gb and 5Gb Ethernet, three USB3 10Gb ports, and HDMI. One of those USB3 ports is inside the system to host a boot device so that you can dedicate all the drives to data. The best office mini-PCs review by Notebookcheck. (Notebookcheck) Top spot goes to the Apple Mac Mini M4 Pro. With 64GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD, though, it costs more than three times as much as the same configuration for the Minisforum AI X1 at #5. (They list the 32GB model, but I bought the 64GB model.) The FDA has announced a recall of chocolate bars from Spring & Mulberry. (Southern Living) Then we have number four: Crunchy Frog. We use only the finest baby frogs, dew-picked and flown from Iraq, cleansed in the finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and sealed in a succulent, Swiss, quintuple-smooth, treble-milk chocolate envelope, and lovingly frosted with glucose. And what is this one: Spring Surprise? Ah, that's one of our specialities. Covered in dark, velvety chocolate, when you pop it into your mouth, stainless steel bolts spring out and plunge straight through both cheeks. Everything I ordered during my definitely not drunken New Years Eve shopping spree has now shipped. The SSDs doubled in price and the memory tripled the next day. I do need to pick up an AM4 CPU to use it all - the motherboard is on its way - but those are cheap and readily available.

Posted by: FenelonSpoke at January 16, 2026 05:48 AM (Nx5jP) 42 Yeah, I'm not believing a word from Nvidia on that 5070 Ti/5060 Ti walkback. They said the same thing about the availablility of their cards this time last year and it all turned out to be B.S., and that was before memory prices skyrocketed. Once they finally got their cards into the supply stream the prices were well above MSRP and still are for the higher VRAM cards, especially the 5080 and 5090 which have never come close to MSRP. So maybe they'll keep selling 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti but you probably aren't going to enjoy paying $1000 for what's supposed to be a $750 card, or $650 for what's supposed to be a $430 card. AMD can make some real headway here in the midrange GPU market if they don't shoot themselves in the foot.

Title: Future of Marketing Briefing: X claims an ad comeback, reality proves out a different thesis

Full Content:
This Future of Marketing Briefing covers the latest in marketing for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → A claim from X has has taken on a life of its own after I featured it in a story I wrote earlier this month. X’s ads boss said that nearly all of the platform’s top 100 advertisers were “back” without a breakout of who those advertisers were, no context around what “back” meant and no disclosure of how much money they were actually spending. I asked. There were no numbers forthcoming. “We are more focused on advertising than ever before,” said X’s global head of advertising Monique Pintarelli. “We have a number of brands that are not just back, they’re spending at or higher than pre-acquisition levels,” she added, without specific figures. Skepticism was warranted. On its own, the comments were thin. But in the churn of hot takes and screenshots, the remark quickly became shorthand for something much bigger — the idea that X’s advertising business was effectively healed. The article itself did not make that leap. It went out of its way not to. So consider this week’s briefing a reset. Not a redemption arc. Just a closer look at where X’s ad business actually sits right now. Short version: the comeback narrative has gotten ahead of the reality. The numbers — what little of them there are — support that. The original piece cited Sensor Tower data showing that while more than six in 10 of the biggest advertisers on X in 2022 are still spending on the platform, they are doing so at a fraction of their prior levels. Additional data only reinforces that. Digiday requested data from Ebiquity, which shared insights from clients, primarily of large multinational brand advertisers, that it provides digital governance and auditing services to. Clients work for over 75 of the top 100 global advertisers based on their advertising spend worldwide. Ad spend on X hasn’t recovered from its 2023 spend level based on Ebiquity’s data, staying roughly flat. The number of clients in Ebiquity’s database spending on X has gone down year-on-year: 40 in 2022, 25 in 2023, 11 in 2024 and seven in 2025, with the latest figure still subject to change as filings are finalized. Taken together, the data adds context to Pintarell’s comments. It is likely true that most of the platform’s top 100 advertisers have resumed some level of spending after pulling back in 2022 amid concerns over Elon Musk’s ownership. In some respects, it would be more surprising if they had not. What has followed since Musk’s takeover has hardly been a courtship. He has publicly ridiculed the advertising, undermined some parts of it and threatened legal action against others. In response, it would appear many advertisers returned to X with the bare minimum — enough to ease those tensions, not enough to signal confidence. Yes, there are outliers. But the idea that ad dollars have meaningfully returned — or that X’s ad business is anything close to “back” — is tenuous at best. Take GYK Antler, for example. The agency’s head of media Adam Telian said that none of the brands he works with have resumed spending on X, and the platform hasn’t been a part of the conversation for several years. Similarly, Brave Bison’s director of paid media Mark Byrne said that X has fallen down client wishlists and is rarely pushed proactively in media plans. An ensuing scandal will have only sharpened those concerns. In recent weeks, X’s AI tool Grok has been used to generate manipulated images of real people, including women and minors, in sexually explicit ways, often by removing their clothes. Users began documenting and reporting these examples in late December and into the new year. Though on Wednesday, X announced that the team has “implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” And while it’s a step in the right direction, it isn’t a total U-turn that prevents users from using Grok to create any other type of inappropriate content. For brand advertisers, this is not a footnote. It is the environment, one far removed from anything that resembles a stable or normalized marketplace. “There doesn’t seem to be a good handle on content safety such as what other platforms like Meta and TikTok have, which further leads me to believe that X isn’t the best option for many advertisers,” said paid social media expert Shamsul Chowdhury. It’s a perspective shared by Byrne, who noted that this recent issue has heightened sensitivity around where budgets end up. “For some advertisers, it extends beyond brand safety in the traditional sense into whether they want to be seen supporting certain environments at all,” he said. “That makes controls, exclusions and transparency more important than ever.” Which calls into question why any brand would ever want to fund a platform like X? Aside from the threat of being named, shamed and sued by Musk, the upside is hard to see. What remains may be less a vote of confidence than a form of inadvertent participation. Turns out, marketers could be buying ads on X without realizing. The platform makes a meaningful portion of its ads available via programmatic auctions, and in doing so makes it easier for marketers to end up there without ever making an affirmative decision to do so. Here’s how: when a marketer buys ads on Google Ads there’s a chance they will buy ads on X, which is available at cheap ad prices there following a deal struck in 2023. Moreover, because of those prices, Google’s buying algorithms may optimize spend toward those places. The only way to avoid this, is if marketers instruct those algorithms not to buy from X. “When I have been auditing brands’ Google Ads activity over the last year or so, X makes an appearance in placement reporting for the ones that are not critically reviewing where their ads are serving, which has caught out the majority of brands as to why that is happening in the first place,” said ad tech consultant Jonathan D’Souza Rauto.

Also in this story is the fact that X has big plans for the Super Bowl next month, from its Super Bowl portal, to a new Grok-powered BrandRanx tool for advertisers and users. ‘Intentionally being cautious’: Why the ad industry isn’t ready to let AI agents spend ad dollars While planning, buying and optimization autonomously by LLM-powered agents are always framed as just over the horizon, advertisers are clear on one thing: they want to use it to automate workflows, not automate buying decisions.
